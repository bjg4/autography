1. **Curated "Best Of" lists** - From FindThatPod, Goodpods, PodcastNotes
2. **David Senra's re-reads** - Books he spent 40+ hours on or re-read multiple times
3. **Acquired hosts' favorites** - Bernard Arnault, Brunello Cucinelli, Edwin Land, Kobe Bryant
4. **Most iconic founders** - Household names with proven business impact
5. **Recent high-engagement episodes** - Jensen Huang, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos

## Data Acquisition Strategy

### Step 1: Get Episode List with IDs
```bash
# Use YouTube Data API or yt-dlp to get full episode list
yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print "%(id)s %(title)s" \
  "https://www.youtube.com/@FoundersPodcast/videos" > founders_episodes.txt
```

### Step 2: Match Priority List to Video IDs
- Cross-reference episode numbers with YouTube titles
- Create priority download list

### Step 3: Download Priority 100
```bash
# Download only priority episodes as audio
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 \
  -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" \
  --download-archive downloaded.txt \
  -a priority_video_ids.txt
```

### Step 4: Transcribe with Parakeet
```bash
# Run Parakeet on downloaded audio
python transcribe_batch.py --input ./audio --output ./transcripts
```

---

## Estimated Effort

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Map episode numbers to YouTube IDs | 2-3 hours | Manual + script |
| Download 100 episodes (~100 hours audio) | 3-4 hours | ~50GB |
| Transcribe with Parakeet | 4-8 hours | Depends on GPU |
| Quality check + ad removal | 2-4 hours | Spot check |
| **Total** | **~12-20 hours** | **$0 cost** |

---

## Alternative: Tapesearch Bulk Download

If Tapesearch offers bulk transcripts:
1. Check if all 439 episodes are available
2. Evaluate transcript quality
3. May save 8-12 hours of transcription time
4. Still need to prioritize which 100 to focus on for MVP

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Get YouTube channel video list with IDs
2. [ ] Map priority episodes to video IDs
3. [ ] Download priority 100 audio files
4. [ ] Set up Parakeet transcription pipeline
5. [ ] Process and validate transcripts
6. [ ] Remove ad segments
7. [ ] Ingest into ChromaDB
