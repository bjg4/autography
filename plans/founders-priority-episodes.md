# Founders Podcast: Priority 100 Episodes

## Prioritization Strategy

Multiple signals since there's no official ranking:

1. **Curated "Best Of" lists** - FindThatPod, Goodpods, PodcastNotes
2. **David's re-reads** - Episodes where he spent 40+ hours
3. **Acquired hosts' favorites** - Bernard Arnault, Brunello Cucinelli, Edwin Land, Kobe Bryant
4. **David's stated favorites** - Todd Graves ("one of my favorite living founders")
5. **5-star ratings** - Les Schwab (Munger recommended), Michael Jordan
