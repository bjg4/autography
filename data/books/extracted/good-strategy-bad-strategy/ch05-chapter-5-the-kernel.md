**CHAPTER FIVE**



**THE KERNEL OF GOOD STRATEGY**


Good strategy is defined as coherent action supported by a


structured argument known as the "kernel," which comprises

three crucial elements:

1.

**Diagnosis**

- This defines the nature of the challenge, simplifying

complex realities into key aspects that are critical.

2.

**Guiding Policy**

- An overall approach identified to address the challenges

indicated in the diagnosis.

3.

**Coherent Actions**

- Actions designed to execute the guiding policy,

coordinated to work in unison towards a common goal.

The significance of the kernel lies in its simplicity, allowing

easy creation and evaluation of strategies. While many

elements such as visions and goals can support a strategy, the

core consists solely of the diagnosis, guiding policy, and

coherent actions.


**THE DIAGNOSIS**


A diagnosis answers the fundamental question: "What’s


going on here?" It identifies which parts of reality are critical,

linking facts into patterns and transforming one’s perspective

on the challenge. For instance, different interpretations of a

company's situation can lead to vastly different strategic

paths.

Starbucks' challenges illustrate how various individuals

might diagnose the same issue differently, leading to distinct

strategic responses. An effective diagnosis allows for a

simplified yet insightful understanding of complex situations,

facilitating relevant problem-solving.


**THE GUIDING POLICY**


The guiding policy is a framework outlining how to

overcome challenges identified in the diagnosis. It channels

actions without detailing exact steps, helping to prioritize and

organize efforts. A guiding policy, unlike a vision, details the

"how" of navigating the situation, ruling out irrelevant

actions by focusing on leveraging sources of advantage.

For example, IBM's strategy under Lou Gerstner transitioned

from a fragmented industry perspective to leveraging its

integrated capabilities for customer solutions, illustrating

how a guiding policy can direct coherent action.


**COHERENT ACTION**


This final element must translate the diagnosed situation and

guiding policy into actual action. Strategy centers on action 
decisions made and the direction taken. Coherent actions

work together, focusing resources and energy in a unified

way to tackle challenges.

The importance of coherence can be seen through examples,

such as the failure of Ford's strategy when actions

contradicted each other or the lack of coordination in

operational decisions in another organization. Effective

strategies emerge when actions align and support the defined

objectives, providing leverage to achieve desired outcomes.


**Conclusion**


Good strategy is fundamentally about harnessing power and

applying it intelligently to create a competitive advantage. It

utilizes various sources of power to coordinate actions and

achieve coherent goals, illustrating that while diagnosing and

guiding policies are essential, effective implementation

through actionable steps is critical for success.


**Example**


Key Point:The importance of coherent action in

executing strategy successfully.


Example:Imagine you’re the manager of a bustling

coffee shop chain. You’ve identified that customer

satisfaction is declining due to slow service during peak

hours (diagnosis). Your guiding policy might focus on

improving operational efficiency through staff training

and better scheduling. Now, coherent actions could

involve conducting regular training sessions for baristas,

introducing a new system for order management, and

ensuring peak-time shifts are adequately staffed. Each

action aligns with your diagnosis and guiding policy to

ensure a significant improvement in service speed,

ultimately leading to happier customers and increased

sales.


**Critical Thinking**


Key Point:The concept of 'coherent actions' as

defined in this chapter is essential for strategy

implementation.


Critical Interpretation:While Rumelt posits that coherent

actions are vital for effective strategy, critics might

argue that flexibility and adaptability in actions should

also be prioritized. Situations can change rapidly, and a

rigid adherence to predefined actions without room for

adjustment could hinder an organization's ability to

respond to new challenges. This view aligns with

emergent strategy theories (Mintzberg, 1994) which

posit that strategies should evolve in response to

ongoing market dynamics, not solely rely on initial

coherence. Readers might consider this juxtaposition to

Rumelt's perspective.
