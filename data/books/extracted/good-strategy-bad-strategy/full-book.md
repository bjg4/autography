**CHAPTER ONE**


**GOOD STRATEGY IS UNEXPECTED**


Good strategy thrives where others lack it; it has coherence


that aligns actions, policies, and resources toward significant

goals. Many organizations, however, juggle multiple

initiatives without a unified strategy, often defaulting to

simply "spend more and try harder."


**APPLE**


In the mid-1990s, Apple faced severe challenges against

Microsoft's Windows-Intel dominance. Amid bankruptcies

and tumult, CEO Gil Amelio attempted various fixes, but

drastic measures were needed. Steve Jobs returned in 1997,

and his approach was unexpected; he significantly downsized

Apple's product line, focusing on a single desktop and laptop

model, cutting peripheral products, and reducing overhead.

Jobs' strategy, while grounded in basic business principles,

was surprising in its execution. He eliminated complexity

and created a cohesive business model without pushing

ambitious numeric goals. His direction was not just about

survival; he patiently awaited the next opportunity, learning

from previous experiences to harness future market changes

effectively.


**DESERT STORM**


The first Gulf War showcased surprising strategic success by

U.S. forces under General Norman Schwarzkopf. While

media and military speculation focused on traditional, costly

assaults, Schwarzkopf devised a two-pronged strategy that

utilized deception and flanking maneuvers—known as the

"left hook"—to outsmart entrenched Iraqi defenses.

Schwarzkopf's success highlighted a focused, coherent

strategy that was surprising given the complexities involved

in military operations. His ability to prioritize one clear plan

and suppress conflicting interests from various military

factions, including maritime and air force strategies, was

essential. He demonstrated that effective leadership involves

making tough choices and refusing to dilute focus with

divergent objectives.


**ENVELOPMENT**


Complex organizations often confuse their objectives,

leading to scattered resources and ineffective strategies.

Successful strategy requires leaders willing to eliminate

distractions and narrow their focus—knowing what not to

pursue is just as critical as defining active goals. Good

strategy is marked by clarity and discipline in execution,

which is often unexpected in large entities.


**Example**


Key Point:The necessity of eliminating distractions

to focus on coherent strategic objectives.


Example:Imagine working for a thriving tech startup

that suddenly decides to launch ten different products

simultaneously to capture every market segment. As

you struggle to juggle these competing priorities,

day-to-day chaos ensues, and the company's vision

dilutes significantly. Instead, envision if leadership

chose to narrow its focus, perhaps solely developing a

groundbreaking AI application, investing time and

resources toward that singular goal. This unexpected

decision could inspire the entire team to unify behind a

strong, coherent strategy, fostering innovation and

increasing the likelihood of impactful success.


**Critical Thinking**


Key Point:Good strategy often emerges from

surprising decisions that simplify and unify efforts.


Critical Interpretation:Jobs’ and Schwarzkopf’s

strategies reveal that impactful outcomes can come from

clarity and unexpected choices, challenging

conventional wisdom. However, Rumelt’s perspective

may neglect the unpredictable nature of environments

where strategies will be implemented, indicating that

external dynamics and unforeseen circumstances can

significantly influence the effectiveness of what he

deems 'good strategy.' For alternative views on strategic

planning, consider references like 'The Innovator's

Dilemma' by Clayton Christensen, which discusses the

challenges of maintaining a focused strategy amidst

disruptive market forces.


## **Chapter 2 Summary : DISCOVERING** **POWER**

**CHAPTER TWO**


**DISCOVERING POWER**

This chapter discusses how good strategies derive from

insights into new strengths and weaknesses and viewing

situations from fresh perspectives. Such insights can reveal

advantages and threats that were previously unnoticed.


**A SLUNG STONE**

The story of David and Goliath illustrates how perceived

weaknesses can defeat apparent strengths. David, armed with

his sling, recognized Goliath's critical vulnerability—his

uncovered forehead. This story encapsulates the essence of

strategy: gaining strength through the discovery of hidden

advantages and creating asymmetries in power.


**WAL-MART**

The case of Wal-Mart's rise under Sam Walton exemplifies

finding hidden strengths in competitive situations. Initially

labeled as an underdog, Wal-Mart succeeded by breaking

conventional wisdom; it established large stores in small

towns and developed a sophisticated logistics system. Over

time, the discussion reveals Wal-Mart's systemic advantages

over competitors like Kmart, which suffered from inertia and

could not replicate Wal-Mart's integrated design of policies.

Walton’s strategy redefined the structure of retail by viewing

the network of stores as the core unit rather than individual

locations, leading to enhanced coordination and efficiency.

This strategic perspective shift allowed for the exploitation of

operational efficiencies that competitors could not match.


**ANDY MARSHALL**

Andy Marshall’s insights during the Cold War reflect a

strategic approach emphasizing the use of U.S. strengths to

exploit Soviet weaknesses. His analysis shifted focus from

reactive budgeting to proactive competition. By identifying

asymmetries and proposing cost-imposing strategies against

the Soviet Union, Marshall contributed to a more effective


defense strategy. This broader perspective on competitive

advantage—focusing on creating challenges for opponents

rather than merely balancing forces—aligns with the lessons

learned from the cases of David and Wal-Mart.

Overall, the chapter emphasizes that insightful strategy

should look beyond traditional definitions of strength and

weakness, recognizing the hidden powers that can be

leveraged for success.


**Example**


Key Point:Identify hidden strengths and

vulnerabilities for effective strategy formulation.


Example:Just like David effectively utilized his

slingshot to exploit Goliath's uncovered weakness, you

can analyze a situation in your own professional

life—say, a project that feels overwhelming due to a

large, established competitor. By re-evaluating your

strengths, perhaps you discover a unique expertise or a

niche market that your competences can address,

allowing you to approach the project with renewed

strategy and confidence. This insight not only highlights

overlooked advantages but also positions you to craft a

strategy that capitalizes on these hidden powers,

fostering innovative solutions that can outperform

seemingly dominant forces.


## **Chapter 3 Summary : BAD STRATEGY**

**CHAPTER 3: BAD STRATEGY**


**Understanding Bad Strategy**



Bad strategy stems from specific misconceptions and

dysfunctional leadership rather than the mere absence of a

good strategy. Recognizing bad strategy improves

effectiveness in assessing and creating strategy. The four

## **Chapter 4 Summary : WHY SO MUCH** **BAD STRATEGY?**







|Key Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|Chapter Title|Chapter Four: Why So Much Bad Strategy?|
|Reason for Bad Strategy|Prevalence is due to avoidance of rigorous strategic work, not miscalculations.|
|Unwillingness to Choose|Leaders fear tough decisions, leading to vague strategies lacking direction.|
|Template-Style Strategy|Use of boilerplate frameworks results in superficial strategies without depth.|
|New Thought|Belief in positive thinking overshadows actionable strategy, distracting from critical<br>analysis.|
|Example: Digital Equipment<br>Corporation|Indecision among executives led to weak strategy, resulting in decline and acquisition.|
|Optimal Strategy|Involves making difficult choices on resource allocation and prioritizing goals.|
|Consequences of Template-Style|Leads to vague visions and missions, failing to guide meaningful strategic progress.|
|Risks of Positive Thinking|Can lead to dangerous decision-making by neglecting risks and potential failures.|
|Summary|Bad strategy arises from avoidance of choices, reliance on templates, and emphasis on<br>positive thinking.|


**CHAPTER FOUR**


**WHY SO MUCH BAD STRATEGY?**


Bad strategy is prevalent not due to miscalculations, but

rather the avoidance of rigorous strategic work. Common

pathways to bad strategy include:

1.


**Unwillingness to Choose**

: Leaders may fear making tough decisions among competing

goals, resulting in vague strategies.

2.

**Template-Style Strategy**

: This involves applying boilerplate strategy frameworks

which lack depth and analytical rigor.

3.

**New Thought**

: The belief that a positive mindset alone can ensure success

overshadows actionable strategy.


**THE UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO**

**CHOOSE**


Strategy requires focus through difficult choices. The case of

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) illustrates the

consequences of indecision among executives. Varied

opinions on direction led to a weak consensus statement

instead of a concrete strategy. DEC suffered due to a failure

to adopt a clear path, leading to its decline and eventual

acquisition.

Optimal strategy requires making hard choices about


resource allocation—saying "no" to numerous aspirations is

crucial for effective strategy creation. Successful strategies

must navigate the psychological and political challenges of

prioritizing certain objectives over others.


**TEMPLATE-STYLE STRATEGY**


The rise of template-style strategic planning has led to

superficial strategies that satisfy organizational norms but

lack substance. Charismatic leadership has overshadowed

strategy, with leaders relying on buzzwords and inspirational

language rather than actionable plans. This results in vague

visions and missions that ultimately do not guide strategic

progress or provide meaningful insights.


**NEW THOUGHT**


The "New Thought" philosophy promotes the idea that

positive thinking can produce desired outcomes. However,

this mindset can detract from critical strategic analysis.

Effective strategy involves considering risks and potential

failures, rather than merely focusing on positive outcomes.

This oversimplification can lead to dangerous

decision-making practices in organizations.


In summary, bad strategy often arises from a combination of

avoidance of tough choices, reliance on generic templates,

and an overemphasis on positive thinking that undermines

critical analysis and effective strategic planning.


**Critical Thinking**


Key Point:Unwillingness to choose leads to

ineffective strategy formulation.


Critical Interpretation:While Rumelt emphasizes that

bad strategy primarily stems from the avoidance of

rigorous decision-making, it is vital to recognize that

organizations might struggle not only with indecision

but also with a lack of resources or information to make

informed choices. This perspective suggests that

misunderstandings about strategic alignment and

resource allocation could also contribute to ineffective

strategies. For instance, a study by Mintzberg (1994)

highlights how the environment's complexity can hinder

leaders from effectively choosing paths, calling into

question the simplicity of Rumelt's thesis. Exploring

alternative frameworks for decision making, like those

proposed in the works of Simon (1997), could provide a

more nuanced understanding of the nuances of

decision-making, extending beyond Rumelt's argument

that focuses predominantly on psychological factors.


## **Chapter 5 Summary : THE KERNEL** **OF GOOD STRATEGY**











|Element|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Diagnosis|Defines the nature of the challenge, simplifying<br>complexities into key aspects that matter.|Different interpretations of Starbucks' situation<br>leading to varied strategic paths.|
|Guiding<br>Policy|An overall approach to address diagnosed challenges,<br>organizing and prioritizing efforts without detailing exact<br>steps.|IBM's strategy shift under Lou Gerstner to<br>leverage integrated capabilities for customer<br>solutions.|
|Coherent<br>Actions|Actions designed to execute the guiding policy, working<br>together toward a common goal.|Ford’s strategy failure due to contradictory actions<br>and lack of coordination in operational decisions.|
|Conclusion|Good strategy is about intelligently applying power to<br>create competitive advantage through coherent action.|Effective implementation through actionable steps<br>is critical for success.|


**CHAPTER FIVE**



**THE KERNEL OF GOOD STRATEGY**


Good strategy is defined as coherent action supported by a


structured argument known as the "kernel," which comprises

three crucial elements:

1.

**Diagnosis**

- This defines the nature of the challenge, simplifying

complex realities into key aspects that are critical.

2.

**Guiding Policy**

- An overall approach identified to address the challenges

indicated in the diagnosis.

3.

**Coherent Actions**

- Actions designed to execute the guiding policy,

coordinated to work in unison towards a common goal.

The significance of the kernel lies in its simplicity, allowing

easy creation and evaluation of strategies. While many

elements such as visions and goals can support a strategy, the

core consists solely of the diagnosis, guiding policy, and

coherent actions.


**THE DIAGNOSIS**


A diagnosis answers the fundamental question: "What’s


going on here?" It identifies which parts of reality are critical,

linking facts into patterns and transforming one’s perspective

on the challenge. For instance, different interpretations of a

company's situation can lead to vastly different strategic

paths.

Starbucks' challenges illustrate how various individuals

might diagnose the same issue differently, leading to distinct

strategic responses. An effective diagnosis allows for a

simplified yet insightful understanding of complex situations,

facilitating relevant problem-solving.


**THE GUIDING POLICY**


The guiding policy is a framework outlining how to

overcome challenges identified in the diagnosis. It channels

actions without detailing exact steps, helping to prioritize and

organize efforts. A guiding policy, unlike a vision, details the

"how" of navigating the situation, ruling out irrelevant

actions by focusing on leveraging sources of advantage.

For example, IBM's strategy under Lou Gerstner transitioned

from a fragmented industry perspective to leveraging its

integrated capabilities for customer solutions, illustrating

how a guiding policy can direct coherent action.


**COHERENT ACTION**


This final element must translate the diagnosed situation and

guiding policy into actual action. Strategy centers on action 
decisions made and the direction taken. Coherent actions

work together, focusing resources and energy in a unified

way to tackle challenges.

The importance of coherence can be seen through examples,

such as the failure of Ford's strategy when actions

contradicted each other or the lack of coordination in

operational decisions in another organization. Effective

strategies emerge when actions align and support the defined

objectives, providing leverage to achieve desired outcomes.


**Conclusion**


Good strategy is fundamentally about harnessing power and

applying it intelligently to create a competitive advantage. It

utilizes various sources of power to coordinate actions and

achieve coherent goals, illustrating that while diagnosing and

guiding policies are essential, effective implementation

through actionable steps is critical for success.


**Example**


Key Point:The importance of coherent action in

executing strategy successfully.


Example:Imagine you’re the manager of a bustling

coffee shop chain. You’ve identified that customer

satisfaction is declining due to slow service during peak

hours (diagnosis). Your guiding policy might focus on

improving operational efficiency through staff training

and better scheduling. Now, coherent actions could

involve conducting regular training sessions for baristas,

introducing a new system for order management, and

ensuring peak-time shifts are adequately staffed. Each

action aligns with your diagnosis and guiding policy to

ensure a significant improvement in service speed,

ultimately leading to happier customers and increased

sales.


**Critical Thinking**


Key Point:The concept of 'coherent actions' as

defined in this chapter is essential for strategy

implementation.


Critical Interpretation:While Rumelt posits that coherent

actions are vital for effective strategy, critics might

argue that flexibility and adaptability in actions should

also be prioritized. Situations can change rapidly, and a

rigid adherence to predefined actions without room for

adjustment could hinder an organization's ability to

respond to new challenges. This view aligns with

emergent strategy theories (Mintzberg, 1994) which

posit that strategies should evolve in response to

ongoing market dynamics, not solely rely on initial

coherence. Readers might consider this juxtaposition to

Rumelt's perspective.


## **Chapter 6 Summary : USING** **LEVERAGE**

**CHAPTER SIX**


**USING LEVERAGE**


A good strategy harnesses the power of focus, channeling

energy and action towards a pivotal objective to achieve

significant outcomes, termed as

**leverage**

. Strategic leverage is achieved through anticipation, insights

into critical situations, and concentrated effort.


**ANTICIPATION**

Effective strategists anticipate behaviors of others and

leverage this insight. For instance, investing in Manhattan

real estate is based on predicting future demand. Toyota’s

substantial investment in hybrid technologies stemmed from

anticipating fuel economy pressures and the automakers'


willingness to license their technology. Conversely, the U.S.

military's failure in Iraq was due in part to not anticipating

the insurgency's rise influenced by U.S. casualty media

coverage.

Modern examples of strategic anticipation include Pierre

Wack’s foresight regarding the OPEC oil crisis. He

recognized patterns in oil-producing countries’ populations

and ambitions, predicting price increases. His insights

cautioned against underestimating sudden market shifts,

highlighting that anticipating the behavior of others is key to

strategic success.

## **Chapter 7 Summary : PROXIMATE** **OBJECTIVES**

**CHAPTER SEVEN**


**PROXIMATE OBJECTIVES**


One of the most important tools leaders have is the creation

of proximate objectives—attainable targets close enough at

hand. A good example is President Kennedy’s goal to land a

man on the moon by the end of the 1960s, which was

strategically sound and possible due to existing technology.

Unlike more vague lofty goals, Kennedy identified concrete

steps to achieve success through resource allocation and

coordination.


**RESOLVING AMBIGUITY**


During Kennedy's moon mission, operational clarity was

crucial. At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Phyllis

Buwalda created a specification for the lunar surface,


addressing the high levels of uncertainty about the

environment. This strategic choice allowed the engineering

teams to focus on a solvable problem instead of being

paralyzed by ambiguity, ultimately leading to successful

missions.


**TAKING A STRONG POSITION AND**

**CREATING OPTIONS**


A strategy's effectiveness increases with clarity under

uncertainty. Leaders must recognize the limitations of

foresight during dynamic situations and focus on establishing

strong positions while creating future options. In a practical

example, a small business school clarified its objectives to

enhance student job placements, which opened numerous

pathways for success.


**HIERARCHIES OF OBJECTIVES**


Proximate objectives create a cascading effect throughout

organizations, where higher-level goals inform those of

lower levels, allowing for systematic problem-solving.

Differences in resources and skills dictate what is considered

proximate for various entities. Examples illustrate how


mastering essential competencies—and layering these

skills—enables organizations to focus on more complex

objectives, whether in academia or industry. Each step of

skill development enables organizations to tackle greater

challenges in their strategic pursuits.


**Example**


Key Point:Proximate objectives are essential for

guiding teams effectively towards larger goals.


Example:Imagine you are leading a project team aiming

to innovate a new product. Instead of stating a vague

ambition to 'improve customer satisfaction', you set a

clear proximate objective: 'Increase customer feedback

response rates by 30% within three months.' This

specific target not only provides a measurable

benchmark but also aligns the team's daily activities

towards achieving this goal. By breaking down the

larger vision into achievable, focused tasks, you create

clarity and motivate your team, ensuring they know

exactly what needs to be done in short time frames to

foster overall success in the project.


## **Chapter 8 Summary : CHAIN-LINK** **SYSTEMS**

**CHAPTER EIGHT CHAIN-LINK SYSTEMS**


A chain-link system's performance is determined by its

weakest component. Strengthening other components offers

no advantage if one link fails.


**Key Example: Challenger Disaster**


The tragic failure of the O-ring on the space shuttle

*Challenger* exemplifies the consequences of a weak link.

Despite advancements in other areas, the mission's failure is

attributed to this critical flaw. This principle applies broadly,

from construction to education, where quality cannot be

replaced by quantity.


**Identifying Limiting Factors**


When evaluating systems, it's crucial to identify limiting

factors that affect overall performance. For example, no


amount of expensive materials can compensate for external

noise near a property, much like poor quality in one area can

lessen the impact of excellence elsewhere.


**Getting Stuck: Management Challenges**


Complex systems often succumb to inertia where parts

function separately, hindering overall effectiveness. The

principle of quality matching suggests that improvements in

one area diminish returns if other links do not improve

alongside, leading to a lack of motivation to invest in

individual links.


**Chain-Link Issues in Organizations**


General Motors faced numerous intertwined issues where

enhancing one aspect did not translate to overall

improvement, mirroring challenges faced in broader

economic contexts. Interdependencies among various factors

hinder progress.


**Getting Unstuck: Leadership and Change**


Leadership is essential in unblocking chain-linked systems.


Marco Tinelli's leadership example illustrates that identifying

bottlenecks, tackling issues one by one, and prioritizing

quality can spark improvements. He emphasized quality first,

then sales, and finally cost management, resulting in a

successful turnaround.


**Excellence and Competitive Advantage: The IKEA**

**Model**


IKEA exemplifies how effectively managed chain-link

systems create competitive advantages. By integrating unique

policies and maintaining high standards across core

activities, IKEA has succeeded in establishing a model

difficult to replicate. Their combined operational efficiencies

create a strong defense against competitors.


**Strategic Takeaways**


To achieve sustained competitive excellence, leaders should

create integrated strategies composed of chain-linked

activities, ensuring high standards across all components.

When systems are poorly managed, like General Motors'

legacy challenges, incremental improvements alone are

insufficient; comprehensive, leader-driven change is required

to restore effectiveness.


## **Chapter 9 Summary : USING DESIGN**

**CHAPTER NINE**


**USING DESIGN**


The origin of the term "strategy" is rooted in military history,

but its application in business differs significantly.

Businesses compete not through destruction, but by

presenting attractive offers to customers. The larger a

company's size does not necessarily guarantee success;

rather, customer preference is a crucial factor. However,

military insights can still provide valuable business strategies

when approached carefully.


**THE FATHER OF STRATEGY**


Armies first emerged during the Bronze Age alongside urban

societies, leading to organized combat. A classic illustration

of strategic design is Hannibal's victory at Cannae, where he

effectively orchestrated combat movements leading to the

complete encirclement and defeat of a much larger Roman


force. Hannibal's strategy involved meticulous planning,

anticipation of enemy behavior, and the purposeful design of

coordinated troop actions, showcasing distinct elements

crucial to effective strategy.


**Premeditation**


Hannibal’s strategy at Cannae exemplified careful planning

rather than improvisation. Successful strategies balance prior

guidance with adaptation and improvisation.


**Anticipation**


**Design of Coordinated Action**



Hannibal's strategy was marked by an innovative

importance of design in military success. Modern strategic

thinking often involves designing responses to challenges

## **Chapter 10 Summary : FOCUS**

**CHAPTER TEN**


**FOCUS**


In this chapter, Richard P. Rumelt discusses a case study on

Crown Cork & Seal, a metal container manufacturer. The

main objectives of the session for executive MBAs are to

identify a company's strategy, enhance skills in analyzing

qualitative data, and explore the concept of "focus."


**Crown's Historical Performance**

- The strategy, established by John F. Connelly in the 1960s,

led to remarkable shareholder returns of 19% annually over

35 years.

- Many analysts oversimplified Crown's strategy, attributing

its success merely to its specialization in containers for

challenging products, thereby missing deeper insights.


**Industry Analysis**


- The case highlights a competitive environment where major

can manufacturers face low profit margins (4-5% return on

assets) due to fierce competition and operational challenges.

- Crown, however, outperformed these players significantly

by being 50-60% more profitable.


**Understanding Crown's Strategy**

- Initial opinions suggest Crown is a low-cost producer, but

further analysis reveals that its unit costs are likely higher

due to its focus on shorter production runs to meet specific

customer needs.


**Identifying Focus**

- The discussion progresses to differentiating policies like

technical assistance and rapid response, which are more

beneficial for smaller customers or those with urgent needs.

- The consensus emerges that Crown's focus on shorter runs

allows it to avoid being a captive producer, which enhances

its bargaining power.


**Competitive Advantage**


- By rigorously analyzing its policies, students learn that

Crown's strategy provides a competitive advantage by

aligning with the specific needs of targeted market segments.

- Crown’s approach contrasts with major competitors,

leading to increased profitability despite higher costs.


**Conclusion on Focus**

- Rumelt emphasizes that true strategy involves both the

coordination of distinct policies and aiming at the right

market targets.

- The surprise among students highlights the importance of

in-depth analysis in revealing the underlying logic of a

business's strategy, challenging the assumption that

successful companies always articulate their strategies

clearly.

- He concludes that many large organizations fail to focus

their efforts effectively, resulting in the pursuit of multiple

goals without achieving substantial progress in any.


**Example**


Key Point:The Importance of Strategic Focus for

Competitive Advantage


Example:Imagine you're leading a startup, aiming to

disrupt the tech industry. You have endless ideas and

potential products but quickly realize that scattering

your resources across all these options dilutes your

impact. Instead, you choose to focus on developing a

niche application that solves a specific problem for a

small group of users, understanding their unique needs

deeply. By concentrating your efforts on this one area,

you streamline your operations, enhance customer

satisfaction, and differentiate your product in the

market. Just like Crown Cork & Seal did with their

strategy, your focused approach gives you a significant

competitive advantage, enabling you to outperform

competitors who are still juggling multiple product lines

without a clear direction.


## **Chapter 11 Summary : GROWTH**

**CHAPTER ELEVEN**


**GROWTH**


In 1989, John Connelly transitioned leadership at Crown

Cork & Seal to William Avery due to health issues.

Connelly's death followed shortly after. Avery aimed to

ignite growth through acquisitions, addressing the company's

stagnation during the 1980s, aided by a team with acquisition

expertise.

Avery's strategy led to major acquisitions between 1990 and

1993, including Continental Can, Constar, Van Dorn, and

Tri-Valley Growers, doubling the size of Crown. In 1995,

Crown pursued CarnaudMetalBox, aiming for a global

foundation for growth. By 1997, with twenty acquisitions

completed, Crown became the largest container

manufacturer.

However, issues emerged in 1998. The boom in plastic

containers was unsustainable, resulting in market saturation

and declining sales. Moreover, Crown faced declining prices


in the metal can sector due to overcapacity and fierce

competition. This downturn caused a catastrophic drop in

stock prices from 1998 to 2001, leading to Avery's retirement

and the appointment of John Conway, who shifted focus

from growth to cost management and quality.

Despite rapid growth from 1990 to 2006, shareholder returns

fell sharply compared to previous years. The company's

profits also declined, highlighting the difference between

revenue growth and return on capital. Avery's

acquisition-heavy strategy neglected Crown's traditional

competitive advantages, as new entrants capitalized on

changing market dynamics.

Seeking expansion often leads to overvaluation in

acquisitions. Corporate leaders may pursue growth due to

misguided beliefs in cost reductions or larger payouts for

themselves, influenced by investment advisers eager for

lucrative fees.

The chapter discusses the future challenges

telecommunications company Telecom Italia faced,

including increased competition and deregulation. Their

proposed merger with Cable & Wireless was rife with

misguided rationales based on economies of scale without

adequate justification. Ultimately, healthy growth stems from

genuine demand for unique capabilities, innovation, and


efficiency rather than merely engineering growth through

acquisitions.


## **Chapter 12 Summary : USING** **ADVANTAGE**

**CHAPTER TWELVE USING ADVANTAGE**


**Understanding Advantage in Rivalry**

Advantage in competition comes from identifying and

leveraging asymmetries between rivals rather than from

equal skill levels. Successful leaders focus on exploiting

these critical differences to create significant advantages.


**WRESTLING THE GORILLA**


A start-up developing advanced textile materials initially

believed in their potential to build a great company.

However, venture capitalist Susan advised them to consider

licensing or selling the technology instead, highlighting the

danger of venturing into unfamiliar territory. Leaders should

recognize their advantages and avoid overextending into

areas where they are less equipped.

## **Chapter 13 Summary : USING** **DYNAMICS**

**CHAPTER THIRTEEN: USING DYNAMICS**


**Introduction to Strategy and High Ground**


In military strategy, holding high ground provides a natural

advantage for defense and makes it difficult for attackers. In

business strategy, the pursuit of economic high ground is

essential, yet the cost of obtaining such positions can be

prohibitive. Easy-to-capture positions tend to be transient and

can easily fall to competitors.


**Creating High Ground Through Innovation and**

**Change**


High ground can be established by innovation, as seen in

revolutionary products like Gore-Tex or FedEx’s overnight

delivery. Alternatively, businesses can seek opportunities by

riding waves of exogenous change, such as developments in


technology and market dynamics. Recognizing and adapting

to these shifts can help organizations navigate the evolving

landscape and build defensible positions.


**Historical Perspective on Change**


Many believe we live in an era of rapid change; however,

most industries experience stability most of the time. A

historical comparison of innovation from 1875 to 1925

illustrates far more profound and impactful changes than

those seen from 1942 to 1996, emphasizing the importance

of historical context in evaluating today's changes.


**Sensing Waves of Change**


Identifying waves of change early enables businesses to take

advantage of emerging opportunities. Understanding the

underlying forces at play during change is crucial, as

superficial observations often miss critical second-order

effects.


**Sensing the Wave’s Swell**


The case of Matra Communications in 1996 demonstrates the


challenges posed by change in telecommunications. While

recognizing the impending revolution in cellular telephony

and deregulation, Matra executives grapple with how

established players like Cisco surged ahead by leveraging

new technologies and market dynamics.


**Discerning the Fundamentals**


True understanding of change requires delving into details

and market shifts. The transition within telecommunications

in the 1990s illustrates the seismic shifts driven by software

innovation and the gradual breakdown of traditional vertical

structures.


**Software’s Competitive Advantage**


With millions of devices utilizing microprocessors, the

programming has become the key differentiator. The cost of

developing software is lower and more adaptable than

custom hardware, allowing quicker and more efficient

iteration, an advantage highlighted by the development of

Intel’s microprocessors.


**Why Computing Deconstructed**


The computer industry revolution transitioned from a

vertically integrated structure to a horizontal one, led by the

emergence of more intelligent components. Each segment

became independent and smart, easing systems integration

and spawning a myriad of specialized companies.


**Cisco Systems Rides the Wave**


Cisco's rapid ascent is attributed to capitalizing on several

waves of change, such as the rise of software and networking

needs. Their strategic decisions allowed them to dominate the

networking market despite competition from established

firms.


**Some Guideposts for Navigating Change**


1.

**Rising Fixed Costs:**

Increases in fixed costs often lead to industry consolidation

as only larger firms can absorb these costs.

2.

**Deregulation:**

Major policy shifts can radically alter the competitive


landscape and operational dynamics of industries.

3.

**Predictable Biases:**

Forecasting often fails to predict peak demand and industry

convergence, leading to misguided strategies.

4.

**Incumbent Response:**

Established firms typically resist changes that could

undermine their advantages, often leading to inertia.

5.

**Attractor States:**

Understanding industry dynamics helps leaders position

themselves towards a more efficient operational model, as

illustrated by Cisco's IP-centric vision.


**Conclusion**


Navigating change requires a deeper understanding of

underlying dynamics, industry trends, and the associated

risks. With clear observations and strategic acuity,

organizations can better position themselves to respond to

disruptive forces and capitalize on emerging opportunities.


## **Chapter 14 Summary : INERTIA AND** **ENTROPY**

**CHAPTER FOURTEEN**


**INERTIA AND ENTROPY**


In business, inertia refers to an organization’s reluctance or

inability to adjust to changes in its environment, while

entropy signifies the tendency of weakly managed

organizations to become disorderly over time. Leaders must

consistently strive to maintain their organization's focus and

structure, especially in static circumstances.


**Implications for Strategy**



**Rival Inertia**

: Successful strategies often capitalize on the inertia of

competitors.



**Internal Challenges**

: Organizational renewal is critical when faced with entropy

and inertia, necessitating comprehensive strategies to change

established routines, culture, and power dynamics.


**INERTIA**


Inertia can be classified into three forms:


**The Inertia of Routine**


- Organizations develop standard procedures that limit their

responsiveness to significant changes. Unexpected shocks

can unveil this inertia.


**The Inertia of Culture**


- Cultural inertia within organizations, such as AT&T, where

lack of product development capability stifled innovation,

can inhibit rapid adaptation to new market realities. Cultural

changes are more challenging and require simplifying and

restructuring processes.


**Inertia by Proxy**


- Firms might not respond to market changes when their

existing profit streams are still strong due to customer inertia.

This strategy can blind firms to emerging competition and

market shifts.


**ENTROPY**


Entropy often manifests as disorder within a firm. It can lead

to blurred product lines and less focus on organizational

goals.


**Examples of Entropy in Action**


- The case of Denton’s illustrates how systematic

management and the elimination of inefficiencies can restore

focus and enhance profitability.

- In contrast, General Motors demonstrated how a lack of

management over time led to product line confusion and

ultimately contributed to corporate decline and bankruptcy.

Effective management is vital; without it, the decay of

structure and order can lead to significant organizational

struggles.

In summary, addressing both inertia and entropy requires


active management and strategic foresight to navigate and

counteract these challenges effectively.


## **Chapter 15 Summary : PUTTING IT** **TOGETHER**

**CHAPTER FIFTEEN**


**PUTTING IT TOGETHER**


Nvidia, a designer of 3-D graphics chips, achieved rapid

dominance in the high-performance 3-D graphics chip

market, surpassing giants like Intel. Forbes recognized

Nvidia as the "Company of the Year" in 2007, noting a

remarkable 21-fold increase in shares since its IPO in 1999.

Nvidia’s success stemmed from a good strategy characterized

by a diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent action,

underscoring the importance of anticipation, simplicity,

design, focus, and taking advantage of competitors' disarray.


**3-D GRAPHICS, UTAH, AND SGI**


3-D graphics technology allows dynamic visualization in

computer-generated environments, rooted in research from


the University of Utah. Pioneers like Jim Clark established

Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) to create high-resolution graphics

workstations and develop significant graphics standards, such

as the graphics pipeline used in films like *Jurassic Park*.


**GAMERS**


By the early 1990s, the gaming market catalyzed the demand

for 3-D graphics capabilities in personal computers, driven

by the popularity of action games like *Doom* and

*Quake*, which showcased real-time rendering. The success

of PC gaming revealed the necessity for high-performance



product but pivoted strategy after facing competition from

3dfx. Marked by a focus on 3-D graphics, Nvidia adopted the

## **Chapter 16 Summary : THE SCIENCE** **OF STRATEGY**

**CHAPTER SIXTEEN**


**THE SCIENCE OF STRATEGY**


Good strategy is founded on functional knowledge about

effectiveness and the reasons behind certain actions. While

available knowledge is important, proprietary knowledge

unique to an organization is invaluable.

Organizations cultivate proprietary knowledge through a

method called *scientific empiricism*, which allows for the

generation of knowledge as new strategies are implemented

and tested. A new strategy is essentially a hypothesis that is

tested through real-world experimentation, leading to

iterative adjustments based on outcomes.


**STRATEGY IS A HYPOTHESIS**


In the context of developing strategies for Hughes


Electronics, a disconnect emerges between engineering

precision and business ambiguity. Managers desire a clear

way to predict the outcomes of different strategies, reflecting

their engineering background in which certainty is

paramount. The concept of strategy as a hypothesis allows

for experimentation and adaptation based on learned

outcomes, similar to scientific inquiry.

A well-founded strategy is not merely speculative; it is

developed through educated judgments, reflecting both the

collective knowledge of the organization and the dynamic

nature of competition.


**ENLIGHTENMENT AND SCIENCE**


In times of stability, maintaining the status quo might suffice,

but true strategy requires an innovative edge particularly in a

changing environment. A focus solely on deduction ignores

opportunities for creative solutions and innovation. Historical

context reveals that the Enlightenment reinvigorated inquiry

and skepticism about assumed knowledge, which parallels

the need for a questioning approach in strategic business

decisions.


**ANOMALIES**


Anomalies represent opportunities for learning and growth,

challenging established norms. Scientific progress often

relies on recognizing and exploring these anomalies, leading

to breakthroughs in understanding.


**ESPRESSO ANOMALY**


Howard Schultz's experience in Italy exposed him to the

vibrant culture of espresso bars, which struck him as an

anomaly compared to the American coffee culture. He

hypothesized that this experience could be successfully

introduced in America, leading to the founding of Starbucks.


**COFFEE DIVERGENCE**


American coffee culture historically diverged from European

traditions, evolving into a mass-market commodity rather

than a premium product. Schultz faced the challenge of

reconciling this divergent history with his vision of elevating

coffee consumption in America through an Italian-style café

experience.


**TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS**


Schultz's journey exemplified the iterative process of

hypothesis testing. He launched *Il Giornale*, a direct

interpretation of the Italian espresso bar, learning and

adapting based on customer feedback to create a successful

coffee business.


**CAPTURING PROPRIETARY INFORMATION**


Starbucks' integration of coffee roasting, branding, and

retailing allowed for the capture of proprietary information

and enhanced learning opportunities across its operations.

This vertical integration facilitated the mutual adjustment of

various business components, an essential strategy for

maintaining a competitive edge in the market.

In conclusion, the strategic process involves embracing

creativity, testing hypotheses, and learning from anomalies,

which are crucial for fostering innovation and capturing

unique market insights.


## **Chapter 17 Summary : USING YOUR** **HEAD**

**CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: USING YOUR HEAD**


**Introduction**


At twenty-five, the author shares his nervousness as a

doctoral student at Harvard, tasked with interviewing a senior

manager about strategy. He recounts his conversation with

Fred Fletcher, general manager of Fansteel Inc.’s Advanced

Structures division, who underscores the importance of

discussing strategy with someone outside of his usual

corporate interactions.


**The Value of Reflection**


The author reflects on a lunch conversation fifteen years

later, relating a story about Andrew Carnegie and Frederick

Taylor. Taylor’s advice to Carnegie—to create a list of the

ten most important things to do—teaches that the act of


reflection is vital for decision-making, emphasizing how

busy professionals often lose sight of their larger purposes

amid immediate demands.


**Cognitive Limitations in Strategy**


Cognitive limitations can hinder strategic thinking. The

author emphasizes that being strategic is about overcoming

myopia, allowing for a broader perspective, and recognizing

issues often overlooked by others. Effective strategists

perceive what others miss, ensuring that insights are based on

reality rather than assumptions.


**Group Dynamics in Strategy**


In a workshop focused on TiVo’s strategy, the author notes

how participants often latch onto their first insights without

deeply analyzing alternatives. He encourages them to

introspect on how they arrived at their conclusions rather

than simply sharing them. This approach highlights the

importance of critically assessing one’s judgments.


**Trusting Instincts vs. Critical Thinking**


Participants present varied responses to TiVo's challenges,

but most relied on initial hunches. The author points out that

while quick judgments can be effective, complex strategic

decisions often require deeper analysis rather than defaulting

to instinctual reactions. He advocates for revisiting

judgments and generating alternative views.


**Overcoming Quick Closure**


The discomfort with complex issues leads to a tendency for

quick closure around initial ideas. The author explains that

this can prevent the discovery of better alternatives. He

suggests techniques for generating robust strategies,

recommending a focus on identifying obstacles and

re-evaluating initial insights through structured questioning.


**Techniques for Strategic Thinking**


To combat cognitive biases, the author presents several

techniques:


**The Kernel**

: A framework consisting of diagnosis, guiding policy, and

coherent actions. This ensures a comprehensive strategy.


**Problem-Solution**

: Transitioning from what is being done to why, leading to

more effective strategies.


**Create-Destroy**

: A discipline where one actively critiques their own ideas to

foster the development of new alternatives.


**Building a Panel of Experts**


The author recommends creating a mental panel of experts to

critique ideas and stimulate new insights. This personalized

approach combines unique perspectives, ultimately

enhancing the decision-making process.


**Practicing Judgment**


Good judgment is portrayed as a skill that can be developed

through practice and reflection. By committing judgments to

writing, individuals can revisit and critique their own

reasoning, leading to improved strategic insights over time.


**Conclusion**


The chapter emphasizes that strategic thinking involves

overcoming cognitive limitations, recognizing the

importance of reflection, and practicing critical judgment. It

advocates for structured techniques to foster deeper insights,

ensuring effective strategy formulation.


## **Chapter 18 Summary : KEEPING** **YOUR HEAD**

**CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: KEEPING YOUR HEAD**


*Summary of Insights*

Good strategy arises from an individual, careful assessment

of situations, while bad strategy tends to follow popular

trends, often neglecting foundational insights. This chapter

explores the challenges of maintaining independent thought

in strategic decision-making, illustrated through two stories:

Global Crossing and the financial crisis of 2008.


**GLOBAL CROSSING**


Global Crossing aimed to revolutionize transatlantic

communication with its innovative cable technology. Despite

its initial success and significant valuation in the stock

market, the company was ultimately a product of industry

fundamentals being ignored.

- The late 1990s saw a huge surge in telecommunications

investment, with projections of continuous growth in internet


traffic feeding optimism around firms like Global Crossing.

- However, the market failed to account for significant

economic realities such as overcapacity and declining prices

due to increased competition.

- A detailed analysis by MBA students highlighted the

concerning industry structure dominated by undifferentiated

commodities and price sensitivity.

- The eventual bankruptcy of Global Crossing was

underscored by a lack of sustainable profit and a realignment

of expectations, marking a major lesson on the dangers of

herd mentality in investment.



confidence faltered.

- Key contributors to the crisis included:

1. Engineering overreach with untested financial products.

only that of the electrical power required—essentially zero.


4.To judge their truth one must look beyond the system to


outside knowledge.


5.When we don’t know about something, it may be sensible


to look at the behavior of others, assuming that at least


some of them know things that we do not. But if everyone


else is doing the same, then this process of mutual


calibration can result in all the members of a group


undertaking uninformed actions or believing that the 'other


guy' is paying attention to fundamentals.


6.It is important to push back against these biases. You can


do this by paying attention to real-world data that refutes


the echo-chamber chanting of the crowd—and by learning


the lessons taught by history and by other people in other

## **Good Strategy Bad Strategy Questions**

[View on Bookey Website](https://www.bookey.app/book/good-strategy%2C-bad-strategy/qa?utm_source=bookey-pdf)

#### **Chapter 1 | GOOD STRATEGY IS UNEXPECTED|** **Q&A**


**1.Question**


**What is the significance of a good strategy being**


**‘unexpected’?**

Answer:Good strategy is often unexpected because


many organizations are not prepared for coherent


and focused plans. They tend to have disjointed


goals and initiatives, relying on superficial efforts


rather than strategic depth. This allows


organizations with good strategies to gain a


competitive edge; they do things that their


competitors do not expect.


**2.Question**


**How did Steve Jobs manage to turn Apple around when**


**most did not expect success?**

Answer:Jobs focused on simplifying Apple's product line,


cutting unnecessary models and streamlining operations.


Instead of making ambitious revenue goals, he concentrated


on identifying and resolving the fundamental problems


facing the company. This unexpected return to basics—rather


than expansion—caught most industry observers off guard.


**3.Question**


**What was the 'left hook' strategy in the Gulf War, and**


**why was it surprising?**

Answer:General Schwarzkopf’s 'left hook' strategy involved


a secretive maneuvering of troops to outflank Iraqi forces, in


response to the anticipation of a direct attack. This was


surprising because many assumed that military operations


would follow traditional methods, and the intelligence


community underestimated the coalition's capacity for


tactical innovation.


**4.Question**


**Why do complex organizations fail to implement focused**


**strategies?**

Answer:Complex organizations often spread their resources


too thin, trying to accommodate various internal and external


pressures. Hence, they might produce a laundry list of goals


rather than a coherent strategy. Good strategy requires


leaders to prioritize and sometimes say no to competing


interests, which is often difficult to achieve in large


bureaucracies.


**5.Question**


**How does the example of Apple reflect on the nature of**


**leadership in developing good strategies?**

Answer:The Apple case illustrates that effective leadership


involves deep understanding of market realities and the


courage to make tough decisions regarding the company’s


focus. Jobs’s decisions were driven by clarity of purpose,


showcasing that successful strategic leaders not only know


what to pursue but also what to reject to enable a clear path


forward.


**6.Question**


**What lesson can be gleaned about strategy from the**


**responses of business leaders during interviews?**

Answer:Many leaders recognized the successful strategies of


competitors but did not emulate this focus in their own


approaches. This highlights a common disconnect in business


management where understanding effective strategy does not


translate into action, underscoring the importance of coherent


execution over mere acknowledgment of best practices.


**7.Question**


**How does good strategy relate to the capacity to identify**


**new opportunities?**

Answer:Good strategy is often characterized by the ability to


recognize and exploit emerging opportunities when they


arise, but it also requires patience and insight to wait for the


right moment to act—much like Jobs’s philosophy of


‘waiting for the next big thing.’ This contrasts with a


constant push for growth without strategic foresight.

#### **Chapter 2 | DISCOVERING POWER| Q&A**


**1.Question**


**What does David's victory over Goliath teach us about**


**perceived strengths and weaknesses in strategy?**

Answer:The story illustrates that preconceived


notions of strength, like Goliath's size and armor,


can be misleading. David's experience with his sling


and his speed were key advantages that enabled him


to defeat Goliath. This highlights that true strength


may lie in recognizing and leveraging unique


insights into a situation rather than simply relying


on conventional wisdom or apparent strengths.


**2.Question**


**How did Sam Walton break conventional wisdom with**


**Wal-Mart's strategy?**

Answer:Sam Walton defied the belief that a full-line discount


store required a large population base by placing Wal-Mart


stores in small towns. He focused on everyday low prices and


implemented a highly efficient logistics system, revealing


that the network of stores and their interconnections were


more crucial than the individual stores' solitary economics.


**3.Question**


**Why is it important to consider competitors when**


**analyzing a successful company like Wal-Mart?**


Answer:Focusing solely on a winning firm's strategies


without considering its competitors gives an incomplete


picture. Wal-Mart's ability to exploit Kmart's failures—its


slower adaptation and decentralized structure—played a vital


role in its dominance. Understanding competitive dynamics


reveals hidden power in a company's strategies.


**4.Question**


**What subtle shift did Andy Marshall propose for U.S.**


**defense strategy during the Cold War?**

Answer:Marshall suggested a fundamental change from a


reactive stance focused on assessing Soviet military


capabilities to a proactive approach that leveraged U.S.


strengths to exploit Soviet weaknesses. Instead of merely


reacting to threats, the aim was to impose high costs on the


Soviet Union, demonstrating the power of strategic foresight.


**5.Question**


**What can businesses learn from Wal-Mart's integrated**


**network approach?**

Answer:Businesses can understand that merely copying


successful strategies piecemeal is insufficient; instead, they


must adopt a comprehensive design where all


aspects—location, logistics, pricing—work in harmony. This


holistic perspective can create a competitive edge that is not


easily replicated.


**6.Question**


**How does the narrative of David and Goliath relate to**


**discovering hidden strengths in business strategy?**

Answer:David's story exemplifies how unconventional


thinking can reveal hidden advantages. By focusing on


agility and precision rather than brute strength, one can find


ways to leverage apparent weaknesses in others. In business,


this often means identifying unique capabilities or insights


that competitors overlook.


**7.Question**


**What lesson does the contrast between Wal-Mart and**


**Kmart illustrate about organizational structure in**


**business?**

Answer:The contrast shows that a well-integrated


organizational structure can be a significant advantage.


Kmart's decentralized approach led to coordination problems


and missed opportunities, while Wal-Mart's networked


system allowed for efficient resource sharing and quicker


innovation, demonstrating that coherence in strategy can


trump size advantage.


**8.Question**


**What key insight does Andrew Marshall’s analysis**


**provide for developing competitive strategy?**

Answer:Marshall's insight emphasizes the importance of


viewing competition through the lens of relative strengths


and weaknesses rather than simply focusing on direct


capabilities. The key is to find ways to impose asymmetric


costs on competitors, which can create sustainable


advantages in competitive environments.

#### **Chapter 3 | BAD STRATEGY| Q&A**


**1.Question**


**What are the key indicators of bad strategy?**

Answer:The four major hallmarks of bad strategy


are: 1) Fluff, which is superfluous language that


obscures a lack of substance; 2) Failure to face the


challenge, meaning the inability to accurately


identify or define the actual problems faced; 3)


Mistaking goals for strategy, where aspirations are


confused with actionable plans; and 4) Bad strategic


objectives that fail to address critical issues or are


impractical.


**2.Question**


**How does bad strategy manifest in corporate settings?**

Answer:In corporate settings, bad strategy often appears as


vague goals without concrete plans or actions to achieve


them. For instance, a company may state it wants to be


'customer-centric' without outlining specific strategies to


enhance customer service or meet customer needs.


**3.Question**


**What's an example of 'fluff' from the text?**

Answer:An example of fluff is a retail bank's internal memo


stating, 'Our fundamental strategy is one of customer-centric


intermediation.' This uses inflated language to say simply


that the bank is a bank, revealing superficial thinking.


**4.Question**


**Why is it critical to face challenges head-on in strategy**


**formulation?**

Answer:Facing challenges head-on is critical because if


organizations fail to identify and analyze the problems they


face, they cannot develop effective strategies to overcome


them. This is exemplified by International Harvester's failure


to address the underlying issues in its operations, leading to


its decline despite superficial strategic plans.


**5.Question**


**How can strategic objectives differ from mere goals?**

Answer:Strategic objectives must be actionable and specific,


defining measurable steps towards achieving broader goals.


For example, rather than stating a goal to grow profits, a


company might set an objective to reduce operational costs


by a certain percentage within a year.


**6.Question**


**What cautionary tale does the author share regarding**


**motivation in strategy?**


Answer:The author compares the reliance on motivation to a


historical military campaign, highlighting how merely


pushing for effort without a sound strategy leads to


disastrous outcomes, as seen in the high casualty rates at the


exaggeratedly ambitious battles of World War I.


**7.Question**


**What underlying issue did the Author point out about the**


**LAUSD’s approach to improving schools?**

Answer:The LAUSD's approach did not adequately address


the root causes of underperformance in schools,


acknowledging merely the need for improvement without


tackling systemic issues like poverty and community


instability that were undermining student success.


**8.Question**


**What should effective strategic planning focus on instead**


**of vague aspirations?**

Answer:Effective strategic planning should focus on


identifying specific obstacles to progress and developing


actionable plans to overcome them, rather than simply listing


broad goals or desired outcomes without clear pathways to


achievement.


**9.Question**


**Can you provide an analogy to clarify the importance of**


**actionable strategies?**

Answer:An effective strategy is like a lever: it magnifies


effort. Attempting to achieve results through sheer willpower


is akin to trying to lift a boulder with brute strength alone;


without the right tools and insights, the effort will likely be


futile.


**10.Question**


**What ultimate lesson can be drawn about crafting**


**strategies?**

Answer:The ultimate lesson is that good strategy is rooted in


realistic analysis and clear paths to action, focusing on


overcoming actual challenges rather than getting lost in


rhetoric, vague goals, or misguided optimism.


#### **Chapter 4 | WHY SO MUCH BAD STRATEGY?|** **Q&A**

**1.Question**


**Why is bad strategy so common in organizations despite**


**the widespread recognition of its importance?**

Answer:Bad strategy is often not due to


miscalculation but rather due to an active avoidance


of making hard choices. This avoidance stems from


the pain or difficulty leaders face when having to


prioritize competing values, leading to vague and


ineffective strategies that lack focus.


**2.Question**


**What determines the effectiveness of a strategy?**

Answer:A strategy is effective only when it requires making


clear, tough choices about what to pursue and what to set


aside. Without these difficult decisions, organizations often


settle for vague goals that do not provide real direction.


**3.Question**


**Can you explain Condorcet's paradox in the context of**


**strategic decision-making?**


Answer:Condorcet's paradox arises in situations where cyclic


preferences exist among choices, making it difficult to


achieve a stable majority decision. In DEC's case, executives


couldn't arrive at a coherent strategy because their conflicting


preferences resulted in a situation where no definitive choice


was made.


**4.Question**


**What are the three common pathways leading to bad**


**strategy, according to the text?**

Answer:The three pathways leading to bad strategy are: 1)


Unwillingness or inability to choose, leading to vague


strategies. 2) Relying on template-style strategies that fill in


the blanks without deep analysis. 3) Adopting a 'New


Thought' mindset that emphasizes positive thinking over


practical strategy.


**5.Question**


**How did Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)**


**exemplify the consequences of bad strategy?**

Answer:DEC faced a critical turning point but failed to make


necessary strategic choices among competing visions for the


company. As a result, they ended up with a non-strategy


statement that reflected compromise rather than a clear


direction, which ultimately contributed to the organization's


decline.


**6.Question**


**What lesson does the anecdote about Intel’s shift from**


**memories to microprocessors teach about strategy?**

Answer:Intel's successful transition illustrates that making


difficult strategic decisions—such as abandoning a


historically significant product line—can lead to a successful


realignment of the company's focus. Such transformations


require strong leadership and the courage to prioritize future


interests over the past.


**7.Question**


**How do template-style strategies contribute to bad**


**strategy?**

Answer:Template-style strategies often lead to vague


statements of vision, mission, and values that lack actionable


elements. They substitute thoughtful analysis with


generalized slogans, resulting in a lack of clear direction or


meaningful choice, which ultimately fails to address real


challenges.


**8.Question**


**What impact does the inability to make choices have on**


**organizational strategy?**

Answer:The inability to make choices leads to a diffusion of


focus and energy, resulting in ambiguous goals that everyone


can agree on but that lack true strategic depth. This often


indicates a failure of leadership to assert direction and make


tough calls.


**9.Question**


**Why does the text criticize the New Thought approach to**


**strategy?**

Answer:The text criticizes New Thought for promoting the


idea that positive thinking alone can achieve success, which


neglects critical analysis and the necessity of addressing


potential obstacles. This mindset can displace genuine


strategic planning, leading to ineffective outcomes.


**10.Question**


**In what way did Eisenhower's strategy differ from mere**


**visionary leadership?**

Answer:Eisenhower's approach involved making tough


choices based on a thorough assessment of risks and


alternatives rather than merely relying on a charismatic


vision. He prioritized realpolitik over aspirational goals,


demonstrating that successful strategy requires a balance of


vision and practical decision-making.

#### **Chapter 5 | THE KERNEL OF GOOD STRATEGY|** **Q&A**


**1.Question**


**What is the kernel of a good strategy according to**


**Rumelt?**

Answer:The kernel of a good strategy consists of


three elements: 1. A diagnosis that defines the


nature of the challenge. 2. A guiding policy for


addressing that challenge. 3. A set of coherent


actions designed to implement the guiding policy.


**2.Question**


**Why is diagnosis important in strategy formulation?**

Answer:Diagnosis simplifies complexity by identifying


critical aspects of a situation, allowing strategists to


understand what is truly going on, which guides subsequent


decisions and actions.


**3.Question**


**How does a guiding policy differ from a strategic vision**


**or goal?**

Answer:A guiding policy provides a method for coping with


a challenge and channels action in specific directions, while a


vision or goal does not specify how those ends will be


achieved.


**4.Question**


**What example does Rumelt use to explain the concept of**


**coherent actions?**

Answer:Rumelt illustrates coherent actions through the


example of Starbucks diagnosing its challenges and deciding


on coordinated actions that align with its guiding policy for


customer solutions.


**5.Question**


**How can a diagnosis transform strategic options?**

Answer:An insightful diagnosis allows organizations to


reframe their approach to challenges and opens up new


avenues for action by identifying the most relevant issues to


address.


**6.Question**


**What lesson about organizational change can be gleaned**


**from the case of Lou Gerstner at IBM?**

Answer:Gerstner's turnaround strategy involved changing the


diagnosis of IBM's problems, recognizing that instead of


needing fragmentation, they required leveraging their


integrated capabilities to provide tailored customer solutions.


**7.Question**


**In what way does coherence in action contribute to**


**strategic advantage?**

Answer:Coherence in action creates synergy across


initiatives, ensuring that efforts do not conflict but rather


support each other, which enhances overall effectiveness and


efficiency.


**8.Question**


**What does Rumelt imply about the relationship between**


**organization and strategy?**

Answer:Rumelt suggests that a good strategy not only


identifies what needs to be done but also dictates how to


organize efforts effectively to implement those actions.


**9.Question**


**How does Rumelt use the example of World War II to**


**illustrate strategic coordination?**

Answer:He illustrates that successful wartime strategies


involved centralized coordination of military and economic


efforts, which could not have been effectively managed


through decentralized decision-making.


**10.Question**


**What is the ultimate takeaway regarding good strategy**


**from Chapter 5?**

Answer:Good strategy hinges on a clear diagnosis, a guiding


policy that supports coherent actions, and the ability to make


tough prioritization choices to focus on what truly matters.

#### **Chapter 6 | USING LEVERAGE| Q&A**


**1.Question**


**What is strategic leverage and why is it important?**

Answer:Strategic leverage involves focusing minds,


energy, and efforts on a pivotal objective, which can


produce a cascade of favorable outcomes. Its


importance lies in the ability to channel resources


effectively to magnify the impact of actions, just as a


lever magnifies force. By identifying crucial pivot


points and applying focused effort, an organization


can achieve disproportionately large results with


relatively small adjustments.


**2.Question**


**How can anticipation play a role in developing a good**


**strategy?**

Answer:Anticipation involves understanding and predicting


others' behaviors and broader trends that can be leveraged to


gain an advantage. For example, Toyota's investment in


hybrid technology during the SUV boom was based on the


anticipation of rising fuel economy pressures and competitor


hesitance to innovate. This foresight allowed Toyota to


position itself successfully in the market.


**3.Question**


**What defines a 'pivot point' in strategic planning?**

Answer:A pivot point is an area of strategic focus that can


magnify the effect of concentrated efforts, often arising from


imbalances or unmet demands in the market or environment.


Identifying these points enables strategists to allocate


resources effectively where they will produce the largest


impact, like 7-Eleven's approach to catering to localized


tastes in Japan.


**4.Question**


**How does the concept of concentration enhance strategic**


**effectiveness?**

Answer:Concentration amplifies strategic effectiveness by


focusing resources on fewer, critical objectives rather than


spreading them thinly. This creates larger payoffs by


overcoming threshold effects, where only a significant level


of effort yields visible outcomes. For instance, instead of


aiming to improve many underperforming schools slightly,


focusing resources on turning around just two schools can


have a more impactful effect on public perception.


**5.Question**


**Can you illustrate the consequences of failing to**


**anticipate strategic outcomes?**

Answer:The U.S. military's invasion plan for Iraq in 2003


serves as a cautionary tale. It did not anticipate the


emergence of a strong insurgency, leading to a prolonged


conflict and high casualties. This failure stemmed from


misjudging both the post-Saddam landscape and the Iraqi


insurgents' strategy, resulting in an unprepared military and


extensive operational setbacks.


**6.Question**


**Why is the Getty Trust's strategy under Harold Williams**


**significant?**

Answer:Harold Williams' strategy for the Getty Trust was


significant because it moved beyond simply acquiring art.


Instead, he aimed to revolutionize how art is studied and


preserved, investing in educational programs, conservation


efforts, and a comprehensive digital catalog of artworks. This


approach not only created a lasting impact in the art


community but also aligned perfectly with the trust's


substantial resources, demonstrating the power of strategic


concentration.


**7.Question**


**How did Reagan's speech at the Brandenburg Gate**


**exemplify a successful use of strategic pivot points?**

Answer:Reagan's speech highlighted the imbalance between


the freedoms enjoyed by Westerners and the restrictions


placed on Eastern Europeans. By calling for Gorbachev to


'tear down this wall,' he effectively used the pivot point of


perceived liberalization versus reality, thereby leveraging


public sentiment and reinforcing the ideological divide,


which contributed to the eventual fall of the Berlin Wall.


#### **Chapter 7 | PROXIMATE OBJECTIVES| Q&A**

**1.Question**


**What is a proximate objective, and why is it important**


**for an organization?**

Answer:A proximate objective is a clear and


achievable goal that an organization can aim for in


the near term. It is important because it provides


focus, direction, and a sense of feasibility, allowing


an organization to mobilize resources effectively and


make progress. For instance, President Kennedy's


goal of landing a man on the moon was a proximate


objective that united resources and efforts toward a


clear target.


**2.Question**


**How did Kennedy’s moon landing objective illustrate the**


**power of proximate objectives?**

Answer:Kennedy’s moon landing objective was a bold, yet


well-defined plan that considered the realities of


technological capabilities and political context. It was


feasible because it leveraged existing technologies and


scientific expertise, turning an ambitious vision into


actionable steps, which inspired organizational energy and


effort toward a shared goal.


**3.Question**


**Why is resolving ambiguity critical in setting proximate**


**objectives?**

Answer:Resolving ambiguity is crucial because it allows


organizations to define clear parameters within which they


can operate. By addressing uncertainties, leaders provide


actionable specifications that enable teams to strategize


effectively. For example, when Phyllis Buwalda created a


lunar surface model for the Surveyor project, she helped


engineers focus on a solvable problem rather than getting lost


in the unknowns.


**4.Question**


**What lesson can we learn about ambition from the**


**discussion of proximate objectives and the War on**


**Drugs?**

Answer:The War on Drugs exemplifies the danger of


ambitious goals that lack feasible paths to achievement. It


highlights that while objectives may be noble, without a


realistic framework for action, they can lead to further


complications rather than progress. Realistic proximate


objectives are essential for effective problem-solving and


achieving meaningful outcomes.


**5.Question**


**How does the concept of 'taking a strong position and**


**creating options' relate to dynamic situations?**

Answer:In dynamic situations, leaders should focus on


establishing a strong position and creating options rather than


trying to predict the distant future. This involves making


moves that enhance flexibility and adaptability, similar to


chess players improving their positioning to prepare for


emerging opportunities and threats.


**6.Question**


**What insight can be gained from PJ's discussion on**


**helicopter piloting regarding skill development and**


**concentration?**

Answer:PJ’s discussion emphasizes that foundational skills


must be mastered before higher-level tasks become feasible.


In organizational contexts, this means leaders must ensure


that basic competencies are established before expecting


teams to tackle more complex challenges, highlighting the


importance of layering skills to facilitate concentration on


strategic objectives.


**7.Question**


**How do proximate objectives cascade in organizations,**


**and what implications does this have?**

Answer:Proximate objectives cascade down hierarchical


structures, creating specific goals at various levels that


contribute to the overall mission. This cascading effect


allows for detailed problem-solving at all levels and ensures


alignment with strategic aims. For example, a high-level goal


like improving student job placement can spawn specific


initiatives in departments focused on developing partnerships


with target employers.


**8.Question**


**In what way does the moon landing mission showcase**


**strategic clarity amid complexity?**


Answer:The Apollo moon landing exemplified strategic


clarity as it clearly defined a specific objective that the


organization could pursue despite the complexities of space


travel. By setting feasible milestones and a clear vision


rooted in technical capabilities, it focused efforts and inspired


collective action, demonstrating how clarity can drive


success in challenging environments.

#### **Chapter 8 | CHAIN-LINK SYSTEMS| Q&A**


**1.Question**


**What is the chain-link logic and how does it affect system**


**performance?**

Answer:Chain-link logic refers to the principle that


the overall performance of a system is determined


by its weakest link. In such systems, merely


improving strong links cannot compensate for a


weak link; all links must function effectively for


optimal performance. For example, in the case of the


Challenger shuttle disaster, the failure of the O-ring


led to the destruction of the shuttle, demonstrating


how crucial each component's reliability is. Effective


management must identify and strengthen weak


links to prevent systemic failure.


**2.Question**


**How can organizations avoid getting stuck in**


**low-effectiveness states?**

Answer:Organizations can avoid getting stuck by examining


their chain-link systems critically, identifying bottlenecks,


and addressing them systematically. Leadership plays a


crucial role; leaders should not only focus on immediate


profitability but should also invest in necessary


improvements across all linked components, as demonstrated


by Marco Tinelli's approach in turning around his machinery


company. By focusing on quality first, followed by


enhancing the sales force, and finally reducing costs, he was


able to improve the overall effectiveness of the organization.


**3.Question**


**What lessons can be learned from Marco Tinelli's**


**turnaround strategy?**


Answer:Marco Tinelli's strategy teaches us the importance of


sequentially addressing systemic weaknesses rather than


seeking quick fixes. His method highlights the need for


strong leadership that prioritizes quality and long-term goals


over short-term profits. By reframing organizational


objectives and ensuring each link in the chain becomes


stronger collectively, organizations can achieve sustainable


success. His experience illustrates that real change may


require absorbing short-term costs for long-term gains.


**4.Question**


**In what ways does IKEA exemplify the concept of**


**chain-linked systems?**

Answer:IKEA exemplifies chain-linked systems through its


unique integration of multiple activities, including design,


manufacturing, retail, and logistics. Each core activity is


interdependent, meaning that competitors cannot simply


adopt any one aspect without overhauling their entire


strategy to match IKEA's level of quality and coordination.


This creates a formidable competitive advantage, making it


difficult for rivals to replicate IKEA’s success without


significant foundational changes.


**5.Question**


**Why is it challenging for competitors to replicate IKEA's**


**model?**

Answer:Competitors find it challenging to replicate IKEA's


model because the effectiveness of its strategy rests on the


seamless integration and interdependence of its chain-linked


activities. Success in one area, like ready-to-assemble


products, does not automatically confer success in another,


like logistics or retail design. This complexity requires a


distinct mix of resources and skills that is not easily


duplicated, thus ensuring IKEA's sustained competitive edge.


**6.Question**


**What role does identifying limiting factors play in**


**strategic investment?**

Answer:Identifying limiting factors is crucial in strategic


investment because it allows organizations to allocate


resources effectively where they will have the most impact.


For instance, a home remodeling project might be hindered


by factors like location noise rather than poor materials. By


focusing on improving aspects that can be fixed, businesses


can enhance overall performance and value. Knowing where


the limits lie enables leaders to prioritize investments that


remove barriers to success.


**7.Question**


**How does chain-link logic apply to both excellence and**


**systemic failure in organizations?**

Answer:Chain-link logic illustrates that organizations can


either excel or become stuck based on the quality and


effectiveness of their interrelated activities. When all


components perform well, as with IKEA, the system


functions effectively, creating a strong competitive position.


Conversely, if several links are weak, as seen in the case of


General Motors, even improvements to certain areas will


yield minimal benefits, trapping the organization in a cycle


of ineffectiveness. Understanding this duality highlights the


importance of comprehensive improvement rather than


isolated fixes.

#### **Chapter 9 | USING DESIGN| Q&A**


**1.Question**


**How does Hannibal's victory at Cannae demonstrate the**


**importance of premeditation in strategy?**

Answer:Hannibal's success at Cannae was not by


chance but the result of meticulous planning and


design. His tactics, such as the deceptive 'mock


retreat,' were executed with precision, showing that


effective strategy requires detailed forethought and


design rather than improvisation.


**2.Question**


**What are the key components of Hannibal's strategy at**


**Cannae, and how do they relate to business strategy**


**today?**

Answer:Hannibal's strategy included careful premeditation,


anticipation of the opponent's behavior, and a coherent


design of coordinated actions. In business, these components


translate to the necessity for strategic foresight,


understanding competitor dynamics, and creating a unified


plan that aligns all organizational actions.


**3.Question**


**Why is it necessary to view strategy as more than just**


**decision-making?**

Answer:Viewing strategy merely as decision-making


oversimplifies the complexity involved. Real strategy


involves design—it's about constructing a comprehensive


framework that considers multiple factors and how they


interact to generate competitive advantages.


**4.Question**


**How does the example of BMW illustrate the concept of**


**design in strategy?**

Answer:BMW's pursuit of a 'driving machine' feel signifies


the intricate design that harmonizes various vehicle


components. This design-oriented approach leads to unique


value creation, akin to how complex strategies in business


require careful coordination and integration of various


elements.


**5.Question**


**In what way does Paccar exemplify effective strategic**


**design in a mature industry?**

Answer:Paccar maintains a high-quality image and stable


profits in a competitive market by focusing on a coherent


strategy that weaves together quality and customer relations,


resisting the temptation for quick wins and instead building


long-term, tightly integrated resources.


**6.Question**


**What danger does reliance on strategic resources pose, as**


**seen in the case of Xerox?**

Answer:Xerox's strong resource position led to complacency,


resulting in missed opportunities for innovation and


competition. This highlights that over-dependence on


existing strengths can breed organizational inertia and


vulnerability to more agile competitors.


**7.Question**


**How can understanding the cyclical nature of strategic**


**success inform future strategic endeavors?**

Answer:Recognizing that even successful firms eventually


face decline can motivate leaders to continuously innovate


and adapt their strategies. This awareness promotes


sustainable growth by learning from both historical successes


and failures.


**8.Question**


**What lesson can be drawn from Hannibal's**


**understanding of the Roman army's behavior?**

Answer:Hannibal's keen insight into the motivations and


traditions of Roman leaders allowed him to predict their


actions. This underscores the importance for businesses to


deeply understand competitor behavior to leverage


weaknesses and craft effective strategies.


**9.Question**


**How does integration in strategy relate to performance,**


**as discussed with JPL's experience?**

Answer:The JPL experience illustrates that successful


strategy design often requires integrating various subsystems


to overcome performance limitations. Clever design


maximizes resource efficiency, suggesting that thoughtful


integration is central to achieving strategic goals.


**10.Question**


**Why is flexibility important in the design of strategy, as**


**seen in the automotive industry examples?**

Answer:Flexibility allows companies to adjust and respond


to shifting market dynamics and competitive pressures. In the


automotive industry, adaptability not only enhances customer


satisfaction but also ensures sustainability against


unpredictable challenges.


#### **Chapter 10 | FOCUS| Q&A**

**1.Question**


**What are the key objectives in teaching strategy**


**identification as discussed in the chapter?**

Answer:The key objectives include: (1) teaching how


to identify a company's strategy, (2) enhancing skills


in analyzing qualitative information, and (3)


exploring the concept of focus in strategy.


**2.Question**


**What was the conventional wisdom surrounding Crown**


**Cork & Seal's strategy and why was it seen as**


**incomplete?**

Answer:The conventional wisdom was that Crown


specialized in containers for hard-to-hold products like


aerosols and soft drinks. This view was incomplete because it


did not delve into the underlying policies and unique


competitive advantages that contributed to Crown's superior


performance in the market.


**3.Question**


**How did Todd misidentify Crown Cork & Seal's strategy,**


**and what was the reality?**

Answer:Todd claimed that Crown was a low-cost producer,


assuming it made its profits through lower costs. However,


the reality was that Crown's unit costs per can were higher


than its competitors', indicating a different strategic approach


centered around higher prices due to specialized service


rather than strictly cost leadership.


**4.Question**


**What was Melissa's important observation regarding**


**technical assistance and its implications for Crown's**


**strategy?**

Answer:Melissa pointed out that putting soda in a can isn't a


difficult technical feat, implying that not all customers would


benefit from technical assistance. This questioning led to a


deeper understanding of Crown's focus on smaller businesses


that required more support, thus highlighting the unique


market segment Crown targeted.

switch suppliers. This can lead to inaccurate perceptions of


competitive vulnerabilities, as firms may overlook the need


for innovation or adaptation due to short-term profit


retention.


**8.Question**


**How did General Motors exemplify entropy and inertia**


**leading up to its 2008 bankruptcy?**

Answer:General Motors experienced both entropy and inertia


as its once-coherent product line became cluttered and


confused over decades. The lack of management focus to


maintain product distinctions led to internal competition,


blurring brand identities, ultimately culminating in financial


instability and bankruptcy.


**9.Question**


**What practical steps can leaders take to overcome**


**organizational inertia?**

Answer:Leaders can overcome inertia by diagnosing the


sources, reassessing organizational routines, fostering an


adaptive culture, and engaging in strategic management


practices such as hiring new talent from successful


competitors or redesigning processes to align with current


market demands.


**10.Question**


**Why is the constant management of entropy critical for**


**organizational success?**

Answer:Constant management of entropy is critical because


without proactive efforts to realign structure, processes, and


culture, organizations will naturally decline in effectiveness


and focus. Ongoing maintenance ensures that the


organization remains competitive and agile in a rapidly


changing business environment.
