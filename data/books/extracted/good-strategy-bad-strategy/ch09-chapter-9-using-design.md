**USING DESIGN**


The origin of the term "strategy" is rooted in military history,

but its application in business differs significantly.

Businesses compete not through destruction, but by

presenting attractive offers to customers. The larger a

company's size does not necessarily guarantee success;

rather, customer preference is a crucial factor. However,

military insights can still provide valuable business strategies

when approached carefully.

Armies first emerged during the Bronze Age alongside urban

societies, leading to organized combat. A classic illustration

of strategic design is Hannibal's victory at Cannae, where he

effectively orchestrated combat movements leading to the

complete encirclement and defeat of a much larger Roman


force. Hannibal's strategy involved meticulous planning,

anticipation of enemy behavior, and the purposeful design of

coordinated troop actions, showcasing distinct elements

crucial to effective strategy.
