## **Chapter 16 Summary : THE SCIENCE** **OF STRATEGY**

**CHAPTER SIXTEEN**


**THE SCIENCE OF STRATEGY**


Good strategy is founded on functional knowledge about

effectiveness and the reasons behind certain actions. While

available knowledge is important, proprietary knowledge

unique to an organization is invaluable.

Organizations cultivate proprietary knowledge through a

method called *scientific empiricism*, which allows for the

generation of knowledge as new strategies are implemented

and tested. A new strategy is essentially a hypothesis that is

tested through real-world experimentation, leading to

iterative adjustments based on outcomes.


**STRATEGY IS A HYPOTHESIS**


In the context of developing strategies for Hughes


Electronics, a disconnect emerges between engineering

precision and business ambiguity. Managers desire a clear

way to predict the outcomes of different strategies, reflecting

their engineering background in which certainty is

paramount. The concept of strategy as a hypothesis allows

for experimentation and adaptation based on learned

outcomes, similar to scientific inquiry.

A well-founded strategy is not merely speculative; it is

developed through educated judgments, reflecting both the

collective knowledge of the organization and the dynamic

nature of competition.


**ENLIGHTENMENT AND SCIENCE**


In times of stability, maintaining the status quo might suffice,

but true strategy requires an innovative edge particularly in a

changing environment. A focus solely on deduction ignores

opportunities for creative solutions and innovation. Historical

context reveals that the Enlightenment reinvigorated inquiry

and skepticism about assumed knowledge, which parallels

the need for a questioning approach in strategic business

decisions.


**ANOMALIES**


Anomalies represent opportunities for learning and growth,

challenging established norms. Scientific progress often

relies on recognizing and exploring these anomalies, leading

to breakthroughs in understanding.


**ESPRESSO ANOMALY**


Howard Schultz's experience in Italy exposed him to the

vibrant culture of espresso bars, which struck him as an

anomaly compared to the American coffee culture. He

hypothesized that this experience could be successfully

introduced in America, leading to the founding of Starbucks.


**COFFEE DIVERGENCE**


American coffee culture historically diverged from European

traditions, evolving into a mass-market commodity rather

than a premium product. Schultz faced the challenge of

reconciling this divergent history with his vision of elevating

coffee consumption in America through an Italian-style café

experience.


**TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS**


Schultz's journey exemplified the iterative process of

hypothesis testing. He launched *Il Giornale*, a direct

interpretation of the Italian espresso bar, learning and

adapting based on customer feedback to create a successful

coffee business.


**CAPTURING PROPRIETARY INFORMATION**


Starbucks' integration of coffee roasting, branding, and

retailing allowed for the capture of proprietary information

and enhanced learning opportunities across its operations.

This vertical integration facilitated the mutual adjustment of

various business components, an essential strategy for

maintaining a competitive edge in the market.

In conclusion, the strategic process involves embracing

creativity, testing hypotheses, and learning from anomalies,

which are crucial for fostering innovation and capturing

unique market insights.
