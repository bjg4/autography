## **Chapter 14 Summary : INERTIA AND** **ENTROPY**

**CHAPTER FOURTEEN**


**INERTIA AND ENTROPY**


In business, inertia refers to an organization’s reluctance or

inability to adjust to changes in its environment, while

entropy signifies the tendency of weakly managed

organizations to become disorderly over time. Leaders must

consistently strive to maintain their organization's focus and

structure, especially in static circumstances.


**Implications for Strategy**



**Rival Inertia**

: Successful strategies often capitalize on the inertia of

competitors.



**Internal Challenges**

: Organizational renewal is critical when faced with entropy

and inertia, necessitating comprehensive strategies to change

established routines, culture, and power dynamics.


**INERTIA**


Inertia can be classified into three forms:


**The Inertia of Routine**


- Organizations develop standard procedures that limit their

responsiveness to significant changes. Unexpected shocks

can unveil this inertia.


**The Inertia of Culture**


- Cultural inertia within organizations, such as AT&T, where

lack of product development capability stifled innovation,

can inhibit rapid adaptation to new market realities. Cultural

changes are more challenging and require simplifying and

restructuring processes.


**Inertia by Proxy**


- Firms might not respond to market changes when their

existing profit streams are still strong due to customer inertia.

This strategy can blind firms to emerging competition and

market shifts.


**ENTROPY**


Entropy often manifests as disorder within a firm. It can lead

to blurred product lines and less focus on organizational

goals.


**Examples of Entropy in Action**


- The case of Denton’s illustrates how systematic

management and the elimination of inefficiencies can restore

focus and enhance profitability.

- In contrast, General Motors demonstrated how a lack of

management over time led to product line confusion and

ultimately contributed to corporate decline and bankruptcy.

Effective management is vital; without it, the decay of

structure and order can lead to significant organizational

struggles.

In summary, addressing both inertia and entropy requires


active management and strategic foresight to navigate and

counteract these challenges effectively.
