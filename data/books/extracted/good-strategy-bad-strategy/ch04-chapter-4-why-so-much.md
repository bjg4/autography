**CHAPTER FOUR**


**WHY SO MUCH BAD STRATEGY?**


Bad strategy is prevalent not due to miscalculations, but

rather the avoidance of rigorous strategic work. Common

pathways to bad strategy include:

1.


**Unwillingness to Choose**

: Leaders may fear making tough decisions among competing

goals, resulting in vague strategies.

2.

**Template-Style Strategy**

: This involves applying boilerplate strategy frameworks

which lack depth and analytical rigor.

3.

**New Thought**

: The belief that a positive mindset alone can ensure success

overshadows actionable strategy.


**THE UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY TO**

**CHOOSE**


Strategy requires focus through difficult choices. The case of

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) illustrates the

consequences of indecision among executives. Varied

opinions on direction led to a weak consensus statement

instead of a concrete strategy. DEC suffered due to a failure

to adopt a clear path, leading to its decline and eventual

acquisition.

Optimal strategy requires making hard choices about


resource allocation—saying "no" to numerous aspirations is

crucial for effective strategy creation. Successful strategies

must navigate the psychological and political challenges of

prioritizing certain objectives over others.


**TEMPLATE-STYLE STRATEGY**


The rise of template-style strategic planning has led to

superficial strategies that satisfy organizational norms but

lack substance. Charismatic leadership has overshadowed

strategy, with leaders relying on buzzwords and inspirational

language rather than actionable plans. This results in vague

visions and missions that ultimately do not guide strategic

progress or provide meaningful insights.


**NEW THOUGHT**


The "New Thought" philosophy promotes the idea that

positive thinking can produce desired outcomes. However,

this mindset can detract from critical strategic analysis.

Effective strategy involves considering risks and potential

failures, rather than merely focusing on positive outcomes.

This oversimplification can lead to dangerous

decision-making practices in organizations.


In summary, bad strategy often arises from a combination of

avoidance of tough choices, reliance on generic templates,

and an overemphasis on positive thinking that undermines

critical analysis and effective strategic planning.


**Critical Thinking**


Key Point:Unwillingness to choose leads to

ineffective strategy formulation.


Critical Interpretation:While Rumelt emphasizes that

bad strategy primarily stems from the avoidance of

rigorous decision-making, it is vital to recognize that

organizations might struggle not only with indecision

but also with a lack of resources or information to make

informed choices. This perspective suggests that

misunderstandings about strategic alignment and

resource allocation could also contribute to ineffective

strategies. For instance, a study by Mintzberg (1994)

highlights how the environment's complexity can hinder

leaders from effectively choosing paths, calling into

question the simplicity of Rumelt's thesis. Exploring

alternative frameworks for decision making, like those

proposed in the works of Simon (1997), could provide a

more nuanced understanding of the nuances of

decision-making, extending beyond Rumelt's argument

that focuses predominantly on psychological factors.
