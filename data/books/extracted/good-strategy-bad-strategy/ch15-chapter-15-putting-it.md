## **Chapter 15 Summary : PUTTING IT** **TOGETHER**

**CHAPTER FIFTEEN**


**PUTTING IT TOGETHER**


Nvidia, a designer of 3-D graphics chips, achieved rapid

dominance in the high-performance 3-D graphics chip

market, surpassing giants like Intel. Forbes recognized

Nvidia as the "Company of the Year" in 2007, noting a

remarkable 21-fold increase in shares since its IPO in 1999.

Nvidia’s success stemmed from a good strategy characterized

by a diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent action,

underscoring the importance of anticipation, simplicity,

design, focus, and taking advantage of competitors' disarray.


**3-D GRAPHICS, UTAH, AND SGI**


3-D graphics technology allows dynamic visualization in

computer-generated environments, rooted in research from


the University of Utah. Pioneers like Jim Clark established

Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) to create high-resolution graphics

workstations and develop significant graphics standards, such

as the graphics pipeline used in films like *Jurassic Park*.


**GAMERS**


By the early 1990s, the gaming market catalyzed the demand

for 3-D graphics capabilities in personal computers, driven

by the popularity of action games like *Doom* and

*Quake*, which showcased real-time rendering. The success

of PC gaming revealed the necessity for high-performance



product but pivoted strategy after facing competition from

3dfx. Marked by a focus on 3-D graphics, Nvidia adopted the

established SGI graphical methods and planned rapid
