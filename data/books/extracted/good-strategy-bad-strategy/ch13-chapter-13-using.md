## **Chapter 13 Summary : USING** **DYNAMICS**

**CHAPTER THIRTEEN: USING DYNAMICS**


**Introduction to Strategy and High Ground**


In military strategy, holding high ground provides a natural

advantage for defense and makes it difficult for attackers. In

business strategy, the pursuit of economic high ground is

essential, yet the cost of obtaining such positions can be

prohibitive. Easy-to-capture positions tend to be transient and

can easily fall to competitors.


**Creating High Ground Through Innovation and**

**Change**


High ground can be established by innovation, as seen in

revolutionary products like Gore-Tex or FedEx’s overnight

delivery. Alternatively, businesses can seek opportunities by

riding waves of exogenous change, such as developments in


technology and market dynamics. Recognizing and adapting

to these shifts can help organizations navigate the evolving

landscape and build defensible positions.


**Historical Perspective on Change**


Many believe we live in an era of rapid change; however,

most industries experience stability most of the time. A

historical comparison of innovation from 1875 to 1925

illustrates far more profound and impactful changes than

those seen from 1942 to 1996, emphasizing the importance

of historical context in evaluating today's changes.


**Sensing Waves of Change**


Identifying waves of change early enables businesses to take

advantage of emerging opportunities. Understanding the

underlying forces at play during change is crucial, as

superficial observations often miss critical second-order

effects.


**Sensing the Wave’s Swell**


The case of Matra Communications in 1996 demonstrates the


challenges posed by change in telecommunications. While

recognizing the impending revolution in cellular telephony

and deregulation, Matra executives grapple with how

established players like Cisco surged ahead by leveraging

new technologies and market dynamics.


**Discerning the Fundamentals**


True understanding of change requires delving into details

and market shifts. The transition within telecommunications

in the 1990s illustrates the seismic shifts driven by software

innovation and the gradual breakdown of traditional vertical

structures.


**Software’s Competitive Advantage**


With millions of devices utilizing microprocessors, the

programming has become the key differentiator. The cost of

developing software is lower and more adaptable than

custom hardware, allowing quicker and more efficient

iteration, an advantage highlighted by the development of

Intel’s microprocessors.


**Why Computing Deconstructed**


The computer industry revolution transitioned from a

vertically integrated structure to a horizontal one, led by the

emergence of more intelligent components. Each segment

became independent and smart, easing systems integration

and spawning a myriad of specialized companies.


**Cisco Systems Rides the Wave**


Cisco's rapid ascent is attributed to capitalizing on several

waves of change, such as the rise of software and networking

needs. Their strategic decisions allowed them to dominate the

networking market despite competition from established

firms.


**Some Guideposts for Navigating Change**


1.

**Rising Fixed Costs:**

Increases in fixed costs often lead to industry consolidation

as only larger firms can absorb these costs.

2.

**Deregulation:**

Major policy shifts can radically alter the competitive


landscape and operational dynamics of industries.

3.

**Predictable Biases:**

Forecasting often fails to predict peak demand and industry

convergence, leading to misguided strategies.

4.

**Incumbent Response:**

Established firms typically resist changes that could

undermine their advantages, often leading to inertia.

5.

**Attractor States:**

Understanding industry dynamics helps leaders position

themselves towards a more efficient operational model, as

illustrated by Cisco's IP-centric vision.


**Conclusion**


Navigating change requires a deeper understanding of

underlying dynamics, industry trends, and the associated

risks. With clear observations and strategic acuity,

organizations can better position themselves to respond to

disruptive forces and capitalize on emerging opportunities.
