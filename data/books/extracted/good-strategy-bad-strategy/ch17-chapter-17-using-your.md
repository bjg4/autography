## **Chapter 17 Summary : USING YOUR** **HEAD**

**CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: USING YOUR HEAD**


**Introduction**


At twenty-five, the author shares his nervousness as a

doctoral student at Harvard, tasked with interviewing a senior

manager about strategy. He recounts his conversation with

Fred Fletcher, general manager of Fansteel Inc.’s Advanced

Structures division, who underscores the importance of

discussing strategy with someone outside of his usual

corporate interactions.


**The Value of Reflection**


The author reflects on a lunch conversation fifteen years

later, relating a story about Andrew Carnegie and Frederick

Taylor. Taylor’s advice to Carnegie—to create a list of the

ten most important things to do—teaches that the act of


reflection is vital for decision-making, emphasizing how

busy professionals often lose sight of their larger purposes

amid immediate demands.


**Cognitive Limitations in Strategy**


Cognitive limitations can hinder strategic thinking. The

author emphasizes that being strategic is about overcoming

myopia, allowing for a broader perspective, and recognizing

issues often overlooked by others. Effective strategists

perceive what others miss, ensuring that insights are based on

reality rather than assumptions.


**Group Dynamics in Strategy**


In a workshop focused on TiVo’s strategy, the author notes

how participants often latch onto their first insights without

deeply analyzing alternatives. He encourages them to

introspect on how they arrived at their conclusions rather

than simply sharing them. This approach highlights the

importance of critically assessing one’s judgments.


**Trusting Instincts vs. Critical Thinking**


Participants present varied responses to TiVo's challenges,

but most relied on initial hunches. The author points out that

while quick judgments can be effective, complex strategic

decisions often require deeper analysis rather than defaulting

to instinctual reactions. He advocates for revisiting

judgments and generating alternative views.


**Overcoming Quick Closure**


The discomfort with complex issues leads to a tendency for

quick closure around initial ideas. The author explains that

this can prevent the discovery of better alternatives. He

suggests techniques for generating robust strategies,

recommending a focus on identifying obstacles and

re-evaluating initial insights through structured questioning.


**Techniques for Strategic Thinking**


To combat cognitive biases, the author presents several

techniques:


**The Kernel**

: A framework consisting of diagnosis, guiding policy, and

coherent actions. This ensures a comprehensive strategy.


**Problem-Solution**

: Transitioning from what is being done to why, leading to

more effective strategies.


**Create-Destroy**

: A discipline where one actively critiques their own ideas to

foster the development of new alternatives.


**Building a Panel of Experts**


The author recommends creating a mental panel of experts to

critique ideas and stimulate new insights. This personalized

approach combines unique perspectives, ultimately

enhancing the decision-making process.


**Practicing Judgment**


Good judgment is portrayed as a skill that can be developed

through practice and reflection. By committing judgments to

writing, individuals can revisit and critique their own

reasoning, leading to improved strategic insights over time.


**Conclusion**


The chapter emphasizes that strategic thinking involves

overcoming cognitive limitations, recognizing the

importance of reflection, and practicing critical judgment. It

advocates for structured techniques to foster deeper insights,

ensuring effective strategy formulation.
