## **Chapter 10 Summary : FOCUS**

**CHAPTER TEN**


**FOCUS**


In this chapter, Richard P. Rumelt discusses a case study on

Crown Cork & Seal, a metal container manufacturer. The

main objectives of the session for executive MBAs are to

identify a company's strategy, enhance skills in analyzing

qualitative data, and explore the concept of "focus."


**Crown's Historical Performance**

- The strategy, established by John F. Connelly in the 1960s,

led to remarkable shareholder returns of 19% annually over

35 years.

- Many analysts oversimplified Crown's strategy, attributing

its success merely to its specialization in containers for

challenging products, thereby missing deeper insights.


**Industry Analysis**


- The case highlights a competitive environment where major

can manufacturers face low profit margins (4-5% return on

assets) due to fierce competition and operational challenges.

- Crown, however, outperformed these players significantly

by being 50-60% more profitable.


**Understanding Crown's Strategy**

- Initial opinions suggest Crown is a low-cost producer, but

further analysis reveals that its unit costs are likely higher

due to its focus on shorter production runs to meet specific

customer needs.


**Identifying Focus**

- The discussion progresses to differentiating policies like

technical assistance and rapid response, which are more

beneficial for smaller customers or those with urgent needs.

- The consensus emerges that Crown's focus on shorter runs

allows it to avoid being a captive producer, which enhances

its bargaining power.


**Competitive Advantage**


- By rigorously analyzing its policies, students learn that

Crown's strategy provides a competitive advantage by

aligning with the specific needs of targeted market segments.

- Crown’s approach contrasts with major competitors,

leading to increased profitability despite higher costs.


**Conclusion on Focus**

- Rumelt emphasizes that true strategy involves both the

coordination of distinct policies and aiming at the right

market targets.

- The surprise among students highlights the importance of

in-depth analysis in revealing the underlying logic of a

business's strategy, challenging the assumption that

successful companies always articulate their strategies

clearly.

- He concludes that many large organizations fail to focus

their efforts effectively, resulting in the pursuit of multiple

goals without achieving substantial progress in any.


**Example**


Key Point:The Importance of Strategic Focus for

Competitive Advantage


Example:Imagine you're leading a startup, aiming to

disrupt the tech industry. You have endless ideas and

potential products but quickly realize that scattering

your resources across all these options dilutes your

impact. Instead, you choose to focus on developing a

niche application that solves a specific problem for a

small group of users, understanding their unique needs

deeply. By concentrating your efforts on this one area,

you streamline your operations, enhance customer

satisfaction, and differentiate your product in the

market. Just like Crown Cork & Seal did with their

strategy, your focused approach gives you a significant

competitive advantage, enabling you to outperform

competitors who are still juggling multiple product lines

without a clear direction.
