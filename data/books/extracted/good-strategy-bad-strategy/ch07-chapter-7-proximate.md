## **Chapter 7 Summary : PROXIMATE** **OBJECTIVES**

**CHAPTER SEVEN**


**PROXIMATE OBJECTIVES**


One of the most important tools leaders have is the creation

of proximate objectives—attainable targets close enough at

hand. A good example is President Kennedy’s goal to land a

man on the moon by the end of the 1960s, which was

strategically sound and possible due to existing technology.

Unlike more vague lofty goals, Kennedy identified concrete

steps to achieve success through resource allocation and

coordination.


**RESOLVING AMBIGUITY**


During Kennedy's moon mission, operational clarity was

crucial. At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Phyllis

Buwalda created a specification for the lunar surface,


addressing the high levels of uncertainty about the

environment. This strategic choice allowed the engineering

teams to focus on a solvable problem instead of being

paralyzed by ambiguity, ultimately leading to successful

missions.


**TAKING A STRONG POSITION AND**

**CREATING OPTIONS**


A strategy's effectiveness increases with clarity under

uncertainty. Leaders must recognize the limitations of

foresight during dynamic situations and focus on establishing

strong positions while creating future options. In a practical

example, a small business school clarified its objectives to

enhance student job placements, which opened numerous

pathways for success.


**HIERARCHIES OF OBJECTIVES**


Proximate objectives create a cascading effect throughout

organizations, where higher-level goals inform those of

lower levels, allowing for systematic problem-solving.

Differences in resources and skills dictate what is considered

proximate for various entities. Examples illustrate how


mastering essential competencies—and layering these

skills—enables organizations to focus on more complex

objectives, whether in academia or industry. Each step of

skill development enables organizations to tackle greater

challenges in their strategic pursuits.


**Example**


Key Point:Proximate objectives are essential for

guiding teams effectively towards larger goals.


Example:Imagine you are leading a project team aiming

to innovate a new product. Instead of stating a vague

ambition to 'improve customer satisfaction', you set a

clear proximate objective: 'Increase customer feedback

response rates by 30% within three months.' This

specific target not only provides a measurable

benchmark but also aligns the team's daily activities

towards achieving this goal. By breaking down the

larger vision into achievable, focused tasks, you create

clarity and motivate your team, ensuring they know

exactly what needs to be done in short time frames to

foster overall success in the project.
