**CHAPTER ONE**


**GOOD STRATEGY IS UNEXPECTED**


Good strategy thrives where others lack it; it has coherence


that aligns actions, policies, and resources toward significant

goals. Many organizations, however, juggle multiple

initiatives without a unified strategy, often defaulting to

simply "spend more and try harder."


**APPLE**


In the mid-1990s, Apple faced severe challenges against

Microsoft's Windows-Intel dominance. Amid bankruptcies

and tumult, CEO Gil Amelio attempted various fixes, but

drastic measures were needed. Steve Jobs returned in 1997,

and his approach was unexpected; he significantly downsized

Apple's product line, focusing on a single desktop and laptop

model, cutting peripheral products, and reducing overhead.

Jobs' strategy, while grounded in basic business principles,

was surprising in its execution. He eliminated complexity

and created a cohesive business model without pushing

ambitious numeric goals. His direction was not just about

survival; he patiently awaited the next opportunity, learning

from previous experiences to harness future market changes

effectively.


**DESERT STORM**


The first Gulf War showcased surprising strategic success by

U.S. forces under General Norman Schwarzkopf. While

media and military speculation focused on traditional, costly

assaults, Schwarzkopf devised a two-pronged strategy that

utilized deception and flanking maneuvers—known as the

"left hook"—to outsmart entrenched Iraqi defenses.

Schwarzkopf's success highlighted a focused, coherent

strategy that was surprising given the complexities involved

in military operations. His ability to prioritize one clear plan

and suppress conflicting interests from various military

factions, including maritime and air force strategies, was

essential. He demonstrated that effective leadership involves

making tough choices and refusing to dilute focus with

divergent objectives.


**ENVELOPMENT**


Complex organizations often confuse their objectives,

leading to scattered resources and ineffective strategies.

Successful strategy requires leaders willing to eliminate

distractions and narrow their focus—knowing what not to

pursue is just as critical as defining active goals. Good

strategy is marked by clarity and discipline in execution,

which is often unexpected in large entities.


**Example**


Key Point:The necessity of eliminating distractions

to focus on coherent strategic objectives.


Example:Imagine working for a thriving tech startup

that suddenly decides to launch ten different products

simultaneously to capture every market segment. As

you struggle to juggle these competing priorities,

day-to-day chaos ensues, and the company's vision

dilutes significantly. Instead, envision if leadership

chose to narrow its focus, perhaps solely developing a

groundbreaking AI application, investing time and

resources toward that singular goal. This unexpected

decision could inspire the entire team to unify behind a

strong, coherent strategy, fostering innovation and

increasing the likelihood of impactful success.


**Critical Thinking**


Key Point:Good strategy often emerges from

surprising decisions that simplify and unify efforts.


Critical Interpretation:Jobs’ and Schwarzkopf’s

strategies reveal that impactful outcomes can come from

clarity and unexpected choices, challenging

conventional wisdom. However, Rumelt’s perspective

may neglect the unpredictable nature of environments

where strategies will be implemented, indicating that

external dynamics and unforeseen circumstances can

significantly influence the effectiveness of what he

deems 'good strategy.' For alternative views on strategic

planning, consider references like 'The Innovator's

Dilemma' by Clayton Christensen, which discusses the

challenges of maintaining a focused strategy amidst

disruptive market forces.
