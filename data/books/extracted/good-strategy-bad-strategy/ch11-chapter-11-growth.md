## **Chapter 11 Summary : GROWTH**

**CHAPTER ELEVEN**


**GROWTH**


In 1989, John Connelly transitioned leadership at Crown

Cork & Seal to William Avery due to health issues.

Connelly's death followed shortly after. Avery aimed to

ignite growth through acquisitions, addressing the company's

stagnation during the 1980s, aided by a team with acquisition

expertise.

Avery's strategy led to major acquisitions between 1990 and

1993, including Continental Can, Constar, Van Dorn, and

Tri-Valley Growers, doubling the size of Crown. In 1995,

Crown pursued CarnaudMetalBox, aiming for a global

foundation for growth. By 1997, with twenty acquisitions

completed, Crown became the largest container

manufacturer.

However, issues emerged in 1998. The boom in plastic

containers was unsustainable, resulting in market saturation

and declining sales. Moreover, Crown faced declining prices


in the metal can sector due to overcapacity and fierce

competition. This downturn caused a catastrophic drop in

stock prices from 1998 to 2001, leading to Avery's retirement

and the appointment of John Conway, who shifted focus

from growth to cost management and quality.

Despite rapid growth from 1990 to 2006, shareholder returns

fell sharply compared to previous years. The company's

profits also declined, highlighting the difference between

revenue growth and return on capital. Avery's

acquisition-heavy strategy neglected Crown's traditional

competitive advantages, as new entrants capitalized on

changing market dynamics.

Seeking expansion often leads to overvaluation in

acquisitions. Corporate leaders may pursue growth due to

misguided beliefs in cost reductions or larger payouts for

themselves, influenced by investment advisers eager for

lucrative fees.

The chapter discusses the future challenges

telecommunications company Telecom Italia faced,

including increased competition and deregulation. Their

proposed merger with Cable & Wireless was rife with

misguided rationales based on economies of scale without

adequate justification. Ultimately, healthy growth stems from

genuine demand for unique capabilities, innovation, and


efficiency rather than merely engineering growth through

acquisitions.
