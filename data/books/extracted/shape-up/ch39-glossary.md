### **Glossary**

_**Appetite**_


The amount of time we want to spend on a project, as opposed to


an estimate.


_**Baseline**_


What customers are doing without the thing we’re


currently building.


_**Bet**_


The decision to commit a team to a project for one cycle with no

interruptions and an expectation to finish.


_**Betting table**_


A meeting during cool-down when stakeholders decide which


pitches to bet on in the next cycle.


_**Big batch**_


One project that occupies a team for a whole cycle and ships at


the end.


_**Breadboard**_

A UI concept that defines affordances and their connections


without visual styling.


_**Circuit breaker**_


A risk management technique: Cancel projects that don’t ship in


one cycle by default instead of extending them by default.


_**Cleanup mode**_


The last phase of building a new product, where we don’t shape


or bet on any particular projects but instead allocate unstructured

time to fix whatever is needed before launch.

_**Cool-down**_

A two-week break between cycles to do ad-hoc tasks, fix bugs, and


hold a betting table.


_**Cycle**_


A six week period of time where teams work uninterruptedly on


shaped projects.


_**De-risk**_


Improve the odds of shipping within one cycle by shaping and


removing rabbit holes.


_**Discovered tasks**_

Tasks the team discovers they need to do after they start getting


involved in the real work.


_**Downhill**_


The phase of a task, scope or project where all unknowns are solved

and only execution is left.


_**Fat marker sketch**_

A sketch of a UI concept at very low fidelity drawn with a thick line.


_**Hill chart**_


A diagram showing the status of work on a spectrum from


unknown to known to done.


_**Iceberg**_


A scope of work where the back-end work is much more complex


than the UI or vice versa.


_**Imagined tasks**_

Work the teams decide they need to do after just thinking about the


project. See discovered tasks.

_**Layer cake**_


A scope of work you can estimate by looking at the surface area of


the UI.


_**Level of abstraction**_


The amount of detail we leave in or out when describing a problem


or solution.


_**Must-haves**_


Tasks that must be completed for a scope to be considered done.


_**Nice-to-haves**_

Task left for the end of the cycle. If there isn’t time to do them, they


get cut. Marked with a ‘~’ at the beginning.


_**Pitch**_


A document that presents a shaped project idea for consideration at


the betting table.


_**Production mode**_


A phase of building a new product where the core architecture is


settled and we apply the standard Shape Up process.


_**Rabbit hole**_


Part of a project that is too unknown, complex, or open-ended


to bet on.


_**R&D mode**_


A phase of building a new product where a senior team spikes the

core features to define the core architecture.


_**Raw ideas**_


Requests or feature ideas that are expressed in words and haven’t


been shaped.

_**Scopes**_

Parts of a project that can be built, integrated, and finished inde­


pendently of the rest of the project.


_**Scope hammering**_


Forcefully questioning a design, implementation, or use case to cut

scope and finish inside the fixed time box.


_**Shape**_

Make an abstract project idea more concrete by defining key ele­


ments of the solution before betting on it.


_**Six weeks**_

The length of our cycles. Six weeks is long enough to finish some­


thing meaningful and short enough to feel the deadline from the


beginning.


_**Small batch**_


A set of 1-2 week projects that a single team ships by the end of a six


week cycle.


_**Time horizon**_


The longest period of time where we can feel a deadline pushing on


us from the beginning. Six weeks.


_**Uphill**_


The phase of a task, scope or project where there are still unkowns


or unsolved problems. See downhill.
