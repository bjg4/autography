##### A Basecamp Team for shaping


1. Create a Basecamp Team for shaping. We


call ours “Product Strategy.”


2. Add the people doing the shaping, any trusted people


who give feedback on pitches, and the people who


bet at the betting table. Keep this group small and an­


nounce the bets more widely elsewhere (we use Base­

camp’s HQ for that), when it’s time to kick off a cycle.


3. Post pitches as Messages on the Message Board.


We created a Message Category called “Pitch”


with the light bulb emoji for the icon.


4. Use the Campfire chat room to bounce ideas and co­


ordinate the betting table between cycles. We conduct


the actual betting table meeting over video chat.

##### Basecamp Projects for the cycle projects


1. Create a Basecamp Project for each project in the six

week cycle. We usually prepend a name or number


for the cycle like this: “Cycle 4: Autopay.”


2. Add the designer and program­


mers who are working on this


project to the Basecamp Project.


3. Post a kick-off message to the


Message Board with the pitch



or a restatement of the shaped


work for the team’s reference.

##### To-Do Lists for scopes

1. After the team gets oriented they start spiking, dis­


cover tasks, and map them into scopes.


2. In the Basecamp Project, the team creates a To-Do List for each


scope, like “Start Autopay” or “ACH Option.” Sometimes we use

the description field on the To-Do List to summarize the scope.


3. Add design _and_ programming tasks to each scope as To-Do


Items. For example, “Start Autopay” has one task for design


the UI and another task for wiring it to the existing recur­


ring billing API. They can use the discussion thread on each


To-Do Item to post updates or ask each other questions.


4. Repeat as the team discovers new scopes and tasks.

##### Track scopes on the Hill Chart


1. Navigate to the To-Do List page for each scope and click


the options menu (•••) in the upper right. Click “Track


this on the Hill Chart.” That will display a Hill Chart at


the top of the overall To-Dos section of the Project, with


a dot corresponding to that scope (To-Do List).


2. Repeat for each scope (To-Do List).


3. Click “Update” on the Hill Chart and drag the dots to show


progress from “unknown” to “known” to “done.” Use the


annotation feature to add commentary when necessary.

4. To see the history of updates to the Hill Chart, click the time­


stamp above the Hill Chart where it says “last update.”

Other tools make it hard to see everything about the project in one


place. Basecamp combines chat, messages, to-dos, and documents


in one interface that’s powerful enough for technical people and


friendly enough for everyone else to use. Programmers, design­


ers, QA and managers feel equally at home and can work together


seamlessly on projects. Visit basecamp.com to try Basecamp free


for 30 days.
