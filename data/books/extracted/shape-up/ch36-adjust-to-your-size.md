### **Adjust to Your Size**

##### Basic truths vs. specific practices

To apply Shape Up to your company, it helps to separate out the

basic truths from the specific practices.


Work has to come from somewhere, and it takes work to figure


out what the right work is. This is shaping. Shaping the work sets


clearer boundaries and expectations for whoever does the work—


whether that’s a separate team or just your future self. If we don’t

make trade-offs up front by shaping, the universe will force us to

make trade-offs later in a mad rush when we’re confronted by dead­


lines, technical limitations, or resource constraints.


The same is true with betting. Six weeks might not be the exact


time frame for your team. But the consequences of making unclear


or open-ended commitments are the same for everyone. Regardless

of the specific time frame we bet on, we should be deliberate about


what we bet on and cap our downside with a circuit breaker.


In the building phase, there will be unknowns to deal with whether


you track them on a hill chart or not. We need to distinguish the


knowns from the unknowns so we can sequence the work in the


right order and reserve capacity for the unknowns.


These truths apply regardless of the size of your organization. The

specific practices, on the other hand, are scale-dependent. Let’s


have a look at what it means to implement Shape Up at a very small


start-up and an organization that’s grown big enough for special­


ized roles and more structure.

##### Small enough to wing it

When your team is just two or three people, everybody does a bit of


everything. Since a few people are wearing many hats and per­

forming many roles, it’s difficult to commit long chunks of uninter­

rupted time to specific projects. The person doing the programming


might also be answering customer requests and dealing with an


infrastructure issue all at the same time.


It’s also easier to communicate and change course when you’re


small. You can drop something in the group chat or talk about it in


person and everyone’s immediately on the same page.


For these reasons, a tiny team can throw out most of the structure.


You don’t need to work six weeks at a time. You don’t need a cool

down period, formal pitches or a betting table. Instead of parallel


tracks with dedicated shapers and builders, the same people can


alternate back and forth. Be deliberate about which hat you’re


wearing and what phase you’re in. Set an appetite, shape what to


do next, build it, then shape the next thing. Your bets might be

different sizes each time: maybe two weeks here, three weeks there.


You’re still shaping, betting, and building, but you’re doing it more

fluidly without the rigid structure of cycles and cool-downs.

##### Big enough to specialize

After you hire more people, all of this fluidity flips from an asset to


a liability. Winging it with ad-hoc meetings and chat room discus­


sions doesn’t work anymore. Coordination starts to eat up more of


your time and things begin to slip through the cracks.


This is when it makes sense to take on the structure of six-week


cycles, cool-downs, and a formal betting table. With more people


available to build, someone needs to carve out more time to do

the work of figuring out _what_ to build. This could mean a founder


spends more time shaping than building, or it could mean elevat­


ing an employee from doing in-cycle design work to more out-of-cy­


cle shaping work.


At Basecamp’s current size (about 50 people in the whole company,


roughly a dozen in the product team) we’ve been able to specialize


roles so teams of designers and programmers can work without any


interruption in the cycles. A dedicated team called SIP (Security, In­


frastructure, and Performance) handles technical work that’s lower


in the stack and more structural. Our Ops team keeps the lights on.


We have technical people on the Support team who can investigate


problems raised by customers. All this means that we don’t need to


interrupt the designers and programmers on our Core Product team


who work on shaped projects within the cycles.

With dedicated shapers and builders, the picture is more structured.


Shapers work on an “out of cycle” track. Cool-down between cycles

gives everyone room to fix bugs and address loose ends that pop up.


The betting table is held during cool-down and then bets are placed


for the next cycle.


_With more people, shaping and building happen on separate tracks_

_and bets are made to fill six-week cycles_
