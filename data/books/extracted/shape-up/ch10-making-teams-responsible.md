##### Making teams responsible


Third, we **give full responsibility** to a small integrated team of

designers and programmers. They define their own tasks, make


adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices

of the product one at a time. This is completely different from other


methodologies, where managers chop up the work and program­


mers act like ticket-takers.


Together, these concepts form a virtuous circle. When teams are


more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing


them. With less time spent on management, senior people can


shape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams


have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously.
