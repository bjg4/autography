##### Six-week cycles


First, we work in **six-week cycles** . Six weeks is long enough to

build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that


everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use


the time wisely. The majority of our new features are built and


released in one six-week cycle.


Our decisions are based on moving the product forward in the


next six weeks, not micromanaging time. We don’t count hours or


question how individual days are spent. We don’t have daily meet­


ings. We don’t rethink our roadmap every two weeks. Our focus is

at a higher level. We say to ourselves: “If this project ships after six


weeks, we’ll be really happy. We’ll feel our time was well spent.”


Then we commit the six weeks and leave the team alone to get


it done.
