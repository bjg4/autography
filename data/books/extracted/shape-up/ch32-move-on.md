### **Move On**

##### Let the storm pass

Shipping can actually generate new work if you’re not careful.


Feature releases beget feature requests. Customers say “Okay, that’s


great, but what about that other thing we’ve been asking for?”


Bugs pop up. Suggestions for improvements come in. Everyone is


focused on the new thing and reacting to it.


The feedback can be especially intense if the feature you shipped

changes existing workflows. Even purely visual changes sometimes


spur intense pushback. A small minority of customers might over­


react and say things like “You ruined it! Change it back!”


It’s important to stay cool and avoid knee-jerk reactions. Give it a

few days and allow it to die down. Be firm and remember why you

made the change in the first place and who the change is helping.

##### Stay debt-free


It can be tempting to commit to making changes in response to


feedback, but then you no longer have a clean slate for the next


cycle. Remember: these are just raw ideas coming in. The way to


handle them is with a gentle “no.” Saying “no” doesn’t prevent you


from continuing to contemplate them and maybe shape them up


into future projects. Saying “yes,” on the other hand, takes away


your freedom in the future. It’s like taking on debt.


Remember, the thing you just shipped was a six-week bet. If this


part of the product needs more time, then it requires a new bet. Let


the requests or bugs that just came up compete with everything else


at the next betting table to be sure they’re strategically important.

##### Feedback needs to be shaped

Here we come full circle. The raw ideas that just came in from cus­


tomer feedback aren’t actionable yet. They need to be shaped. They


are the raw inputs that we talked about in step one of the shaping


process: Set Boundaries.


If a request is truly important, you can make it your top priority on


the shaping track of the next cycle. Bet on something else for the


teams to build and use that time to properly shape the new idea.


Then, when the six weeks are over, you can make the case at the


betting table and schedule the shaped version of the project for the


greatest chance of success.
