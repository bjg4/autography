##### Option B: Start with shaping


Sometimes it’s not possible to get a team together to work for six


weeks because somebody else, a CTO perhaps, controls the pro­


grammers’ time. In that case, you can start by shaping a compelling


project with clearer boundaries than past projects. Present the


project and put it through your company’s existing scheduling


process (even if it’s a paper shredder). Better-shaped work can


shine a light on the engineering team and help them open up to


things like longer cycles or a more deliberate betting process.

##### Option C: Start with cycles


Another approach is to start by working in six week cycles. For


teams that formerly used two-week sprints, this removes the over­


head of constant planning meetings and gives programmers more


time to build momentum and hit their stride. Once the team has


more room to breathe, it’ll be natural to think more about how to


shape the work to take advantage of this new capacity.

##### Fix shipping first

Build your shipping muscles before you worry too much about im­


proving your research or discovery process. You can have the best


customer insight in the world, but if you can’t turn it into a project

and ship, it won’t matter. First get the team into a rhythm of finish­


ing things. Once you have the capability to ship, then you can start


improving the inputs to your shaping process.

##### Focus on the end result


Sometimes it can be scary to give the teams more free rein to set


their own tasks and schedule. You might wonder: What if they


don’t use up all the time we dedicate for the cycle? What if one of


the programmers or designers sits idle at some point in the cycle?


To overcome these worries, shift the mindset from the micro to the

macro. Ask yourself: How will we feel if we ship this project after


six weeks? Will we feel good about what we accomplished? When


projects ship on time and everyone feels they made progress, that’s


the success. It doesn’t matter what exactly happened down at the


scale of hours or days along the way. It’s the outcome that matters.
