About the Author 176


### **Foreword by Jason Fried**

The way a team works has an enormous influence on what it can do.


The process, the methods, the practices, the approach, the disci­


pline, the trust, the communication style, the pace. The way—the


how—is foundational and fundamental.


You’ll often hear people say “execution is everything,” but that’s

not quite right. In fact, it’s often quite wrong.


When it comes to project work, and specifically software devel­


opment, executing something the wrong way can destroy morale,


grind teams down, erode trust, crunch gears, and wreck the ma­


chinery of long-term progress. So yeah, it’s “done,” but at what


cost? By doing, what have we done to ourselves? Do we really have

to do that again, over and over month after month, year after year?


How many projects have you been a part of that you’d want to do


over? How many projects have gone long, piled up at the end, and


burned people out? How many projects were essentially collections


of unreasonable expectations? How many projects turned teams


against each other, frustrated everyone from builder to stakeholder,

and ultimately would have been better off dying than delivering?


Sometimes execution is everything—everything that’s wrong. So


what does executing right look like?


Over the last few years, there’s been a heightened curiosity about

how we work at Basecamp. People often ask us how we get so much


done so quickly at such a high level of quality with such a small


team. And how we keep our teams together for years and years.


For one, we’re not into waterfall or agile or scrum. For two, we don’t



**8**


line walls with Post-it notes. For three, we don’t do daily stand ups,


design sprints, development sprints, or anything remotely tied to


a metaphor that includes being tired and worn out at the end. No


backlogs, no Kanban, no velocity tracking, none of that.


We have an entirely different approach. One developed in isolation


over nearly 15 years of constant trial and error, taking note, iterat­


ing, honing in, and polishing up. We’ve shaped our own way.


Blog posts, workshops, and occasional conference talks have pro­


vided glimpses of our own unique process, but we’ve never laid it


bare for all to see. This book does just that.


Now that our process is fully formed, documented, and ready to


go, we’re here to share it with all those curious enough to listen to a


new way of doing things. Explorers, pioneers, those who don’t care


what everyone else is doing. Those who want to work better than


the rest.


Don’t think of this as a book. Think of it as a flashlight. You and your


team have fumbled around in the dark long enough. Now you’ve got

something bright and powerful to help you find a new way.


We hope you find it interesting, enlightening, and, most of


all, helpful.


Thanks for reading.

### **Acknowledgements**

Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, Basecamp’s found­


ers, planted many of the seeds for this book. It is informed by

their values, Basecamp’s culture, and fifteen years of collaborative


trial-and-error.


Bob Moesta and Chris Spiek made pivotal contributions. This book


wouldn’t have come together without their help.


Yaneer Bar-Yam’s lectures at the New England Complex Systems


Institute helped me structure the method.


The expert designers and programmers at Basecamp tried, tested,


and improved these techniques over the years to ship real projects.

Their efforts make this a book of practice, not theory.

### **Introduction**

This book is a guide to how we do product development at Base­


camp. It’s also a toolbox full of techniques that you can apply in


your own way to your own process.


Whether you’re a founder, CTO, product manager, designer, or de­


veloper, you’re probably here because of some common challenges

that all software companies have to face.

##### Growing pains

As software teams start to grow, some common struggles appear:


- Team members feel like projects go on


and on, with no end in sight.


- Product managers can’t find time to think


strategically about the product.


- Founders ask themselves: “Why can’t we get features


out the door like we used to in the early days?”


We saw these challenges first-hand at Basecamp as we grew from

four people to over fifty.


Basecamp started off in 2003 as a tool we built for ourselves. At the


time we were a consultancy designing websites for clients. Infor­


mation would get lost in the game of telephone between the client,


the designer, and the person managing the project. We wanted


Basecamp to be a centralized place where all parties could see


the work, discuss it, and know what to do next. It turned out lots


of companies had this “information slipping through the cracks”


problem. Today millions of people across all kinds of industries rely


C H A P T E R 1 - I n t r o d u c t i o n **1 1**


on Basecamp as their shared source of truth.


Three of us built the first version. Jason Fried, Basecamp’s founder,


led the design. His co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson, pro­


grammed it (and created the well-known web framework Ruby on


Rails as a by-product). At the time I was a web designer with a focus


on usability and user interfaces. I executed Jason’s design direc­

tion for key features of the app and collaborated with him to fill in


details of the concept.


From the first prototypes in July 2003 to launch in February 2004,


David only worked ten hours a week. We knew we wouldn’t get any­


where with those ten hours of programming unless we used them


very deliberately. Our intense focus on “hammering” the scope to

fit within a given time budget was born under these constraints.


As the business grew, I started widening my skills. Working with


David and Ruby on Rails made the world of programming accessi­


ble to me. I learned the techniques programmers use to tame com­


plexity: things like factoring, levels of abstraction, and separation


of concerns. With one foot in the design world and one foot in the

programming world, I wondered if we could apply these software


development principles to the way we designed and managed


the product.


The first test of this idea came in 2009. By then we had hired a few

more programmers and offered four separate software-as-a-service


products. We wanted to bundle the products together into a seam­

less suite with single-sign-on and unified billing. It was a massive

technical undertaking with treacherous user-facing flows. Besides


getting the underlying architecture right, we had to interrupt cus­


tomers on their way in to the product and make them change their



**1 2**


username and password for reasons that weren’t easy to explain.


I wore the designer and product manager hats on the project and


prototyped the breadboarding and scope mapping techniques


described in this book to manage the complexity.


We had such good results that we decided to apply the same tech­


niques again in 2012, when we redesigned Basecamp from scratch


for version 2.0. Again there was a lot of surface area to manage and


again the process was surprisingly smooth.


By 2015, we had a core team that had lived through these expe­


riences and hit an impressive stride. But we found it hard to ar­


ticulate what we were doing to new hires. Our product team had


quadrupled and everyone worked remotely. That made it hard to


pass on our intuitions. We needed language to describe what we


were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale.


To manage this new capacity, we switched from ad-hoc project

lengths to repeating cycles. (It took some experimentation to find


the right cycle length: six weeks. More on that later.) We formalized

our pitching and betting processes. My role shifted again, from


design and product management to product strategy. I needed new


language, like the word “shaping”, to describe the up-front design


work we did to set boundaries and reduce risks on projects before


we committed them to teams.


Just as we were getting better at articulating the way we work to


ourselves, more and more of our friends and peers started coming


to us to ask how we do it. Finally Jason pulled me aside one day


and said, I think you should write a book about this.


This is the result. You can think of this as two books in one. First,


it’s a book of basic truths. I want it to give you better language to


C H A P T E R 1 - I n t r o d u c t i o n **1 3**


describe and deal with the risks, uncertainties, and challenges that


come up whenever you do product development. Second, the book

outlines the specific processes we’re using to make meaningful


progress on our products at our current scale.


Here’s a short overview of the main ideas in the book.

##### Six-week cycles


First, we work in **six-week cycles** . Six weeks is long enough to

build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that


everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use


the time wisely. The majority of our new features are built and


released in one six-week cycle.


Our decisions are based on moving the product forward in the


next six weeks, not micromanaging time. We don’t count hours or


question how individual days are spent. We don’t have daily meet­


ings. We don’t rethink our roadmap every two weeks. Our focus is

at a higher level. We say to ourselves: “If this project ships after six


weeks, we’ll be really happy. We’ll feel our time was well spent.”


Then we commit the six weeks and leave the team alone to get


it done.

##### Shaping the work


Second, we **shape the work** before giving it to a team. A small

senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define the


key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet

on. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete


enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that


they have room to work out the interesting details themselves.


When shaping, we focus less on estimates and more on our



**1 4**


**appetite** . Instead of asking how much time it will _take_ to do some


work, we ask: How much time do we want to _spend_ ? How much is


this idea worth? This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the

problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the


constraints of our appetite.

##### Making teams responsible


Third, we **give full responsibility** to a small integrated team of

designers and programmers. They define their own tasks, make


adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices

of the product one at a time. This is completely different from other


methodologies, where managers chop up the work and program­


mers act like ticket-takers.


Together, these concepts form a virtuous circle. When teams are


more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing


them. With less time spent on management, senior people can


shape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams


have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously.

##### Targeting risk

At every step of the process we target a specific risk: the risk of not


shipping on time. This book isn’t about the risk of building the


wrong thing. Other books can help you with that (we recommend


Competing Against Luck). Improving your discovery process should

come after regaining your ability to ship. You can have the best


strategy in the world, but if you can’t act on it, what good does


it do?


This book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting


bogged down with last quarter’s work, wasting time on unexpected


C H A P T E R 1 - I n t r o d u c t i o n **1 5**


problems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow.


We reduce risk in the shaping process by solving open questions


_before_ we commit the project to a time box. We don’t give a project


to a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.


We reduce risk in the planning process by capping our bets to six


weeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension.


This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the

original appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first.


And lastly we reduce risk in the building process by integrating


design and programming early. Instead of building lots of discon­

nected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we


build one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and


then repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown


to the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what


doesn’t by integrating as soon as possible.

##### How this book is organized


Part One is all about **Shaping** — the pre-work we do on projects


before we consider them ready to schedule. Each chapter explains

a specific step of the process, from setting the appetite on a raw


idea, to sketching out a solution, to writing a pitch that presents

the potential project. Along the way you’ll learn specific techniques


— like breadboarding and fat-marker sketching — to keep the design


at the right level of abstraction.


Part Two is about **Betting** — how we choose among the pitched


projects and decide what to do six weeks at a time.


Part Three is about **Building** — the expectations we place on the


teams and the special practices they use to discover what to do.


**1 6**


We’ll look at how the teams figure out what to do, how they in­


tegrate design and programming, how they track what’s known

versus unknown, and finally how they make the hard calls to finish


the project on time.


Lastly the Appendix gives you some help for when it’s time to make


changes at your company. There’s some advice on how to try your

first six-week experiment, tips on adjusting the methods to your

company’s size, and specific guidance for how to implement Shape


Up using Basecamp.

##### **P A R T O N E**
## Shaping


### **Principles of Shaping**

When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of


abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete. Product managers

often err on one of these two extremes.

##### Wireframes are too concrete

When design leaders go straight to wireframes or high-fidelity

mockups, they define too much detail too early. This leaves design­


ers no room for creativity. One friend put it this way:


_I’ll give a wireframe to my designer, and then I’m saying to her:_


_“I know you’re looking at this, but that’s not what I want you to_


_design. I want you to re-think it!” It’s hard to do that when you’re_


_giving them this concrete thing._


Over-specifying the design also leads to estimation errors. Counter­

intuitive as it may seem, the more specific the work is, the harder it


can be to estimate. That’s because making the interface _just so_ can



**2 0**


require solving hidden complexities and implementation details


that weren’t visible in the mockup. When the scope isn’t variable,


the team can’t reconsider a design decision that is turning out to


cost more than it’s worth.

##### Words are too abstract


On the other end of the spectrum, projects that are too vague don’t

work either. When a project is defined in a few words, nobody


knows what it means. “Build a calendar view” or “add group

notifications” sound sensible, but what exactly do they entail?

Team members don’t have enough information to make trade-offs.


They don’t know what to include or leave out. A programmer who


worked in that situation said:


_You’re solving a problem with no context. You have to be a mind_


_reader. It’s like: “we’ll know it when we see it.”_


Concerning estimation, under-specified projects naturally grow out

of control because there’s no boundary to define what’s out of scope.

##### Case study: The Dot Grid Calendar


Let’s look at an example of how to shape a project at the right level


of detail.


We launched version three of Basecamp without a calendar feature.

It had a “schedule” feature that just listed events one after the other


without any kind of monthly, weekly or daily grid.


Soon after launch, customers started asking us to “add a calendar”


to Basecamp. We had built calendars before and we knew how


complex they are. It can easily take six months or more to build a


proper calendar.


C H A P T E R 2 - P r i n c i p l e s o f S h a p i n g **2 1**


These are the kinds of things that make a calendar complicated:


- Dragging and dropping events between cells to move them


- Wrapping multi-day events around the edge of the screen


- Different views for monthly, weekly, or daily time scales


- Dragging the edge of an event to change its duration


- Color coding events for different categories


- Handling different expectations for


desktop vs. mobile interactions


Past versions of Basecamp had calendars, and only about 10% of


customers used them. That’s why we didn’t have the appetite for


spending six months on a calendar. On the other hand, if we could


do something to satisfy those customers who were writing us in one


six week cycle, we were open to doing that.


With only six weeks to work with, we could only build about a tenth


of what people think of when they say “calendar.” The question


became: which tenth?


We did some research (discussed in the next chapter) and narrowed


down a use case that we wanted to solve. We eventually arrived at


a promising concept inspired by calendars on phones. We could


build a two-month, read-only grid view. Any day with an event


would have a dot for each event. A list of events would appear


below the calendar, and clicking a day with a dot would scroll the


events for that day into view. We called it the Dot Grid.


The Dot Grid wasn’t a full-featured calendar. We weren’t going to


allow dragging events between days. We weren’t going to span



**2 2**


multi-day events across the grid; we’d just repeat the dots. There’d


be no color coding or categories for events. We were comfortable

with all these trade-offs because of our understanding of the


use case.


This is the level of fidelity we used to define the solution:


_Rough sketch of the Dot Grid concept_


Note how rough the sketch is and how many details are left out.


The designer had a lot of room to interpret how this should look


and feel.


C H A P T E R 2 - P r i n c i p l e s o f S h a p i n g **2 3**


At the same time, note how specific the idea is. It’s very clear how it


works, what needs to be built, what’s in and what’s out.


At the end of the project, the finished work that the designers and


programmers created looked like this:


_Screenshot of the Dot Grid when it launched_


This small example highlights a few properties of shaped work.

##### Property 1: It’s rough


Work in the shaping stage is rough. Everyone can tell by looking

at it that it’s unfinished. They can see the open spaces where

their contributions will go. Work that’s too fine, too early commits



**2 4**


everyone to the wrong details. Designers and programmers need


room to apply their own judgement and expertise when they roll up

their sleeves and discover all the real trade-offs that emerge.

##### Property 2: It’s solved

Despite being rough and unfinished, shaped work has been


thought through. All the main elements of the solution are there at

the macro level and they connect together. The work isn’t specified


down to individual tasks, but the overall solution is spelled out.


While surprises might still happen and icebergs could still emerge,


there is clear direction showing what to do. Any open questions or


rabbit holes we could see up front have been removed to reduce the


project’s risk.

##### Property 3: It’s bounded


Lastly, shaped work indicates what _not_ to do. It tells the team where

to stop. There’s a specific appetite—the amount of time the team


is allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within

that fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving

specific things out.


Taken together, the roughness leaves room for the team to resolve


all the details, while the solution and boundaries act like guard

rails. They reduce risk and channel the team’s efforts, making sure


they don’t build too much, wander around, or get stuck.

##### Who shapes


Shaping is creative and integrative. It requires combining interface


ideas with technical possibilities with business priorities. To do


that you’ll need to either embody these skills as a generalist or


collaborate with one or two other people.


C H A P T E R 2 - P r i n c i p l e s o f S h a p i n g **2 5**


Shaping is primarily design work. The shaped concept is an interac­

tion design viewed from the user’s perspective. It defines what the

feature does, how it works, and where it fits into existing flows.


You don’t need to be a programmer to shape, but you need to be


technically literate. You should be able to judge what’s possible,


what’s easy and what’s hard. Knowledge about how the system


works will help you see opportunities or obstacles for implement­


ing your idea.


It’s also strategic work. Setting the appetite and coming up with a


solution requires you to be critical about the problem. What are we


trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which

customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of


something else?


Shaping is a closed-door, creative process. You might be alone


sketching on paper or in front of a whiteboard with a close col­


laborator. There’ll be rough diagrams in front of you that nobody


outside the room would be able to interpret. When working with


a collaborator, you move fast, speak frankly and jump from one


promising position to another. It’s that kind of private, rough,


early work.

##### Two tracks


You can’t really schedule shaping work because, by its very nature,


unshaped work is risky and unknown. For that reason we have


two separate tracks: one for shaping, one for building. During any


six week cycle, the teams are building work that’s been previously


shaped and the shapers are working on what the teams might po­


tentially build in a future cycle. Work on the shaping track is kept


private and not shared with the wider team until the commitment



**2 6**


has been made to bet on it. That gives the shapers the option to put


work-in-progress on the shelf or drop it when it’s not working out.

##### Steps to shaping


Shaping has four main steps that we will cover in the next


four chapters.


1. **Set boundaries.** First we figure out how much time

the raw idea is worth and how to define the problem.


This gives us the basic boundaries to shape into.


2. **Rough out the elements.** Then comes the creative work


of sketching a solution. We do this at a higher level of


abstraction than wireframes in order to move fast and


explore a wide enough range of possibilities. The output


of this step is an idea that solves the problem within the

appetite but without all the fine details worked out.


3. **Address risks and rabbit holes.** Once we think we have a

solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered


questions that could trip up the team. We amend the solu­


tion, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain tricky


spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time.


4. **Write the pitch** . Once we think we’ve shaped it enough to


potentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called


a pitch. The pitch summarizes the problem, constraints, solu­


tion, rabbit holes, and limitations. The pitch goes to the betting


table for consideration. If the project gets chosen, the pitch

can be re-used at kick-off to explain the project to the team.


C H A P T E R 2 - P r i n c i p l e s o f S h a p i n g **2 7**


### **Set Boundaries**

The first step of shaping is setting boundaries on what we’re trying

to do. The conversations we have are going to be entirely different if


people think we’re talking about a small improvement or a


major redesign.


The conversation about building a feature always starts with a raw

idea, like “customers are asking for group notifications.” Before


we all go down the rabbit hole discussing ways we can solve it, we

should first set some broad terms on the discussion to make


it productive.

##### Setting the appetite


Sometimes an idea gets us excited right away. In that case we need


to temper the excitement by checking whether this is really some­


thing we’re going to be able to invest time in or not. If we don’t stop


to think about how valuable the idea is, we can all jump too quickly


to either committing resources or having long discussions about


potential solutions that go nowhere.



**2 8**


Other ideas are less exciting and feel more like a challenge we


didn’t ask for. The customer wants a calendar; we don’t particularly


want to build one, but we do feel we need to do something about


the request.


Whether we’re chomping at the bit or reluctant to dive in, it helps

to explicitly define how much of our time and attention the subject

deserves. Is this something worth a quick fix if we can manage?


Is it a big idea worth an entire cycle? Would we redesign what we


already have to accommodate it? Will we only consider it if we can


implement it as a minor tweak?


We call this the appetite. You can think of the appetite as a time


budget for a standard team size. We usually set the appetite in


two sizes:


- Small Batch: This is a project that a team of one designer and


one or two programmers can build in one or two weeks. We


batch these together into a six week cycle (more on that later).


- Big Batch: This project takes the same-size team a full six-weeks.


In rare cases where the scope is so big that a six-week project isn’t


conceivable, we’ll try to hammer it down by narrowing the problem

definition. If we still can’t shrink the scope, we’ll break off a mean­


ingful part of the project that we can shape to a six-week appetite.

##### Fixed time, variable scope

An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates


start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a


number and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative


constraint on the design process.


C H A P T E R 3 - S e t B o u n d a r i e s **2 9**


This principle, called “fixed time, variable scope,” is key to success­

fully defining and shipping projects. Take this book for an example.


It’s hard to ship a book when you can always add more, explain


more, or improve what’s already there. When you have a dead­


line, all of a sudden you have to make decisions. With one week

left, I can choose between fixing typos or adding a new section to


a chapter. That’s the tension between time, quality, and scope. I


don’t want to release a book with embarrassing typos, so I’ll choose


to reduce the scope by leaving out the extra section. Without the

pressure of the fixed deadline, I wouldn’t make the trade-off. If the


scope wasn’t variable, I’d _have_ to include the extra section. Then

there’d be no time to fix the quality issues.


We apply this principle at each stage of the process, from shaping


potential projects to building and shipping them. First, the appetite


constrains what kind of a solution we design during the shaping

process. Later, when we hand the work to a team, the fixed time box


pushes them to make decisions about what is core to the project


and what is peripheral or unnecessary.

##### “Good” is relative

There’s no absolute definition of “the best” solution. The best is


relative to your constraints. Without a time limit, there’s always a


better version. The ultimate meal might be a ten course dinner. But


when you’re hungry and in a hurry, a hot dog is perfect.


The amount of time we set for our appetite is going to lead us to dif­


ferent solutions. We could model a whole set of database columns

in the fancy version, or just provide a flat textarea in the simple


version. We could redesign the main landing page to accommo­


date a new feature, or we could push it back to a screen with fewer


**3 0**


design constraints. We can only judge what is a “good” solution in


the context of how much time we want to spend and how important


it is.

##### Responding to raw ideas


Our default response to any idea that comes up should be: “In­

teresting. Maybe some day.” In other words, a very soft “no” that


leaves all our options open. We don’t put it in a backlog. We give


it space so we can learn whether it’s really important and what it


might entail.


It’s too early to say “yes” or “no” on first contact. Even if we’re


excited about it, we shouldn’t make a commitment that we don’t


yet understand. We need to do work on the idea before it’s shaped


enough to bet resources on. If we always say “yes” to incoming


requests we’ll end up with a giant pile of work that only grows.


It’s important to keep a cool manner and a bit of a poker face. We


don’t want to shut down an idea that we don’t understand. New in­

formation might come in tomorrow that makes us see it differently.


On the other hand, showing too much enthusiasm right away can


set expectations that this thing is going to happen. We may not be


able to commit to it once we’ve put it into context with everything


else we want to do.

##### Narrow down the problem


In addition to setting the appetite, we usually need to narrow down


our understanding of the problem.


We once had a customer ask us for more complex permission


rules. It could easily have taken six weeks to build the change she


wanted. Instead of taking the request at face value, we dug deeper.


C H A P T E R 3 - S e t B o u n d a r i e s **3 1**


It turned out that someone had archived a file without knowing the

file would disappear for everyone else using the system. Instead of


creating a rule to prevent some people from archiving, we realized


we could put a warning on the archive action itself that explains


the impact. That’s a one-day change instead of a six-week project.


Another example is the “calendar view” from the previous chapter.


Everyone knows what a calendar view is. But unpacking it revealed

tons of unknowns and decisions that would drastically affect the


scope. If we only want to spend six weeks instead of six months


building a huge calendar, how do we narrow it down?


In that case we flip from asking “What could we build?” to “What’s


really going wrong?” Sure, a calendar sounds nice. But what is

driving the request? At what point specifically does someone’s

current workflow break down without this thing they’re asking for?

##### Case study: Defining “calendar”


In the case of the calendar request, we called a customer who asked


for this feature. Instead of asking her why she wants a calendar and


what it should look like, we asked her _when_ she wanted a calendar.


What was she doing when the thought occurred to ask for it?


She told us she worked in an office with a big calendar drawn on a

chalkboard wall. Her officemates marked when they were meeting


clients in the handful of meeting rooms on the calendar. One


day she was working from home. A client called and asked her to

schedule a meeting. She had to drive to the office to look at the wall

calendar. Traffic was terrible along the way, and in the end there


wasn’t a free space that worked for her client. She could have saved

an hour in traffic and a lot of frustration if she had been able to


check for open spots on the calendar from her computer at home.



**3 2**


The insight wasn’t “computerize the calendar”—that’s obvious.


What we learned was that “see free spaces” was the important


thing for this use case, not “do everything a calendar does.”


This story, and others like it, gave us a specific baseline to design


against. Basecamp had an agenda view of events. It worked for


listing major deadlines and milestones but it wasn’t good for re­


source scheduling because you couldn’t see empty spaces on it. We


narrowed down the need from “do everything a calendar does” to

“help me see free spaces so I can figure out when to


schedule something.”


We didn’t have a solution yet. But now we felt like we had a

problem that was specific enough to spark an idea that could fit


within our appetite. This led us to the simpler “Dot Grid” concept


from the last chapter.


What if we can’t figure out a specific pain point or use case? Our


appetite can also tell us how much research is worthwhile. If it’s


not critical now and we can’t get our hands around the problem,


we’ll walk away from it and work on something else. Maybe in the


future a new request or story will pop up that gives us better insight


into the problem.

##### Watch out for grab-bags

When it comes to unclear ideas, the worst offenders are “rede­


signs” or “refactorings” that aren’t driven by a single problem or


use case. When someone proposes something like “redesign the


Files section,” that’s a grab-bag, not a project. It’s going to be very

hard to figure out what it means, where it starts, and where it ends.


Here’s a more productive starting point: “We need to rethink the

Files section because sharing multiple files takes too many steps.”


C H A P T E R 3 - S e t B o u n d a r i e s **3 3**


Now we can start asking: What’s not working? In what context are


there too many steps? What parts of the existing design can stay the


same and what parts need to change?


A tell-tale sign of a grab-bag is the “2.0” label. We made the mistake

in the past of kicking off a “Files 2.0” project without really consid­


ering what that meant. Our excitement about improving a huge part


of our app got the better of us. We know there were a lot of prob­


lems with our Files feature, but we didn’t ask ourselves what spe­

cifically we were going to do. The project turned out to be a mess


because we didn’t know what “done” looked like. We recovered by

splitting the project into smaller projects, like “Better file previews”


and “Custom folder colors.” We set appetites and clear expectations


on each project and shipped them successfully.

##### Boundaries in place


When we have all three things—a raw idea, an appetite, and a

narrow problem definition—we’re ready to move to the next step

and define the elements of a solution.



**3 4**


### **Find the Elements**

Now that we have the constraints of an appetite and the problem


we’re solving, it’s time to get from an idea in words to the elements

of a software solution. There could be dozens of different ways to


approach the solution for a problem. So it’s important that we can

move fast and cover a lot of different ideas without getting


dragged down.

##### Move at the right speed


Two things enable us to move at the right speed at this stage.


First, we need to have the right people—or nobody—in the room.


Either we’re working alone or with a trusted partner who can keep


pace with us. Someone we can speak with in shorthand, who has


the same background knowledge, and who we can be frank with as


we jump between ideas.


Second, we need to avoid the wrong level of detail in the drawings


C H A P T E R 4 - F i n d t h e E l e m e n t s **3 5**


and sketches. If we start with wireframes or specific visual layouts,


we’ll get stuck on unnecessary details and we won’t be able to


explore as broadly as we need to.


The challenge here is to be concrete enough to make progress on

a specific solution without getting dragged down into fine details.


The questions we’re trying to answer are:


- Where in the current system does the new thing fit?


- How do you get to it?


- What are the key components or interactions?


- Where does it take you?


To stay on the right level of detail and capture our thoughts as


they come, we work by hand using a couple of prototyping tech­


niques: breadboarding and fat marker sketches. These allow us to

quickly draw different versions of entire flows so we can debate the


pros and cons of each approach and stay aligned with what we’re


talking about as we go.

##### Breadboarding


We borrow a concept from electrical engineering to help us design


at the right level of abstraction. A breadboard is an electrical engi­


neering prototype that has all the components and wiring of a real


device but no industrial design.



**3 6**


Deciding to include an indicator light and a rotary knob is very dif­


ferent from debating the chassis material, whether the knob should

go to the left of the light or the right, how sharp the corners should


be, and so on.


Similarly, we can sketch and discuss the key components and con­


nections of an interface idea without specifying a particular visual


design. To do that, we can use a simple shorthand. There are three


basic things we’ll draw:


1. Places: These are things you can navigate to, like


screens, dialogs, or menus that pop up.


2. Affordances: These are things the user can act on, like

buttons and fields. We consider interface copy to

be an affordance, too. Reading it is an act that gives


the user information for subsequent actions.


3. Connection lines: These show how the affor­


dances take the user from place to place.


We’ll use words for everything instead of pictures. The important


things are the components we’re identifying and their connections.


They allow us to play out an idea and judge if the sequence of


actions serves the use case we’re trying to solve.


_**Example**_


Suppose our product is an invoicing tool. We’re considering adding


a new “Autopay” feature to enable our customers’ customers to pay


future invoices automatically.


How do you turn Autopay on? What’s involved? We can pick a start­


ing point and say that the customer landed on an invoice. That’s


C H A P T E R 4 - F i n d t h e E l e m e n t s **3 7**


our first place. We draw it by writing the name of the place and


underlining it.


On the invoice, we’re thinking we could add a new button to “Turn

on Autopay.” That’s an affordance. Affordances go below the line to


indicate they can be found at that place.


Where does that button go? Some place for setting up the Autopay.


We don’t have to specify whether it’s a separate screen or a pop up


modal or what. From a what’s-connected-to-what standpoint (the


topology) it’s all the same. Let’s draw a connection line from the


button to the Setup Autopay screen.


Now we can talk about what belongs on that screen. Do we ask for

a credit card here? Is there a card on file already? What about ACH


or other payment methods?


Just figuring out what to write under the bar starts to provoke



**3 8**


debates and discussions about what to build.


As we think it through, we decide we should ask for credit card

details here and show the logo of the financial institution (an

aspect of the domain in this specific product).


Straightforward enough. But wait — did we actually pay the origi­


nal invoice or not? Hm. Now we have both functional and interface


questions. What does enabling Autopay actually do? Does it apply

only for the future or does paying with Autopay the first time also


pay the current invoice? And where do we explain this behavior?


We’re starting to have deeper questions and discussions prompted


by just a few words and arrows in the breadboard.


Since we’re using such a lightweight notation, and we aren’t


bogged down with wireframes, we can quickly jump around and

entertain different possibilities.


We could add an option to the Setup screen…


C H A P T E R 4 - F i n d t h e E l e m e n t s **3 9**


But now we’re complicating the responsibilities of the confirma­


tion screen. We’re going to need to show a receipt if you pay your

balance now. Should the confirmation have a condition to some­


times show a receipt of the amount just paid?


How about an entirely different approach. Instead of starting on


an Invoice, we make Autopay an option when making a payment.


This way there’s no ambiguity about whether the current amount is


being paid. We could add an extra “Autopay was enabled” callout

to the existing payment confirmation page.


Sketching this out reminded us that the current payment form sup­

ports ACH in addition to credit card. We discuss and confirm that


we can use ACH too.


What about after Autopay is enabled? How does the customer turn

it off? Up to this point, many customers in the system didn’t have


usernames or passwords. They followed tokenized links to pay the


invoices one by one. One might naturally assume that now that the


customer has something like Autopay, they need a username and


password and some landing place to go manage it.


The team in this case decided that adding the username/password



**4 0**


flows was too much scope for their appetite at the time. Reflecting


strategically on what they knew about their customers, they thought


it would be quite alright if the invoicer’s customers had to reach out

to the invoicer and ask them to turn off the Autopay. In that case we


could add a single option to disable Autopay in the customer detail

page that we already offered to invoicers. We drew out the flow


like this:


This example illustrates the level of thinking and the speed of


movement to aim for during the breadboarding phase. Writing out

the flows confronts us with questions we didn’t originally think of


and stimulates design ideas without distracting us with unimport­


ant visual choices.


Once we get to a place where we play through the use case and the

flow seems like a fit, we’ve got the elements we need to move on to

start defining the project more clearly. We’re getting more concrete


while still leaving out a huge amount of detail.

##### Fat marker sketches


Sometimes the idea we have in mind is a visual one. Breadboarding


would just miss the point because the 2D arrangement of elements


is the fundamental problem. In that case, we still don’t want to


C H A P T E R 4 - F i n d t h e E l e m e n t s **4 1**


waste time on wireframes or unnecessary fidelity. Instead we use


fat marker sketches.


A fat marker sketch is a sketch made with such broad strokes that

adding detail is difficult or impossible. We originally did this with


larger tipped Sharpie markers on paper. Today we also do it on


iPads with the pen size set to a large diameter.


Here’s an example. We found ourselves often creating fake to-dos


in our Basecamp to-do lists that acted as dividers. We’d create an


item like “––– Needs testing –––“ and put items below it. We had

the idea to make some kind of official divider feature in our to-do

tool to turn the workaround into a first class function of to-do lists.


We had to work out what the implications of adding a divider were.


We came up with a rough idea that adding a divider separates the


list into “loose” to-dos above the divider and “grouped” to-dos


below. Adding subsequent dividers adds more groups below the


“loose” items at the top.


**4 2**


We could add items via some affordance within each group, includ­


ing the “loose” group on top.


We were a little concerned the add buttons might break up the


gestalt of the list, and the groups might all separate too much from


the lists on the page. We talked about possibilities to place the

“add” affordance inside of a menu that we already had to the left of


each to-do item.


C H A P T E R 4 - F i n d t h e E l e m e n t s **4 3**


This notation is much less constraining than breadboards, which


has downsides. We might sketch a sidebar and get attached to a


layout element like that even though it’s not a core element. But as

long as we keep an eye on that we’re still far better off than if we get


sucked into the weeds by creating wireframes too early.


It may seem a little silly to call fat marker sketches a technique or


a tool. The reason for calling them out is we too easily skip ahead

to the wrong level of fidelity. Giving this rough early stage a name

and using a specific tool for it helps us to segment our own creative

process and make sure we aren’t jumping ahead to detail a specific

idea when we haven’t surveyed the field enough.

##### Elements are the output


In the case of the Autopay example, we ended up with some


clear elements:


- A new “use this to Autopay?” checkbox on


the existing “Pay an invoice” screen


- A “disable Autopay” option on the invoicer’s side


For the To-Do Groups project, the elements were:


- Loose to-dos above the first group belong directly to the parent


- Grouped to-dos appear below the loose to-dos


- We’d like to try an _add_ affordance within each section, but


if that doesn’t work visually, we’re ok with relying on


the action menu for inserting to-dos into position.



**4 4**


Similarly, when we sketched the simplified solution for rendering


events on a calendar grid, we used the fat marker approach.


This enabled us to work out the main elements of the solution:


- A 2-up monthly calendar grid


- Dots for events, no spanned pills


- Agenda-style list of events below that scrolls


an event into view when you tap a dot


This list of elements is extremely narrow and specific compared


to “monthly calendar.” Exactly the kind of narrowing we hope to


accomplish through the shaping process.


C H A P T E R 4 - F i n d t h e E l e m e n t s **4 5**


##### Room for designers

Later, when it’s time to involve a designer, you don’t want to have to


say “I know I drew it like this but ignore that…”. Regardless of what

you say, any specific mockups are going to bias what other people

do after you—especially if you’re in a higher position than them.


They’ll take every detail in the initial mockups as direction even


though you didn’t intend it.


Working at the right “level of abstraction” not only ensures we


move at the right speed, it also leaves this important room for cre­


ativity in the later stages.


By leaving details out, the breadboard and fat marker methods give


room to designers in subsequent phases of the project.


This is a theme of the shaping process. We’re making the project

more specific and concrete, but still leaving lots of space for deci­


sions and choices to be made later. This isn’t a spec. It’s more like

the boundaries and rules of a game. It could go in countless differ­


ent ways once it’s time to play.

##### Not deliverable yet


This step of shaping is still very much in your private sphere. It’s


normal for the artifacts at this point — on the wall or in your note­


book — to be more or less indecipherable to anybody who wasn’t


there with you.


We’ve gone from a cloudy idea, like “autopay” or “to-do groups,”

to a specific approach and a handful of concrete elements. But the


form we have is still very rough and mostly in outline.


What we’ve done is landed on an approach for how to solve the



**4 6**


problem. But there may be some significant unknowns or things we

need to address before we’d consider this safe to hand off to a team


to build successfully.


The next step is to do some stress-testing and de-risking. We want


to check for holes and challenges that could hinder the project from

shipping within the fixed time appetite that we have in mind for it.


After that we’ll see how to wrap up the shaped concept into a


write-up for pitching.

##### No conveyor belt


Also keep in mind that, at this stage, we could walk away from the


project. We haven’t bet on it. We haven’t made any commitments or


promises about it. What we’ve done is added value to the raw idea


by making it more actionable. We’ve gotten closer to a good option


that we can later lobby for when it’s time to allocate resources.


C H A P T E R 4 - F i n d t h e E l e m e n t s **4 7**


### **Risks and Rabbit Holes**

Remember that we’re shaping work for a fixed time window. We

may trust from our experience that the elements we fleshed out in


the previous chapter are buildable within the appetite (six weeks).


But we need to look closer, because all it takes is one hole in the


concept to derail that. Suppose we bet on the project and a team


takes it on. If they run into an unanticipated problem that takes


two weeks to solve, they just burned a third of the budget!


Even worse, sometimes you run into problems that don’t just delay


the project—they have no apparent solution. We once bet on a


project to redesign the way we present projects with clients on

Basecamp’s home screen. We assumed the designer would figure it


out; we didn’t do the work in the shaping phase to validate that a


viable approach existed. Once the project started, it turned out to


be a much harder problem than we expected. None of us were able

to find a suitable design solution within the six weeks we budgeted.


We ended up abandoning the project and rethinking it later.



**4 8**


Of course there will always be unknowns. That’s why we apply the


many practices in Part Three so that teams tackle the right prob­


lems in the right order, leaving room for the unexpected. But that

doesn’t mean we shouldn’t look for the pitfalls we _can_ find up front


and eliminate them before betting on the project. Before we con­


sider it safe to bet on, a shaped project should be as free of holes


as possible.

##### Different categories of risk


In terms of risk, well-shaped work looks like a thin-tailed probabil­


ity distribution. There’s a slight chance it could take an extra week

but, beyond that, the elements of the solution are defined enough


and familiar enough that there’s no reason it should drag on longer


than that.


However, if there are any rabbit holes in the shaping—technical un­


knowns, unsolved design problems, or misunderstood interdepen­


dencies—the project could take _multiple times_ the original appetite


to complete. The right tail stretches out.


C H A P T E R 5 - R i s k s a n d R a b b i t H o l e s **4 9**


We want to remove the unknowns and tricky problems from the


project so that our probability is as thin-tailed as possible. That


means a project with independent, well-understood parts that


assemble together in known ways.

##### Look for rabbit holes


Fleshing out the elements of the solution was a fast-moving, ex­


ploratory process. It was more breadth than depth. In this step, we


slow down and look critically at what we came up with. Did we miss


anything? Are we making technical assumptions that aren’t fair?


One way to analyze the solution is to walk through a use case in


slow motion. Given the solution we sketched, how exactly would


a user get from the starting point to the end? Slowing down and


playing it out can reveal gaps or missing pieces that we need


to design.


Then we should also question the viability of each part we think we


solved. We ask ourselves questions like:


- Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?


- Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?



**5 0**


- Are we assuming a design solution exists that


we couldn’t come up with ourselves?


- Is there a hard decision we should settle in


advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?

##### Case study: Patching a hole

For example, when we defined the To-Do Groups project, we intro­


duced the idea of dividers in the to-do list:


We liked the idea of the dividers, and the logic of loose versus


grouped to-dos made sense to us. But when we looked closer we


realized that we didn’t address how to display completed items. In


the pre-existing design, the latest few completed items displayed


below the list. Should we now render completed items at the


bottom of each group instead of the list? Or should we continue to


show completed items at the bottom, and repeat the same set of


dividers within the completed items section? Should we reconsider


how we handle completed items entirely?


C H A P T E R 5 - R i s k s a n d R a b b i t H o l e s **5 1**


This was a hole in the concept. If we didn’t address it, we’d be


pushing a deep design problem down to the team and unreason­

ably asking them to find a solution under deadline. It’s not respon­


sible to give the team a tangled knot of interdependencies and then

ask them to untangle it within a short fixed time window.


We knew from experience that changing the way completed to-dos


render has lots of complicated implications in user experience, navi­


gation, and performance. To remove uncertainty in the project, we


decided to dictate a solution in the shaped concept. We would leave


the completed items exactly as they worked previously. Instead of


grouping or segmenting them, we would just append the name of


the group to each completed item. It would be a little messy, but we

justified the trade-off: it drastically simplified the problem, and we


could still show completed items from a group on the group’s


detail page.



**5 2**


This is the kind of trade-off that’s difficult to make when you’re


working inside the cycle under pressure. There are lots of reasons

why a different design or a deeper reconsideration of completed


to-dos would be objectively better. Why not try rendering them


inside each group? A designer could reasonably think, “Maybe if I


experiment with the styling a little more I can make them blend in


better.” They could easily waste a few days of the very few weeks


they have going down a dead end.


As shapers, we’re thinking less about the ultimate design and more


about basic quality and risk. With the compromised concept we


get to keep all the elements that made the project worth doing—the

groups of incomplete items—and we get to cut off a big tail of risk.


Next, when we write the pitch for this project, we’ll point out this

specific “patch” as part of the concept. That way nobody down the


line will get tripped up on it.

##### Declare out of bounds


Since everyone on the team wants to do their best work, they will of


course look for all the use cases to cover and consider them neces­


sary. As the team gets more comfortable with scope hammering (see


Decide When to Stop), this improves. But it’s still a good idea to call

out any cases you specifically _aren’t_ supporting to keep the project


well within the appetite.


For example, we worked on an idea for notifying groups of people

in Basecamp. Rather than checking off five programmers one by


one, you could just click “Programmers” and they’d be selected

for notification. As we looked at the product, we saw tons of places


where this kind of behavior might make sense. If we let you choose


a group when posting a message, why not when assigning a to-do,


C H A P T E R 5 - R i s k s a n d R a b b i t H o l e s **5 3**


or mentioning people in the chat room?


We decided for the purpose of the project that the core value was


narrowing down who to notify about a message. We explicitly

marked off the other cases as “out of bounds” for the project and

focused on the win we wanted: a faster flow for posting messages.

##### Cut back


There may be parts of the solution we got excited about during the


sketching phase that aren’t really necessary. When we designed the


To-Do Groups feature, we thought it would be great to color-code


groups. No doubt the page would look more interesting with col­


or-coded group labels, and the feature might be more useful too.

But we decided to flag this as unnecessary and cut it from the core


of the project. We could mention it to the team as a nice-to-have,


but everyone should start from the assumption that the feature is


valuable without it.

##### Present to technical experts


Up to this point shaping has been a closed-door activity. Before


you’re ready to write up the idea to share more widely, you might


need input on some parts of the concept you aren’t completely sure


about. There may be a technical assumption that you need to verify


with someone who understands the code better. Or perhaps you


want to make sure that usage data doesn’t contradict an assump­


tion you’re making about current customer behavior.


This is a good time to grab some technical experts and walk


them through the idea. Communicate that this is just an idea. It’s


something you’re shaping as a potential bet, not something that’s


coming down the pipe yet. The mood is friendly-conspiratorial:



**5 4**


“Here’s something I’m thinking about… but I’m not ready to show


anybody yet… what do you think?”


Beware the simple question: “Is this possible?” In software, ev­

erything is possible but nothing is free. We want to find out if it’s


possible within the appetite we’re shaping for. Instead of asking “is


it possible to do X?” ask “is X possible in 6-weeks?” That’s a very

different question.


Talk through the constraints of how this is a good solution given


the appetite, so they’re partners in keeping the project at the size


you intend. And emphasize that you’re looking for risks that could


blow up the project. It’s not just a “what do you think” conversa­


tion—we’re really hunting for time bombs that might blow up the


project once it’s committed to a team.


Try to keep the clay wet. Rather than writing up a document or


creating a slideshow, invite them to a whiteboard and redraw the


elements as you worked them out earlier, building up the concept


from the beginning. Stick completely to the concept you already


worked out to get feedback on the work you’ve already done. Then


once you’ve covered the work you already did, open it up and invite


them to suggest revisions. Having seen this concept, do they have


any insights about how to drastically simplify or approach the

problem differently?


Depending on how the conversation goes, you may either have val­


idated your approach or discovered some problems that send you


back for another round of shaping.

##### De-risked and ready to write up

At the end of this stage, we have the elements of the solution,


patches for potential rabbit holes, and fences around areas we’ve


declared out of bounds. We’ve gone from a roughly formed solution


with potential risk in it to a solid idea that we now hope to bet on in


the future.


That means we’re ready to make the transition from privately


shaping and getting feedback from an inner-circle to presenting the


idea at the betting table. To do that, we write it up in a form that


communicates the boundaries and spells out the solution so that


people with less context will be able to understand and evaluate it.


This “pitch” will be the document that we use to lobby for resources,


collect wider feedback if necessary, or simply capture the idea for


when the time is more ripe in the future.


**5 6**


### **Write the Pitch**

We’ve got the elements of a solution now, and we’ve de-risked our

concept to the point that we’re confident it’s a good option to give a


team. But the concept is still in our heads or in some hard-to-deci­


pher drawings on the whiteboard or our notebook. Now we need to


put the concept into a form that other people will be able to under­


stand, digest, and respond to.


This is where we say “Okay, this is ready to write up as a pitch.” In


this chapter, we’ll walk through the ingredients of a pitch and show


some fully worked out examples from real projects at Basecamp.


The purpose of the pitch is to present a good potential bet. It’s basi­


cally a presentation. The ingredients are all the things that we need


to both capture the work done so far and present it in a form that


will enable the people who schedule projects to make an


informed bet.


C H A P T E R 6 - W r i t e t h e P i t c h **5 7**


There are five ingredients that we always want to include in a pitch:


1. **Problem** — The raw idea, a use case, or something


we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this


2. **Appetite** — How much time we want to spend


and how that constrains the solution


3. **Solution** — The core elements we came up with, presented


in a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand


4. **Rabbit holes** — Details about the solution


worth calling out to avoid problems


5. **No-gos** — Anything specifically excluded from the concept:


functionality or use cases we intentionally aren’t cover­

ing to fit the appetite or make the problem tractable

##### Ingredient 1. Problem


It’s critical to always present both a problem and a solution to­

gether. It sounds like an obvious point but it’s surprising how often


teams, our own included, jump to a solution with the assumption


that it’s obvious why it’s a good idea to build this thing.


Diving straight into “what to build”—the solution—is dangerous.


You don’t establish any basis for discussing whether this solution


is good or bad without a problem. “Add tabs to the iPad app” might


be attractive to UI designers, but what’s to prevent the discussion

from devolving into a long debate about different UI approaches?

Without a specific problem, there’s no test of fitness to judge


whether one solution is better than the other.


Establishing the problem also lets us have a clearer conversation


later when it’s time to pitch the idea or bet on it. The solution might



**5 8**


be perfect, but what if the problem only happens to customers who

are known to be a poor fit to the product? We could spend six weeks

on an ingenious solution that only benefits a small percentage of


customers known to have low retention. We want to be able to sep­


arate out that discussion about the demand so we don’t spend time

on a good solution that doesn’t benefit the right people.


How far you have to go to spell out the problem will depend on


how much context you share with the people reading the write-up.

The best problem definition consists of a single specific story that


shows why the status quo doesn’t work. This gives you a base­

line to test fitness against. People will be able to weigh the solu­

tion against this specific problem—or other solutions if a debate


ensues—and judge whether or not that story has a better outcome


with the new solution swapped in.

##### Ingredient 2. Appetite

You can think of the appetite as another part of the problem defini­


tion. Not only do we want to solve this use case, we want to come


up with a way to do it in six weeks, not three months, or—in the


case of a small batch project—two weeks, not the whole six weeks.


Stating the appetite in the pitch prevents unproductive conversa­


tions. There’s always a better solution. The question is, if we only

care enough to spend two weeks on this now, how does _this specific_


_solution_ look?


Anybody can suggest expensive and complicated solutions. It takes

work and design insight to get to a simple idea that fits in a small


time box. Stating the appetite and embracing it as a constraint


turns everyone into a partner in that process.


C H A P T E R 6 - W r i t e t h e P i t c h **5 9**


##### Ingredient 3. Solution

Like solutions with no problems, sometimes companies bet on

problems with no solution. “We really need to make it easier to find


things on the messages section. Customers are complaining


about it.”


That’s not ready to pitch or bet on. A problem without a solution is


unshaped work. Giving it to a team means pushing research and


exploration down to the wrong level, where the skillsets, time limit,

and risk profile (thin vs. heavy tailed) are all misaligned.


If the solution isn’t there, someone should go back and do the


shaping work on the shaping track. It’s only ready to bet on when


problem, appetite, and solution come together. Then you can scru­

tinize the fit between problem and solution and judge whether it’s a


good bet or not.

##### Help them see it


During the elements phase, it was critical to sketch ideas at the


right level of abstraction so we didn’t slow down or lose any of the


ideas appearing at the corners of our brains and tips of our tongues.


We also need to draw at the right level of detail when we write the

pitch. Here the challenge is a little different. We have time to slow


down and prepare a proper presentation. We need to stay high level,


but add a little more concreteness than when we worked alone or


with a partner. People who read the pitch and look at the drawings


without much context need to “get” the idea.


We need more concreteness, but we don’t want to over-specify the

design with wireframes or high-fidelity mocks. They’ll box in the


designers who do the work later. We also risk side-tracking the



**6 0**


discussion into topics like color, proportions, or layout that have


nothing to do with the actual shaping work we did.


At the same time, hand-written breadboards have a “you had to be


there” quality to them. To people who didn’t watch the breadboard


unfold step by step, it can look like a soup of words and arrows.


Therefore we need some techniques to help people see the idea


while still not going too far into irrelevant details.


_**Embedded sketches**_


Suppose your breadboard from the shaping session looked like this:


People might have trouble visualizing where these new affordances


go on the Dashboard. We could sketch a new box on the Dashboard


to make it clearer:


C H A P T E R 6 - W r i t e t h e P i t c h **6 1**


But we’re still asking people to imagine too much. It’s worth the

trade-off to go one step down into fat-marker detail here.


This makes it easier to see what the elements are and evaluate how


clearly the feature presents itself on the dashboard. The downside


is we’ve gotten into some layout decisions that would have been

nice to avoid. Designers should feel free to find a different design


than the box divided with a vertical line. We’d add a disclaimer


here in the pitch that reminds designers of the latitude they


should take.


This is an example of selectively getting into more visual detail


because we need it to sell the concept. Fortunately, we won’t need


to make as many visual decisions in other parts of the concept. This


was a “linchpin” part of the design that everybody had to see con­


cretely in order to “get” it.


_**Annotated fat marker sketches**_


Sometimes ideas are inherently visual or a little too complicated to


express in a schematic breadboard. Fat marker sketches can be very

effective in a pitch; you just need to take more care to label


them cleanly.



**6 2**


Redrawing the sketch on an iPad—still with a fat brush size—works

well. You can use different colors to separate the labels from the


material parts of the sketch.


Or you might add some call-outs to enable discussion of

specific elements.


C H A P T E R 6 - W r i t e t h e P i t c h **6 3**


##### Ingredient 4. Rabbit holes

Sometimes addressing a rabbit hole just requires a few lines of


text. For example, in the Payment Form project above, the shapers

wanted to call out a specific solution for how to create URLs. The


URLs would never live on custom domains for v1 of the project. This


is the kind of thing that’s not central to the concept, but spelling it


out patches a potential rabbit hole.

##### Ingredient 5. No Gos


Lastly if there’s anything we’re _not_ doing in this concept, it’s


good to mention it here. In the case of the Payment Form project,


the team decided up front that they wouldn’t allow any kind of


WYSIWYG editing of the form. Users would only be able to provide


a logo and customize the header text on a separate “customize”


page. WYSIWYG might be better in some peoples’ eyes, but given


the appetite it was important to mark this as a no-go.

##### Examples


Here are two examples of real pitches.



**6 4**


This pitch for grouping to-dos together starts by showing a work­


around people are using in the current design. Then it sketches out


all the main ideas for how to enable optional to-do groupings.


_Two screenshots demonstrate the problem. Fat marker sketches describe_


_the solution. Rabbit holes motivated some of the sketches._


_See full size at basecamp.com/shapeup-todo-pitch._


C H A P T E R 6 - W r i t e t h e P i t c h **6 5**


This pitch for changing how notifications work starts with two


videos to demonstrate the problem. The black boxes toward the end


are a visualization of user behavior data that supports a decision in


the pitch.


_Two videos show the problem. A fat marker sketch and a breadboard describe_

_the solution. The black boxes contain data visualizations that support trade-offs_


_in the solution. See full size at basecamp.com/shapeup-groups-pitch._



**6 6**


##### Ready to present

The next step will be to make the case that this pitch describes a bet


worth making. This can happen in a couple ways.


We prefer asynchronous communication by default and escalate to


real-time only when necessary. This gives everyone the maximum


amount of time under their own control for doing real work. That

means the first step for presenting a pitch is posting the write-up


with all the ingredients above somewhere that stakeholders can


read it on their own time. This keeps the betting table short and


productive. In ideal conditions everyone has time to read the


pitches in advance. And if that isn’t possible in some cases, the


pitch is ready to pull up for a quick live sell.

##### How we do it in Basecamp


We post pitches as Messages in Basecamp. We created a Message

Category called _Pitch_ so we can easily find them. Pitches are posted


to a Team called _Product Strategy_ that can be accessed by people on


the betting table.

_A pitch as a Message. Note the one-week appetite._


_This was a Small Batch project._


When we need to include a fat marker sketch in a pitch, we’ll draw


it on an iPad (with Notability) and take a screenshot. Basecamp’s


text editor makes it easy to insert images and caption them so they

make sense in the flow of the pitch.

**6 8**


People comment on the pitch asynchronously. Not to say yes or no


— that happens at the betting table — but to poke holes or contrib­


ute missing information.


_Our CTO responds with technical thoughts on the pitch._


In the next chapter we’ll look at the betting process in more detail


to see where pitches go and how we turn them into


scheduled projects.

##### **P A R T T W O**
## Betting


### **Bets, Not Backlogs**

Now that we’ve written a pitch, where does it go? It doesn’t go onto


a backlog.

##### No backlogs


Backlogs are a big weight we don’t need to carry. Dozens and


eventually hundreds of tasks pile up that we all know we’ll never


have time for. The growing pile gives us a feeling like we’re always


behind even though we’re not. Just because somebody thought


some idea was important a quarter ago doesn’t mean we need to


keep looking at it again and again.


Backlogs are big time wasters too. The time spent constantly


reviewing, grooming and organizing old ideas prevents everyone


from moving forward on the timely projects that really matter


right now.



**7 2**


##### A few potential bets

So what do we do instead? Before each six-week cycle, we hold


a betting table where stakeholders decide what to do in the next


cycle. At the betting table, they look at pitches from the last six


weeks — or any pitches that somebody purposefully revived and


lobbied for again.


Nothing else is on the table. There’s no giant list of ideas to review.


There’s no time spent grooming a backlog of old ideas. There are


just a few well-shaped, risk-reduced options to review. The pitches


are potential bets.


With just a few options and a six-week long cycle, these meetings


are infrequent, short, and intensely productive.


If we decide to bet on a pitch, it goes into the next cycle to build. If


we don’t, we let it go. There’s nothing we need to track or hold on to.


What if the pitch was great, but the time just wasn’t right? Anyone


who wants to advocate for it again simply tracks it independently—


their own way—and then lobbies for it six weeks later.

##### Decentralized lists


We don’t have to choose between a burdensome backlog and not re­


membering anything from the past. Everyone can still track pitches,


bugs, requests, or things they want to do independently without a


central backlog.


Support can keep a list of requests or issues that come up more

often than others. Product tracks ideas they hope to be able to


shape in a future cycle. Programmers maintain a list of bugs they’d

like to fix when they have some time. There’s no one backlog or


C H A P T E R 7 - B e t s, N o t B a c k l o g s **7 3**


central list and none of these lists are direct inputs to the


betting process.


Regular but infrequent one-on-ones between departments help


to cross-pollinate ideas for what to do next. For example, Support


can tell Product about top issues they are seeing, which Product


can then track independently as potential projects to shape. Maybe

Product picks off just one of those top issues to work on now. Then,


in a future one-on-one, Support can lobby again for something that


hasn’t yet gotten attention.


This approach spreads out the responsibility for prioritizing and

tracking what to do and makes it manageable. People from different


departments can advocate for whatever they think is important and


use whatever method works for them to track those things—or not.


This way the conversation is always fresh. Anything brought back


is brought back with a context, by a person, with a purpose. Every­


thing is relevant, timely, and of the moment.

##### Important ideas come back


It’s easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They


come up all the time and accumulate into big piles.


Really important ideas will come back to you. When’s the last time


you forgot a really great, inspiring idea? And if it’s not that inter­


esting—maybe a bug that customers are running into from time to


time—it’ll come back to your attention when a customer complains


again or a new customer hits it. If you hear it once and never again,


maybe it wasn’t really a problem. And if you keep hearing about it,


you’ll be motivated to shape a solution and pitch betting time on it


in the next cycle.



**74**


### **The Betting Table**

Now that we have some good potential bets in the form of pitches,


it’s time to make decisions about which projects to schedule.

##### Six-week cycles

Committing time and people is difficult if we can’t easily determine


who’s available and for how long. When people are available at

different times due to overlapping projects, project planning turns


into a frustrating game of Calendar Tetris. Working in cycles dras­

tically simplifies this problem. A cycle gives us a standard project


size both for shaping and scheduling.


Some companies use two-week cycles (aka “sprints”). We learned


that two weeks is too short to get anything meaningful done. Worse


than that, two-week cycles are extremely costly due to the plan­


ning overhead. The amount of work you get out of two weeks isn’t


worth the collective hours around the table to “sprint plan” or the


C H A P T E R 8 - T h e B e t t i n g T a b l e **7 5**


opportunity cost of breaking everyone’s momentum to re-group.


This led us to try longer cycles. We wanted a cycle that would be

long enough to finish a whole project, start to end. At the same time,


cycles need to be short enough to see the end from the beginning.


People need to feel the deadline looming in order to make trade
offs. If the deadline is too distant and abstract at the start, teams

will naturally wander and use time inefficiently until the deadline


starts to get closer and feel real.


After years of experimentation we arrived at six weeks. Six weeks is

long enough to finish something meaningful and still short enough


to see the end from the beginning.

##### Cool-down


If we were to run six-week cycles back to back, there wouldn’t be


any time to breathe and think about what’s next. The end of a cycle


is the worst time to meet and plan because everybody is too busy

finishing projects and making last-minute decisions in order to ship


on time.


Therefore, after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for


cool-down. This is a period with no scheduled work where we can


breathe, meet as needed, and consider what to do next.


During cool-down, programmers and designers on project teams

are free to work on whatever they want. After working hard to ship


their six-week projects, they enjoy having time that’s under their

control. They use it to fix bugs, explore new ideas, or try out new


technical possibilities.



**76**


##### Team and project sizes

In addition to standardizing the length of our cycles, we also


roughly standardize the types of projects and teams that we bet on.


Our project teams consist of either one designer and two program­


mers or one designer and one programmer. They’re joined by a QA


person who does integration testing later in the cycle.


These teams will either spend the entire cycle working on one


project, or they’ll work on multiple smaller projects during the


cycle. We call the team that spends the cycle doing one project the


big batch team and the team working on a set of smaller projects


the small batch team. Small batch projects usually run one or two


weeks each. Small batch projects aren’t scheduled individually. It’s

up to the small batch team to figure out how to juggle the work so


they all ship before the end of the cycle.


Now that we have a standard way to think about capacity, we can


talk about how we decide what to schedule.

##### The betting table


The betting table is a meeting held during cool-down where stake­


holders decide what to do in the next cycle. The potential bets to


consider are either new pitches shaped during the last six weeks, or

possibly one or two older pitches that someone specifically chose to


revive. As we said last chapter, there’s no “grooming” or backlog to


organize. Just a few good options to consider.


Our betting table at Basecamp consists of the CEO (who in our


case is the last word on product), CTO, a senior programmer, and a


product strategist (myself).


C H A P T E R 8 - T h e B e t t i n g T a b l e **7 7**


C-level time is only available in small slices, so there’s an atmo­


sphere of “waste no time” and the call rarely goes longer than an


hour or two. Everyone has had a chance to study the pitches on


their own time beforehand. Ad-hoc one-on-one conversations in


the weeks before usually establish some context too. Once the call


starts, it’s all about looking at the options that made it to the table


and making decisions.


The output of the call is a cycle plan. Between everyone present,


there’s knowledge of who’s available, what the business priorities


are, and what kind of work we’ve been doing lately. All of this feeds


into the decision-making process about what to do and who to


schedule (more on this below).


The highest people in the company are there. There’s no “step two”


to validate the plan or get approval. And nobody else can jump in

afterward to interfere or interrupt the scheduled work.


This buy-in from the very top is essential to making the cycles


turn properly. The meeting is short, the options well-shaped,


and the headcount low. When these criteria are met, the betting


table becomes a place to exercise control over the direction of the


product instead of a battle for resources or a plea for prioritization.


With cycles long enough to make meaningful progress and shaped


work that will realistically ship, the betting table gives the C-suite a


“hands on the wheel” feeling they haven’t had since the early days.

##### The meaning of a bet


We talk about “betting” instead of planning because it sets

different expectations.


First, bets have a payout. We’re not just filling a time box with tasks


**7 8**


until it’s full. We’re not throwing two weeks toward a feature and


hoping for incremental progress. We intentionally shape work into

a six-week box so there’s something meaningful finished at the end.

The pitch defines a specific payout that makes the bet


worth making.


Second, bets are commitments. If we bet six weeks, then we commit


to giving the team the entire six weeks to work exclusively on that


thing with no interruptions. We’re not trying to optimize every hour


of a programmer’s time. We’re looking at the bigger movement of

progress on the whole product after the six weeks.


Third, a smart bet has a cap on the downside. If we bet six weeks


on something, the most we can lose is six weeks. We don’t allow


ourselves to get into a situation where we’re spending multiples of


the original estimate for something that isn’t worth that price.


Let’s look at these last two points more closely.

##### Uninterrupted time


It’s not really a bet if we say we’re dedicating six weeks but then


allow a team to get pulled away to work on something else.


When you make a bet, you honor it. We do not allow the team to


be interrupted or pulled away to do other things. If people inter­


rupt the team with requests, that breaks our commitment. We’d no


longer be giving the team a whole six weeks to do work that was


shaped for six weeks of time.


When people ask for “just a few hours” or “just one day,” don’t


be fooled. Momentum and progress are second-order things, like


growth or acceleration. You can’t describe them with one point. You


need an uninterrupted curve of points. When you pull someone


C H A P T E R 8 - T h e B e t t i n g T a b l e **7 9**


away for one day to fix a bug or help a different team, you don’t


just lose a day. You lose the momentum they built up and the time


it will take to gain it back. Losing the wrong hour can kill a day.


Losing a day can kill a week.


What if something comes up during that six weeks? We still don’t


interrupt the team and break the commitment. The maximum


time we’d have to wait is six weeks before being able to act on the


new problem or idea. If the cycle passes and that thing is still the


most important thing to do, we can bet on it for that cycle. This is


why it’s so important to only bet one cycle ahead. This keeps our


options open to respond to these new issues. And of course, if it’s a


real crisis, we can always hit the brakes. But true crises are


very rare.

##### The circuit breaker


We combine this uninterrupted time with a tough but extremely


powerful policy. Teams have to ship the work within the amount of

time that we bet. If they don’t finish, by default the project doesn’t


get an extension. We intentionally create a risk that the project—as


pitched—won’t happen. This sounds severe but it’s extremely


helpful for everyone involved.


First, it eliminates the risk of runaway projects. We defined our


appetite at the start when the project was shaped and pitched. If


the project was only worth six weeks, it would be foolish to spend


two, three or ten times that. Very few projects are of the “at all


costs” type and absolutely must happen now. We think of this like a


circuit breaker that ensures one project doesn’t overload the system.


One project that’s taking too long will never freeze us or get in the


way of new projects that could be more important.



**8 0**


Second, if a project doesn’t finish in the six weeks, it means we did


something wrong in the shaping. Instead of investing more time


in a bad approach, the circuit breaker pushes us to reframe the


problem. We can use the shaping track on the next six weeks to


come up with a new or better solution that avoids whatever rabbit

hole we fell into on the first try. Then we’ll review the new pitch


at the betting table to see if it really changes our odds of success


before dedicating another six weeks to it.


Finally, the circuit breaker motivates teams to take more ownership


over their projects. As we’ll see in the next chapter, teams are given


full responsibility for executing projects. That includes making

trade-offs about implementation details and choosing where to cut


scope. You can’t ship without making hard decisions about where


to stop, what to compromise, and what to leave out. A hard dead­


line and the chance of not shipping motivates the team to regularly

question how their design and implementation decisions are affect­


ing the scope.

##### What about bugs?


If the teams aren’t interrupted in the six week cycle, how do we


handle bugs that come up?


First we should step back and question our assumptions about bugs.


There is nothing special about bugs that makes them automatically


more important than everything else. The mere fact that something


is a bug does not give us an excuse to interrupt ourselves or other

people. All software has bugs. The question is: how severe are


they? If we’re in a real crisis—data is being lost, the app is grind­


ing to a halt, or a huge swath of customers are seeing the wrong

thing—then we’ll drop everything to fix it. But _crises are rare_ . The


C H A P T E R 8 - T h e B e t t i n g T a b l e **8 1**


vast majority of bugs can wait six weeks or longer, and many don’t

even need to be fixed. If we tried to eliminate every bug, we’d never

be done. You can’t ship anything new if you have to fix the whole

world first.


That said, nobody likes bugs. We still want ways to deal with them.


Three strategies have worked for us.


1. **Use cool-down** . Ask any programmer if there are things

they wish they could go back and fix and they’ll have a


list to show you. The cool-down period between cycles


gives them time to do exactly that. Six weeks is not long


to wait for the majority of bugs, and two weeks every six

weeks actually adds up to a lot of time for fixing them.


2. **Bring it to the betting table** . If a bug is too big to fix during


cool-down, it can compete for resources at the betting table.


Suppose a back-end process is slowing the app down and a


programmer wants to change it from a synchronous step to an

asynchronous job. The programmer can make the case for fixing


it and shape the solution in a pitch. Then instead of interrupting


other work, the people at the betting table can make a deliber­


ate decision. Time should always be used strategically. There’s

a huge difference between delaying other work to fix a bug

versus deciding up front that the bug is worth the time to fix.


3. **Schedule a bug smash** . Once a year—usually around the holi­

days—we’ll dedicate a whole cycle to fixing bugs. We call it a “bug


smash.” The holidays are a good time for this because it’s hard


to get a normal project done when people are traveling or taking

time off. The team can self-organize to pick off the most important


bugs and solve long-standing issues in the front-end or back-end.



**8 2**


##### Keep the slate clean

The key to managing capacity is giving ourselves a clean slate with


every cycle. That means only betting one cycle at a time and never

carrying scraps of old work over without first shaping and consider­


ing them as a new potential bet.


It is crucial to maximize our options in the future. We don’t know


what will happen in the next six weeks. We don’t know what bril­


liant idea will emerge or what urgent request might appear.


Even if we have some kind of road map in our heads at the time


scale above cycles, we keep it in our heads and in our side-channel


discussions. Each six weeks we learn what’s working and what


isn’t, what’s important and what’s not. There’s no downside to


keeping the option open and massive upside from being available


to act on the unexpected.


What about projects that just can’t be done in one cycle? In that


case we still only bet six weeks at a time. Suppose we envision a


feature that takes two cycles to ship. We reduce our risk dramat­

ically by shaping a specific six week target, with something fully


built and working at the end of that six weeks. If that goes as


expected, we’ll feel good about betting the next six weeks the way

we envisioned in our heads. But if it doesn’t, we could define a very

different project. Or we could put the multi-cycle thing on pause


and do something urgent that came up. The important thing is that


we always shape what the end looks like for that cycle and that we


keep our options open to change course.

### **Place Your Bets**

##### Look where you are

Depending on whether we’re improving an existing product or

building a new product, we’re going to set different expectations


about what happens during the six-week cycle.


This invites us to reflect on where we are in the arc of our product’s


development and bet accordingly.

##### Existing products


When we add features to an existing product, we follow the stan­


dard Shape Up process: shape the work, bet on it, and give it to a

team to build. We expect the team to finish and ship some version


of the shaped work by the end of the cycle.


On an existing product, all of the existing code and design that _isn’t_

going to change defines a kind of empty space that the new feature

will fit into. Shaping and building is like crafting a piece of furni­


ture for a house that is already built.

##### New products

New products are different. Whereas adding to an existing product

is like buying a couch for a room with fixed dimensions, new

product development is like figuring out where the walls and the


foundation should go so the building will stand.


We’ve noticed three phases of work when we build a new product


from scratch. In each phase, the way that we shape and our expec­


tations for how the team will work together during the cycle are



**8 4**


different. These phases unfold over the course of multiple cycles,


but we still only bet one cycle at a time.

##### R&D mode


At the very earliest stages of a new product, our idea is just a theory


or a glimmer. We don’t know if the bundle of features we imagine


will hold together in reality, and the technical decisions about how


to model them in code are even less clear.


This means there is a lot of scrapwork. We might decide half-way


to standing up a feature that it’s not what we want and try another


approach instead.


In other words, we can’t reliably shape what we want in advance

and say: “This is what we want. We expect to ship it after six


weeks.” We have to learn what we want by building it.


We call this stage R&D mode and adjust for it in three ways.


1. Instead of betting on a well-shaped pitch, we mainly bet the


_time_ on spiking some key pieces of the new product idea. The


shaping is much fuzzier because we expect to learn by building.


2. Rather than delegating to a separate build team, our senior


people make up the team. David (CTO) takes the program­


ming role and works with Jason (CEO and designer) or a senior


designer with Jason’s guidance. This is necessary for two


reasons. First, you can’t delegate to other people when you


don’t know what you want yourself. Second, the architectural


decisions will determine what’s possible in the product’s

future — they define the “holes” that future features fit into. At


this phase the team needs to hold the vision of the product

and be able to judge the long-term effects of design decisions.


C H A P T E R 9 - P l a c e Y o u r B e t s **8 5**


3. Lastly, we don’t expect to ship anything at the end of an R&D


cycle. The aim is to spike, not to ship. In the best case we’ll


have some UI and code committed to serve as the foundation


for subsequent work. The goal is to learn what works so we can


commit to some load-bearing structure: the main code and UI

decisions that will define the form of the product going forward.


We can’t ship anything to customers with just a single cycle of R&D


work. But we still don’t commit to more than one cycle at a time.

We may learn from the first cycle that we aren’t ready to tackle the


product yet. Or we may discover that our intuition rang true and


the product is coming together. Depending on how it goes, we’ll


decide cycle-by-cycle whether to continue spending informal time


in R&D mode.

##### Production mode

If we continue to get warmer after some R&D cycles, we’ll eventu­


ally reach a point where the most important architectural decisions

are settled. The product does those few essential things that define


it, and the foundation is laid for the dozens of other things we’ll


have to do before we can ship to customers.


With this structure in place, the senior team can bring in other

people to contribute. This is the flip to production mode, where we


work in formal cycles with clear-cut shaping, betting, and building


phases. Production mode is like working on an existing product: the


precedent set by the R&D work enables new contributors to identify

where new functionality belongs and how it fits into the whole.


In production mode:


1. Shaping is deliberate again. The shaped work describes


**8 6**


what we expect to see at the end of the cycle.


2. The team that builds the projects is no longer limited to the


senior group. It becomes possible to bet multiple teams


in parallel (if you have them) and cover more ground.


3. Shipping is the goal, not spiking. But because the product

isn’t publicly available to customers yet, we define ‘ship­

ping’ differently. Shipping means merging into the


main codebase and expecting not to touch it again.


Since we aren’t shipping to customers at the end of each cycle, we

maintain the option to remove features from the final cut before


launch. This means we can still be experimental. We can bet six

weeks on a feature without knowing if we’ll want it in the final


product. That’s not a problem as long as we set expectations to the

build team: we can’t predict what we’ll want in the final cut, and


we’re willing to risk this cycle to take our best swing at the idea.

##### Cleanup mode

In the final phase before launching the new product, we throw all


structure out the window. We call this cleanup mode. It’s a free-for

all. We’ve built enough new products to learn that there are always


things we forget, things we miss, details that aren’t right, and bugs


that creep in over the course of the R&D and production


mode cycles.


There’s something about putting your finger near the launch button


that makes your hair stand up. Everything suddenly gets “real.”


Things we dismissed before pop out at us with new importance.


That’s why we reserve some capacity at the end for the unexpected.


In cleanup mode:


C H A P T E R 9 - P l a c e Y o u r B e t s **8 7**


1. There’s no shaping. The cycle is closer in spirit to the “bug


smash” mentioned in the previous chapter. Leadership


stands at the helm throughout the cycle, calling atten­


tion to what’s important and cutting away distractions.


2. There aren’t clear team boundaries. Every­


one jumps in to help however they can.


3. Work is “shipped” (merged to the main codebase)


continuously in as small bites as possible.


Discipline is still important. We have to check ourselves to make


sure these are must-haves we’re working on, not just our cold feet


begging us to delay launch. Cleanup shouldn’t last longer than


two cycles.


Cleanup is also the phase where leadership makes those “final cut”


decisions. A smaller surface area on a V1 means fewer questions


to answer, less to support, and less we’re committing to maintain

indefinitely. Sometimes we need to see all the features working as


a whole to judge what we can live without and what might require


deeper consideration before shipping it to customers.

##### Examples


_**The Dot Grid Calendar**_


We built the Dot Grid Calendar (see Chapter 2) for Basecamp, an


existing product. We shaped the project, bet six weeks on it, a team


built it, and then we shipped it straight to customers.


_**A new product: HEY**_

In 2020, after two years of development, we launched a new email

app and service called HEY. HEY was in R&D mode for the first year



**8 8**


of its development. A team of three, Jason (CEO), David (CTO), and


Jonas (senior designer) explored a wide variety of ideas before set­


tling on the core. Nearly a year of production mode cycles followed,

where all of Basecamp’s teams fleshed out HEY’s feature set. We

ended with two cycles of cleanup and significantly cut back the


feature set to launch in July 2020.


To be precise, there was some overlap between R&D and production

mode after that first year. Basecamp was big enough as a company


that the senior team could shape and delegate production-mode


projects around parts of the app that were settled while continuing


to explore new territory in R&D mode themselves.


Every bet on HEY was placed one at a time. The betting table didn’t


know they would be working on HEY for two years during those

first few R&D cycles. Gradually they gained confidence in the idea


and grew a big-picture appetite for how many cycles they were

willing to spend on HEY. But they made no specific commitments

about what would go into those cycles. And flipping attention back


to Basecamp, our existing product, was always on the table.


_**An experimental feature: Hill Charts**_


A third example shows some grey area. When we built the Hill


Charts feature in Basecamp (see Chapter 13), we had no idea if it


was going to work out or not. Basecamp was an existing product,


and it felt too risky to bet on releasing this experimental feature


to customers. So we framed the project more like a production

mode bet on a new product. We shaped a first version that was


just functional enough to use ourselves. We didn’t expect to ship


it to customers without doing an additional cycle on it. This was a


risk: we bet one cycle, not two. If it didn’t work out, we’d scrap it. If


something more important came up, we might not ever schedule


C H A P T E R 9 - P l a c e Y o u r B e t s **8 9**


the second cycle. But we ended up feeling confident after the first


cycle. We shaped a project to round it out, decided to bet another


cycle, and then shipped it to customers.

##### Questions to ask


Here are some common questions you might hear when people at


the betting table are debating which bets to place.


_**Does the problem matter?**_


Just like in pitch write-ups, we always take care to separate problem


and solution. The solution doesn’t matter if the problem isn’t


worth solving.


Of course, any problem that affects customers matters. But we have


to make choices because there will always be more problems than


time to solve them. So we weigh problems against each other. Is _this_


problem more important than _that_ problem right now?


How the people at the table judge problems depends on their per­


spective, role, and knowledge. For example, a problem might impact


a small segment of customers but put a disproportionate burden on


support. Depending on your exposure to support and which aspect

of the business you’re focused on, you may weigh that differently.


Sometimes a solution that is too complicated or too sweeping may


invite questions about the problem. Do we really need to make so


many changes across the app? Have we understood the problem

specifically enough? Maybe there’s a way to narrow it down so that

we get 80% of the benefit from 20% of the change.


_**Is the appetite right?**_


It’s good when we have a solution shaped to a reasonable time


frame, like two or six weeks. But we might still debate whether it’s



**9 0**


worth the time. Suppose a stakeholder says they aren’t interested


in spending six weeks on a given pitch. The negotiation could go a


couple directions from there:


1. Maybe the problem wasn’t articulated well enough, and there’s


knowledge that the shaper can add to the conversation right now

to swing opinion. For example, “Yeah it doesn’t happen often, but


when it does people are so vocal about it that it really tarnishes


perception of us.” Or “Maybe it sounds trivial, but support has


to go through 11 time-consuming steps to get to resolution.”


2. Sometimes saying “no” to the time commitment is really saying


no to something else. Maybe there’s something about the solu­


tion or the technical implementation they don’t like. Asking “How


would you feel if we could do it in two weeks?” can uncover that


it’s not so much about the time. The CTO might answer, “I don’t


want to introduce another dependency into that area of the app.”


3. The shaper might just let the idea go if interest is too low.


4. The shaper might go back to the drawing table and either


work on a smaller version (for a shorter appetite) or do


more research if they believe the problem is compel­


ling but they weren’t armed well enough to present it.


_**Is the solution attractive?**_


The problem may be important and the appetite fair, but there can

be differences about the solution.


For example, adding interface elements to the screen carries an


invisible cost: giving up the real estate. A button in the corner of the


home page might perfectly solve the problem. But that real estate is


valuable. If we give it up now, we won’t be able to use it in the future.


C H A P T E R 9 - P l a c e Y o u r B e t s **9 1**


Are we selling it too cheaply to solve this particular problem?


If someone offers an immediate design solution, like “how about


we move that button to an action menu instead,” we might discuss


it. But generally we’ll avoid doing design work or discussing tech­


nical solutions for longer than a few moments at the betting table.


If we catch ourselves spending too much time in the weeds we’ll


remind ourselves “okay, we’re not doing design here” and move


back up to the high level.


_**Is this the right time?**_


The kind of project we want to do next can depend on which proj­


ects we’ve done recently. Maybe it’s been too long since we’ve made


a splash of news with a new feature. Or perhaps we’ve been build­

ing too many new features and feel overdue to fix some long-stand­


ing customer requests. Or if the teams spent the last couple cycles


in the same area of the app, their morale may dip if we plan yet


another project doing the same kind of work.


Those are all reasons that we might pass on a project even though


it’s perfectly well shaped and valuable. The project’s great; it’s just


not the right time.


_**Are the right people available?**_

As part of the betting process we choose who specifically will play

which role on each team. That is, we’ll pair a project with a specific


small team of a designer and one or two programmers. We have a


“Core Product” team of designers and programmers and we select


from that pool when planning teams for each cycle. The team will


work with each other for the whole cycle and then the next cycle

can be a different combination of people.


Different projects require different expertise. Maybe we need some


**9 2**


more front-end programming on this one. Or this other one is going


to invite a lot of scope creep so we need someone who’s good with


the scope hammer.


The type of work each person has been doing is another factor.


Someone who’s done a long string of small batch projects might


prefer to take on a big batch, or vice versa.


And lastly there’s always a little Calendar Tetris with peoples’

availability. Vacations or sabbaticals affect which projects we can


schedule in the coming cycle.


We’ve seen some other companies use a different model where


instead of assigning the projects to people, they let the team


members choose which projects they want to work on. Culturally,


we are too meeting-averse for this extra step. But we’ve heard it can


work well for some teams because the project teams have a little


more buy-in.

##### Post the kick-off message

After the bets are made, someone from the betting table will write a


message that tells everyone which projects we’re betting on for the


next cycle and who will be working on them.

##### **P A R T T H R E E**
## Building


### **Hand Over Responsibility**

We’ve made our bets and now it’s time to start the next cycle. How


does the team get started?

##### Assign projects, not tasks


We _don’t_ start by assigning tasks to anyone. Nobody plays the role


of the “taskmaster” or the “architect” who splits the project up into


pieces for other people to execute.


Splitting the project into tasks up front is like putting the pitch


through a paper shredder. Everybody just gets disconnected pieces.


We want the project to stay “whole” through the entire process so


we never lose sight of the bigger picture.


Instead, we trust the team to take on the entire project and work

within the boundaries of the pitch. The team is going to define their


own tasks and their own approach to the work. They will have full


autonomy and use their judgement to execute the pitch as best as



**9 6**


they can.


Teams love being given more freedom to implement an idea the


way they think is best. Talented people don’t like being treated like


“code monkeys” or ticket takers.


Projects also turn out better when the team is given responsibility

to look after the whole. Nobody can predict at the beginning of a


project what exactly will need to be done for all the pieces to come


together properly. What works on paper almost never works exactly


as designed in practice. The designers and programmers doing the


real work are in the best position to make changes and adjustments


or spot missing pieces.


When teams are assigned individual tasks, each person can execute


their little piece without feeling responsible for judging how all the

pieces fit together. Planning up front makes you blind to the reality


along the way.


Remember: we aren’t giving the teams absolute freedom to invent


a solution from scratch. We’ve done the shaping. We’ve set the

boundaries. Now we are going to trust the team to fill in the outline


from the pitch with real design decisions and implementation.


This is where our efforts to define the project at the right level of

abstraction—without too much detail—will pay off. With their talent


and knowledge of the particulars, the team is going to arrive at a

better finished product than we could have by trying to determine

the final form in advance.

##### Done means deployed


At the end of the cycle, the team will deploy their work. In the case


of a Small Batch team with a few small projects for the cycle, they’ll


C H A P T E R 1 0 - H a n d O v e r R e s p o n s i b i l i t y **9 7**


deploy each one as they see fit as long as it happens before the end


of the cycle.


This constraint keeps us true to our bets and respects the circuit


breaker. The project needs to be done within the time we budgeted;


otherwise, our appetite and budget don’t mean anything.


That also means any testing and QA needs to happen _within_ the

cycle. The team will accommodate that by scoping off the most

essential aspects of the project, finishing them early, and coordinat­


ing with QA. (More on that later.)


For most projects we aren’t strict about the timing of help documen­


tation, marketing updates, or announcements to customers and


don’t expect those to happen within the cycle. Those are thin-tailed


from a risk perspective (they never take 5x as long as we think they

will) and are mostly handled by other teams. We’ll often take care


of those updates and publish an announcement about the new

feature during cool-down after the cycle.

##### Kick-off


We start the project by creating a new Basecamp project and adding

the team to it. Then the first thing we’ll do is post the shaped


concept to the Message Board. We’ll either post the original pitch or


a distilled version of it.



**9 8**


_The first thing on the Basecamp project is a message with the shaped concept_


Since our teams are remote, we use the chat room in the Basecamp

project to arrange a kick-off call.


_Arranging a call with the team to walk through the shaped work_


C H A P T E R 1 0 - H a n d O v e r R e s p o n s i b i l i t y **9 9**


The call gives the team a chance to ask any important questions


that aren’t clear from the write-up. Then, with a rough understand­


ing of the project, they’re ready to get started.

##### Getting oriented

Work in the first few days doesn’t look like “work.” No one is

checking off tasks. Nothing is getting deployed. There aren’t any

deliverables to look at. Often there isn’t even much communication

between the team in the first few days. There can be an odd kind of


radio silence.


Why? Because each person has their head down trying to figure


out how the existing system works and which starting point is best.


Everyone is busy learning the lay of the land and getting oriented.


_The team figuring out where to start_



**1 0 0**


It’s important for managers to respect this phase. Teams can’t just


dive into a code base and start building new functionality imme­


diately. They have to acquaint themselves with the relevant code,


think through the pitch, and go down some short dead ends to

find a starting point. Interfering or asking them for status too early

hurts the project. It takes away time that the team needs to find the


best approach. The exploration needs to happen anyway. Asking


for visible progress will only push it underground. It’s better to

empower the team to explictly say “I’m still figuring out how to


start” so they don’t have to hide or disguise this legitimate work.


Generally speaking, if the silence doesn’t start to break after three


days, that’s a reasonable time to step in and see what’s going on.

##### Imagined vs discovered tasks


Since the team was given the project and not tasks, they need to


come up with the tasks themselves. Here we note an important

difference between tasks we _think_ we need to do at the start of a


project and the tasks we _discover_ we need to do in the course of


doing real work.


The team naturally starts off with some imagined tasks—the ones


they assume they’re going to have to do just by thinking about the


problem. Then, as they get their hands dirty, they discover all kinds


of other things that we didn’t know in advance. These unexpected


details make up the true bulk of the project and sometimes present


the hardest challenges.


Teams discover tasks by doing real work. For example, the designer


adds a new button on the desktop interface but then notices there’s


no obvious place for it on the mobile webview version. They record

a new task: figure out how to reveal the button on mobile. Or the


C H A P T E R 1 0 - H a n d O v e r R e s p o n s i b i l i t y **1 0 1**


first pass of the design has good visual hierarchy, but then the


designer realizes there needs to be more explanatory copy in a


place that disrupts the layout. Two new tasks: Change the layout to


accommodate explanatory copy; write the explanatory copy.


Often a task will appear in the process of doing something unre­


lated. Suppose a programmer is working on a database migration.


While looking at the model to understand the associations, she

might run into a method that needs to be updated for a different


part of the project later. She’s going to want to note a task to update


that method later.


**The way to really figure out what needs to be done is to start**


**doing real work.** That doesn’t mean the teams start by building


just anything. They need to pick something meaningful to build

first. Something that is central to the project while still small


enough to be done end-to-end—with working UI and working


code—in a few days.


In the next chapters we’ll look at how the team chooses that target


and works together to get a fully integrated spike working.



**1 0 2**


### **Get One Piece Done**

As the team gets oriented, they start to discover and track the tasks


they need to do to build the project. It’s important at this early


phase that they don’t create a master plan of parts that should


come together in the 11th hour. If the team completes a lot of tasks


but there’s no “one thing” to click on and try out, it’s hard to feel


progress. A team can do a lot of work but feel insecure because they


don’t have anything real to show for it yet. Lots of things are done


but nothing is _really_ done.


Instead they should aim to make something tangible and demoable

early—in the first week or so. That requires integrating vertically


on one small piece of the project instead of chipping away at the


horizontal layers.

##### Integrate one slice


We can think of projects in two layers: front-end and back-end,


C H A P T E R 1 1 - G e t O n e P i e c e D o n e **1 0 3**


design and code. While technically speaking there are more layers


than this, these two are the primary integration challenge in


most projects.


Suppose the project starts with a lot of design. The team could


design a variety of screens and even implement them as templates


or views. But until they’re wired to a backend, nothing does any­


thing. The work remains hypothetical and speculative.


Same with the backend. A lot of tasks could be checked off, but


without any UI—what can you do with it? How do you judge if the

work on a specific piece of business logic is really right without


interacting with it?


What we want instead is to pick off one slice of the project to in­


tegrate. Then when that’s done, the team has something tangible


that they’ve proven to work (or not work and reconsider). Anyone


can click through the interaction and see if the feature does what it


should and if what it does is what they want.



**1 0 4**


##### Case study: Clients in projects

We built a feature in Basecamp 3 that allowed service firms to invite


clients to their projects and share chosen documents, messages,

or to-do lists with them. The concept, defined in the pitch, had a


variety of moving parts:


- Client Access: Before this feature, Basecamp’s access


model was all or nothing. We needed a way to invite


some people to see just some parts of a project. This


had major back-end and caching implications.


- Client Management: We needed a way to add clients to projects


and the ability to manage clients separately from team members.


- Visibility Toggle: Each piece of content in a project


should have a toggle to expose it to clients or not.


The team had one designer and one programmer. After they got


oriented and familiar with how the existing code worked, the de­

signer chose the visibility toggle as the best place to integrate first.


This was the most central piece of UI in the project. It’s the one that


would appear in demo videos and the interaction customers would


use most.


The designer didn’t make a pixel-perfect mockup. Instead, he

experimented with different affordances and placements in the


app’s HTML templates. Should the toggle be two radio buttons, a


C H A P T E R 1 1 - G e t O n e P i e c e D o n e **1 0 5**


checkbox, or a custom button that changes state?


Meanwhile, the programmer wasn’t waiting around. He had enough


guidance from the pitch to start spiking the access model.


As soon as the designer felt confident in the basic direction of the


UI, he pinged the programmer and showed him the stubbed toggle.


Stepping away from the access problem for a bit, the programmer


wired the toggle enough so that it would appear on all the sup­


ported content types, change state when clicked, and save its state


in the database.


At this point, the toggle didn’t actually change the visibility of the

content. But it worked from the service firm’s point of view. The


designer could click it, feel it, and judge how well it worked with


live data on a staging server.


There was still more design work to do on the toggle. But the pro­

grammer didn’t need to be involved anymore. With the affordance


wired up, the designer could continue to experiment with copy,


placement, color, mobile view rendering, and more. Meanwhile,


the programmer could get back to the access model or whatever


else was most important to tackle next.


About three days after the start of the project, the designer demoed


the working toggle to a manager. Their conversation led to a few


more tweaks and then they were able to call the toggle “done.” One


important piece of the project was designed, implemented, demoed,


and settled. The team felt good about showing tangible progress.

And the team and management both felt confidence in the project


by seeing a working piece. By clicking through a core interaction


early, they were able to validate that what they hoped would make


sense in theory did indeed look right and make sense in practice.



**1 0 6**


This short example illustrates a few points about how the teams

integrate over short periods to finish one piece of the project at


a time.

##### Programmers don’t need to wait

Because the important moving parts were already defined in the


shaping process, programmers don’t need to sit idle waiting for


design when the project starts. There’s enough direction in the


pitch for them to start working on back-end problems from the start.


They won’t be able to take a piece of functionality to completion


without knowing where it leads on the front-end, but there should


be enough information in the pitch to inform foundational


modeling decisions.

##### Affordances before pixel-perfect screens


Programmers don’t need a pixel-perfect design to start implement­


ing. All they need are endpoints: input elements, buttons, places

where stored data should appear. These affordances are the core of


a user interface design.


Questions about font, color, spacing, and layout can be resolved

after the raw affordances are in place and hooked up in code. Copy­

writing, basic affordances, and some wiring are all we need to try a


live working version in the browser or on the device. Then we can


answer the fundamental questions early: Does it make sense? Is it


understandable? Does it do what we want?


That means the first interface a designer gives to a programmer can


look very basic, like the example below. It’s more like a breadboard


than a visual design or a polished mock-up.


C H A P T E R 1 1 - G e t O n e P i e c e D o n e **1 0 7**


This screenshot is from a registration app for multi-day courses.


The designer made it in HTML by hand. There’s barely any style

— just enough visual hierarchy to feel confident that the layout is


usable and amenable to future layers of styling.


While the design looks simple, a lot of decisions are reflected in it.


  - The decision to ask for arrival time but not depar­


ture time came from detailed discussions about


the business logic and pricing model.


  - The specific options in the arrival time pulldown correspond


to rules that had to be worked out about when to charge for

meals and overnight stays.The designer’s first sketches used a


calendar-style date picker for the arrival and departure days.


But that led to UX problems. Some courses were long (multiple

weeks) with different phases. There wasn’t room in a standard


calendar-style date picker to label the phases on the day boxes.


With a pulldown, she could use option groups to label groups of


dates when needed. That way users wouldn’t need to reference a


schedule elsewhere to be sure they were selecting the right dates.


**1 0 8**


Here’s another example. This is the first working piece of an app for


capturing data from customer interviews.


At this early stage the project name (Basecamp) and interview


subject (Jan) were hard-coded and most of the links didn’t


go anywhere.


Look at how raw this design is. The actions are plain text links in


the default blue and purple browser colors. The boxes containing


the data points are barely styled with plain black borders. As rough

as it is, this design tests some important trade-offs. The designer


chose to show as much data as possible above the fold so it would


be easy to review interviews. That didn’t leave enough room within


each section for UI to add, edit, or remove data points. That led the


designer to create separate screens for adding and editing data


per section.


C H A P T E R 1 1 - G e t O n e P i e c e D o n e **1 0 9**


This is the first design for adding and editing “pulls” — a type


of data in this interview technique. Again, look at how raw it is.


There’s just enough design here to quickly wire it up and test it. The


team can click through this to judge whether navigating to a sepa­


rate screen to record data is acceptable or not. If it works, they can


layer on additional styling later. If it doesn’t work, they didn’t waste


a lot of time implementing a pixel-perfect design.


Beautiful alignment, colors, and typography don’t matter on the

first pass. Visual styling is important in the end product, not in the


early stages. The biggest uncertainties are about whether it will


work, whether it will make sense, and how hard it will be to im­

plement. After the elements are wired up, they can be rearranged,


restyled, and repainted to improve the work that’s already done.


First make it work, then make it beautiful.

##### Program just enough for the next step


The same is true for back-end work. It doesn’t have to be all or

nothing. Sometimes a designer just needs some scaffolding—a

couple fields that save data or some code to navigate from one


stubbed screen to another. Other times she needs to populate a


variable in the template with a collection of real data so she can

iterate on different displays (rows, columns, media boxes, etc) to

find the best design.


The early back-end work can be strategically patchy. There might


be a controller to render templates but no model. Or a controller


and bits of a model with mock data but no support for creating or


updating the data. Screens that aren’t wired yet could at least be


connected with routes for navigating between them.


When it was time to test the first piece of the interview app, the



**1 1 0**


team knew there would be sensitive data from real interviews going


into it. They needed to protect it with some kind of authentication.


Rather than building full username and password support—or even


integrating a third-party solution—they just used plain HTTPAuth


to hard-code a password.


This allowed the team to try adding data from real interviews very


early in the cycle, without slowing down to hook up some authen­


tication code that wasn’t going to teach them anything about the


problems they were trying to solve.


The point is to create a back-and-forth between design and pro­


gramming on the same piece of the product. Instead of one big

hand-off, take turns layering in affordances, code, and visual


styling. Step by step, click through the real working feature-in-prog­


ress to judge how it’s coming and what to do next.

##### Start in the middle

In the examples above, the team didn’t build log in first. They didn’t


build a way to create an interview project and an interview subject


before solving the problem of adding interview data. They jumped


straight into the middle where the interesting problem was and


stubbed everything else to get there.


C H A P T E R 1 1 - G e t O n e P i e c e D o n e **1 1 1**


To expand on this, here are three criteria to think about when

choosing what to build first:


First, it should be **core** . The visibility toggle was core to the Clients


in Projects concept. Without it, the other work wouldn’t mean


anything. Contrast that with a more peripheral aspect of the project,


like the ability to rename a client. Both were “required,” but one


was more central and important to prove out early in the cycle. In


the interview app, recording interview data was more core—more in


the middle—than setting up a new research project.


Second, it should be **small** . If the first piece of work isn’t small

enough, there isn’t much benefit to carving it off from the rest. The

point is to finish something meaningful in a few days and build mo­


mentum—to have something real to click on that shows the team is


on the right track.


Third, it should be **novel** . If two parts of the project are both core


and small, prefer the thing that you’ve never done before. In the


Clients in Projects feature, the UI for adding clients was mostly the


same as the UI for adding regular users. Starting on that would


have moved the project forward, but it wouldn’t have taught the


team anything. It wouldn’t have eliminated uncertainty. Starting

with the visibility toggle boosted everyone’s confidence because it


proved that a new idea was going to work.



**1 1 2**


### **Map The Scopes**

In the previous chapter, we started the project by finishing one


integrated slice early on. That practice belongs to a more general


technique that the team can use throughout the project.

##### Organize by structure, not by person

When asked to organize tasks for a project, people often separate


work by person or role: they’ll create a list for Designers and a list


for Programmers. This leads to the problem we talked about in the


previous chapter—people will complete tasks, but the tasks won’t

add up to a finished part of the project early enough.


To take an example outside of software, consider someone orga­


nizing a fundraising event. They could create a list of tasks for


each of their three volunteers and track the work that way. But


then there’d be no way to see the big picture of how the event is


coming together—what’s done and what’s not done at the macro


C H A P T E R 1 2 - M a p T h e S c o p e s **1 1 3**


level. Instead, they should create lists based on the _structure_ of

the project—the things that can be worked on and finished inde­


pendently of each other. To do that, they would create lists for Food


Menu, Venue Setup, and Light/Sound. Then the organizer can


easily see which areas are done and which areas have


outstanding work.


In product development, the categories aren’t pre-cut for us. We


usually build things we’ve never built before. Each project is a wild


territory that we have to walk through before we can draw a map.

By digging into the work, we figure out where the interdependen­


cies are, how things are connected, and what we can slice apart.


As we saw in the previous chapter, the slices of work integrate front
end and back-end tasks. This allows us to finish one slice of the

actual project and definitively move on. That’s better than having

lots of pieces that—fingers crossed—are supposed to come together


by the end of the cycle.


We call these integrated slices of the project scopes. We break the


overall scope (singular) of the project into separate scopes (plural)

that can be finished independently of each other. In this chapter,


we’ll see how the team maps the project into scopes and tackles


them one by one.

##### The scope map


Imagine an overhead view of


the project. At the beginning,


there’s just an outline from


the shaping work that pre­


ceded the project. There aren’t


any tasks or scopes yet.



**1 1 4**


When the team members take over the project, they start discover­


ing tasks. Tasks are a natural starting point because they’re con­


crete and granular. It’s too early to organize them into higher level

categories. It would be artificial to try and group them arbitrarily.


It’s enough at the start just to capture a variety of things that need


to happen.


But we don’t want to stay with this picture for long. It’s too low

level. There’s nothing visible from high altitude.


As the team starts doing real work on the project they learn how the


tasks are related and what the structure of the project is really like.


Then they become able to factor the project into scopes. This is like


dividing the map of the project into separate territories.


C H A P T E R 1 2 - M a p T h e S c o p e s **1 1 5**


The scopes reflect the meaningful parts of the problem that can be


completed independently and in a short period of time—a few days


or less. They are bigger than tasks but much smaller than the


overall project.


The map is a mental image. In practice, we define and track the


scopes as to-do lists. Each scope corresponds to a list name. Then


any tasks for that scope go in that list.



**1 1 6**


##### The language of the project

Scopes are more than just slices. They become the language of the


project at the macro level. When we were building the _Clients in_


_Projects_ feature, the team used the language of the scopes like this:

“After _Bucket Access_ is done we can implement _Invite Clients_ . Then

we’ll _Update Recording Visibility_ when people on the firm flip the


_Visibility Toggle_ .”


When it’s time to report status, the team uses the language of


scopes to explain what’s done and what’s not done. It’s more

satisfying to have the conversation at a high level and point to fin­

ished pieces of software, instead of going down into the weeds and


defending the purposes and status of individual outstanding tasks.


(We’ll see more in the next chapter about how to report on scopes


using the Hill Chart.)

##### Case study: Message drafts


A designer and programmer were building a feature to create and

save drafts of messages in a new app. After kick-off, they identified


a bunch of tasks they would need to do at some point.


C H A P T E R 1 2 - M a p T h e S c o p e s **1 1 7**


As the end of the first week approached, they had completed some


of the tasks, but there wasn’t anything to show for their work. In


the spirit of “get one piece done” they focused on one key interac­

tion they could integrate: creating a new draft.


They called the new scope “Start New,” created a to-do list for it,

and moved to-dos into it. There was only one design task left for

them to consider this scope finished.


After finishing the one design task, the scope was complete.



**1 1 8**


The unscoped tasks that are left don’t represent all the work


that remains. More tasks are going to be discovered as they start


working on each of those. Still, there is enough variety in the work


to tease out more scopes. The team was motivated to break out the


scopes already at this point because they knew they wanted their

efforts to add up to another visible piece being finished before long.


Taking a look at the tasks that were left, they decided to pull out

tasks related to finding the drafts into a new scope called Locate


and the task for deleting into a scope called Trash. The work that

was left all seemed related to saving and editing the draft, so they


called that Save/Edit.


Take a look at the Locate scope. There’s only one task there right


now. But surely there will be more work to do than just designing


the index. When there are implementation tasks to do, that’s where


they’ll go.


The designer started some work on Locate while the programmer


focused on Save/Edit. As she dug into it, she noticed she could

carve off a couple pieces to make more visible progress. There were


really three scopes in it.


C H A P T E R 1 2 - M a p T h e S c o p e s **1 1 9**


First she factored out the work related to sending the drafted


message. She called that Send.


Finally, some of the remaining Save/Edit tasks were about storing


information and one other was actually unrelated—it was a special

case for handling drafts when replying to another message. She


broke these out into two new scopes: Store and Reply.



**1 2 0**


At this point the team suddenly felt like they could see the whole


of the project at a high level. All the major parts were visible at the


macro level as scopes. None of them were so big that important or


challenging tasks could hide inside of them unnoticed.


Meanwhile, the designer had made progress on Locate. After a little


wiring, they were able to mark that done. Tasks were getting done


on Send and Store as well.


Once Send and Store were finished, just a couple tasks remained for


Trash and Reply.


C H A P T E R 1 2 - M a p T h e S c o p e s **1 2 1**


And then the project was done.

##### Discovering scopes


Scope mapping isn’t planning. You need to walk the territory before


you can draw the map. Scopes properly drawn are not arbitrary

groupings or categories for the sake of tidiness. They reflect the real


ground truth of what can be done independently—the underlying


interdependencies and relationships in the problem.


Scopes arise from interdependencies. The way parts depend on


each other determines when you can say a given piece of the work


is “done.” You don’t know what the work and interdependencies


actually are in advance. We talked earlier about imagined versus


discovered tasks. The same principle applies to scopes. The scopes


need to be discovered by doing the real work and seeing how things


connect and don’t connect.


That’s why at the start of a project, we don’t expect to see accurate


scopes. We’re more likely to see them at the end of week one or start

of week two, after the team has had a chance to do some real work

and find the natural dividing lines in the anatomy of the problem.


It’s also normal to see some shuffling and instability in the scopes

at first. The lines get redrawn or scopes renamed as the team feels


out where the boundaries really are, like in the example above. The



**1 2 2**


team was focused on specific problems of saving and editing drafts,


so it was easiest to identify that scope early. It wasn’t until they got

into the weeds that they noticed there were tasks specifically about

sending the draft and made that a separate scope.

##### How to know if the scopes are right


Well-made scopes show the anatomy of the project. When you


feel a pain in your body, you don’t have to question whether it’s in


your arms or your legs or your head. You know the parts and their


names so you can explain where the pain is. In the same way, every


project has a natural anatomy that arises from the design you want,


the system you’re working within, and the interdependencies of the


problems you have to solve.


Three signs indicate when the scopes are right:


1. You feel like you can see the whole project and nothing im­


portant that worries you is hidden down in the details.


2. Conversations about the project become more flowing


because the scopes give you the right language.


3. When new tasks come up, you know where to put them. The


scopes act like buckets that you can easily lob new tasks into.


On the other hand, these three signs indicate the scopes should


be redrawn:


1. It’s hard to say how “done” a scope is. This often happens


when the tasks inside the scope are unrelated. If the problems

inside the scope are unrelated, finishing one doesn’t get you

closer to finishing the other. It’s good in this case to look for

something you can factor out, like in the Drafts example.


C H A P T E R 1 2 - M a p T h e S c o p e s **1 2 3**


2. The name isn’t unique to the project, like “front-end” or


“bugs.” We call these “grab bags” and “junk drawers.” This


suggests you aren’t integrating enough, so you’ll never get to


mark a scope “done” independent of the rest. For example,

with bugs, it’s better to file them under a specific scope so


you can know whether, for example, “Send” is done or if you

need to fix a couple bugs first before putting it out of mind.


3. It’s too big to finish soon. If a scope gets too big, with too


many tasks, it becomes like its own project with all the faults


of a long master to-do list. Better to break it up into pieces


that can be solved in less time, so there are victories along


the way and boundaries between the problems to solve.


Let’s close this chapter with a few tips for dealing with different


kinds of tasks and scopes that will come up.

##### Layer cakes

Most software projects require some UI design and a thin layer of


code below. Think of a database app where all you need to do is


enter information, save it, and display it back. Work like this looks


like a layer cake: You can judge the work by UI surface area because


the back-end work is thin and evenly distributed. In these cases,


you can integrate all design and programmer tasks together in the


same scope. This is a good default for most “information system”


type apps.



**1 2 4**


##### Icebergs

But sometimes there is significantly more back-end work than UI


work or vice versa. For example, a new feature that only requires


submitting a form could require very complex business logic to


return the right answer. This kind of work is like an iceberg.


For icebergs, it can help to factor out the UI as a separate scope of


work (assuming the UI isn’t interdependent with the back-end com­


plexity). If the back-end is complex enough, you can split it into


separate concerns and then turn those into scopes as well. The goal

in cases like this is to define some different things you can finish


and integrate in stages, rather than waiting until the 11th hour with

fingers crossed that it will all come together.


You also sometimes see upside-down icebergs, where there is a ton


of UI complexity with less back-end complexity. For example, the


data model for a calendar isn’t complicated, but the interaction


for rendering a multiple-day event and wrapping across grid cells


could take a lot of time and problem-solving.


C H A P T E R 1 2 - M a p T h e S c o p e s **1 2 5**


For both back-end and front-end icebergs, we always question them


before accepting them as a fact. Is the complexity really necessary

and irreducible? Do we need that fancy UI? Is there a different way


to build that back-end process so it has fewer interdependencies


with the rest of the system?

##### Chowder

There are almost always a couple things that don’t fit into a scope.

We allow ourselves a “Chowder” list for loose tasks that don’t fit


anywhere. But we always keep a skeptical eye on it. If it gets longer

than three to five items, something is fishy and there’s probably a


scope to be drawn somewhere.

##### Mark nice-to-haves with ~


New tasks constantly come up as you get deeper into a problem.

You’ll find code that could be cleaned up, edge cases to address,


and improvements to existing functionality. A good way to deal


with all those improvements is to record them as tasks on the scope


but mark them with a ~ in front. This allows everyone on the team


to constantly sort out the must-haves from the nice-to-haves.


In a world with no deadlines, we could improve everything forever.

But in a fixed time box, we need a machete in our hands to cut


down the constantly growing scope. The ~ at the start of an item, or


even a whole scope, is our best tool for that. We’ll come back to this


technique when we talk about making cuts to scope in Chapter 14,


Decide When to Stop.



**1 2 6**


### **Show Progress**

Good-hearted managers don’t like asking for status. It’s awkward,


feels like nagging, and gets even worse when they have to ask fol­

low-up questions to get sufficiently clear about what’s going on.


Managers would rather be able to see the status themselves when­


ever they need to. We saw in the last chapter how organizing to-dos


into scopes helps the team to stay on top of the work. But this


doesn’t help the manager directly. There are a couple problems

with to-dos that make them insufficient for judging status.

##### The tasks that aren’t there


Consider a list with a few completed items and no incomplete items

left. This could mean that all the work is done. But it could also

mean that the team knows there’s more work but hasn’t defined


tasks yet.


Sometimes a team will define a scope early in the project without


populating it with tasks. It marks that some work needs to be done


but that actual tasks haven’t been discovered yet.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 2 7**


Or think about doing some QA at the end of a scope. All the tasks


are done. There’s nothing else to do. Then the act of testing popu­


lates the scope with new tasks for the issues found.


This goes back to the notion of imagined versus discovered tasks. In


our naive notion of a list that’s planned up-front, somebody popu­

lates it with items that are gradually checked off. In real life, issues


are discovered by getting involved in the problem. That means


_to-do lists actually grow as the team makes progress_ .


If we tried to judge at _t_ _2_ how far along the project is, we’d be misled.


From an outsider’s perspective, there’s no way to know whether


the number of outstanding tasks will go down or up. To know


that, you’d need more context on the work inside the scope to


understand what it means that those particular tasks are done and


whether others might still be coming.



**1 2 8**


##### Estimates don’t show uncertainty

Some teams try to attach estimates to their tasks or scopes to report

status. The problem with estimates is they have a very different


meaning depending on the nature of the work being estimated.


Say you have two tasks, both estimated to take four hours. If one


task is something the team has done ten times in the past, you can

be confident in the estimate. Suppose the other task is something


the team has never done before, or it has unclear interdependen­


cies. It could take the four hours if all goes perfectly, but due to the


unknowns in it, it could stretch out to two to three days. It’s not


meaningful to write “4 hours, or maybe 3 days” as the estimate.


Recognizing this, we came up with a way to see the status of the


project without counting tasks and without numerical estimates.

We do that by shifting the focus from what’s done or not done to

what’s unknown and what’s solved. To enable this shift, we use the


metaphor of the hill.

##### Work is like a hill


Every piece of work has two phases. First there’s the uphill phase of

figuring out what our approach is and what we’re going to do. Then,


once we can see all the work involved, there’s the downhill phase


of execution.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 2 9**


Let’s use an everyday example to get the feeling of the hill.


Suppose you’re planning to host a dinner party. You’ve set the date,


but it’s still a couple weeks ahead and you haven’t thought about


what to cook yet. You have no idea what type of cuisine the meal


will be or what dish to make. That would place you at the start of

the hill on the bottom-left.


Next you think about who’s attending and note that a couple


people are vegetarian. That eliminates some options (like grilling


out) but still leaves a lot of options open. You consider both Italian


and Indian. You think Indian might be more fun to cook, with more


interesting vegetarian options. So you decide to look for


Indian recipes.


At this point, the question “What percent complete is the project?”


doesn’t even make sense. And if someone asked you to estimate


how long the shopping and prep will take, you couldn’t answer that


either because you haven’t chosen a dish yet. The answer would

be: “I’ve done some work to figure out what kind of cuisine, but I

haven’t narrowed it down to a specific dish yet.” We can represent

that by putting you halfway up the “figuring it out” side of the hill.



**1 3 0**


Next you do some searching online and look through your recipe

books. You want to find a recipe that will be interesting but doesn’t

require ingredients that will be too hard to find. You settle on a


recipe and prepare a shopping list.


Now you are in a very different position than before. The feeling


changes from “I’m still not sure what I’m doing” to “Now I know


what to do.” You’re at the top of the hill.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 3 1**


From this vantage point, you can see all of the steps that are left.


It’s even fair to estimate how long all the work will take (“Let’s


see…an hour to grocery shop, 30 minutes of prep, cook for 45


minutes…”).


The day before the dinner party, you go to the grocery store and buy

the ingredients. This moves you downhill. You’re closer to finishing


the task.


Next comes the work of prepping and cooking the meal.



**1 3 2**


After the meal is over, there’s just a little work left: the clean-up.


Note how the hill shows how the work _feels_ at different stages. The


uphill phase is full of uncertainty, unknowns, and problem solving.

The downhill phase is marked by certainty, confidence, seeing


everything, and knowing what to do.

##### Scopes on the hill


We can combine the hill with the concept of scopes from the last


chapter. The scopes give us the language for the project (“Locate,”


“Reply”) and the hill describes the status of each scope


(“uphill,” “downhill”).


To see the status of the scopes, we can plot each one as a different


color on the hill.


This is a snapshot from a project to implement recurring events in


Basecamp. Here “Future-applying edits” is a scope that is still being

worked out, with significant unknowns to solve. The other two

scopes have no meaningful unknowns left, and “Global recurring

events” is closer to finished.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 3 3**


##### Status without asking

We built a feature exclusive to Basecamp for creating hill charts and


updating them with a few clicks. The team members, who have the


full context of where the work stands, intuitively drag the scopes


into position, and save a new update that’s logged on the project


(see How to Implement Shape Up in Basecamp).



**1 3 4**


For managers, the ability to compare past states is the killer feature.


It shows not only where the work stands but how the work


is _moving_ .


With this second-order view, managers can judge what’s in motion


and what’s stuck. They can see which problems the team chose to


solve and how much time they spent at each stage from unknown


to known to done.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 3 5**


This report becomes the manager’s first destination when they feel


anxious about a project. Since it’s self-serve, there’s no need to


interrupt the team with the awkward status question. And in cases


where something doesn’t look right, the manager can jump directly


into a conversation about the relevant piece of work. “Looks like


‘Autosave’ has been uphill for a while. What’s the unknown that’s

holding it back?” The manager can workshop this specific piece

of the project without having to first untangle it from all the other


things that are moving along as expected.

##### Nobody says “I don’t know”


Nobody wants to raise their hand to management and say “I don’t


know how to solve this problem.” This causes teams to hide uncer­


tainty and accumulate risk. The moments when somebody is stuck


or going in circles are where the biggest risks and opportunities lie.


If we catch those moments early, we can address them with help


from someone senior or by reworking the concept. If we don’t catch


them, the unsolved problems could linger so far into the cycle that


they endanger the project.


The hill chart allows everybody to see that somebody might be


stuck without them actually saying it. A dot that doesn’t move is

effectively a raised hand: “Something might be wrong here.”


**1 3 6**


Once it’s been spotted, the language of uphill/downhill facilitates


the conversation. It’s less about the person (Looks like you’re


stuck!) and more about the work. The question is: What can we


solve to get that over the hill?

##### Prompts to refactor the scopes


Sometimes probing into a stuck scope reveals that it isn’t stuck at


all. The problem is in how the lines of the scope were drawn.


Here’s a case where the “Notify” scope was stuck on the hill for


too long.


When we checked in with the team, it turned out the work was

moving along just fine. The problem was that “Notify” wasn’t a

single thing. It had three different parts: designing an email, de­

livering the email in the back-end, and displaying the notification

in an in-app menu. The team mostly finished the code for deliver­

ing the email. The design of the email was nearly figured out. But


they hadn’t started on the in-app display. It wasn’t possible to say


whether “Notify” as a whole was over the hill or not because parts


of it were and parts of it weren’t.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 3 7**


The solution in a case like this is to break the scope apart into


smaller scopes that can move independently.


Now the team can move each dot to accurately show where the


work stands.



**1 3 8**


The benefit comes at the second order. With the scopes separated


out, they can move independently over time. Now the team can


show more progress more frequently than before.

##### Build your way uphill

Some teams struggle with backsliding when they first try the hill


chart. They consider a scope solved, move it the top of the hill,


and later have to slide it back when they uncover an unexpected


unknown.


When this happens, it’s often because somebody did the uphill


work with their head instead of their hands. Coming up with an

approach in your head is just the first step uphill. We often have a


theory of how we’ll solve something—“I’ll just use that API”—and


then the reality turns out to be more complicated. It’s good to think

of the first third uphill as “I’ve thought about this,” the second

third as “I’ve validated my approach,” and the final third to the top


as “I’m far enough with what I’ve built that I don’t believe there are


other unknowns.”

##### Solve in the right sequence


In addition to seeing where the work stands, we can use the hill


chart to sequence the work—which problems to solve in


which order.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 3 9**


Some scopes are riskier than others. Imagine two scopes: One in­


volves geocoding data—something the team has never done before.

The other is designing and implementing an email notification.


Both have unknowns. Both start at the bottom of the hill. This is


where the team asks themselves: If we were out of time at the end


of the cycle, which of these could we easily whip together—despite


the unknowns—and which might prove to be harder than we think?


That motivates the team to push the scariest work uphill first. Once


they get uphill, they’ll leave it there and look for anything critically

important before finishing the downhill work to completion. It’s


better to get a few critical scopes over the top early in the project


and leave the screw-tightening for later.


Work expands to fill the time available. If the team starts with the

email template first, they could easily spend weeks iterating on


copy or creating the ultimate best-ever email design. But they don’t


_need_ to do that. There’s some version of an email template that

could be worked out in a day during the final week and it would be

sufficient. The geocoder, on the other hand, might present novel


problems that the team could struggle with for weeks. They don’t


want that surprise to come at the end of the cycle.


Journalists have a concept called the “inverted pyramid.” The idea


is their articles start with the most essential information at the top,


then they add details and background information in decreasing


order of importance. This allows print newspaper designers to get


the crucial part of the story on the front page and cut the end as


needed without losing anything essential.


Effective teams sequence their problem solving in the same way.

They choose the most important problems first with the most



**1 4 0**


unknowns, get them to the top of the hill, and leave the things that


are the most routine or least worrisome for last.


As the end of the cycle approaches, teams should have finished the

important things and left a variety of “nice to haves” and “maybes”


lingering around. That brings us to the next chapter, on deciding


when to stop.


C H A P T E R 1 3 - S h o w P r o g r e s s **1 4 1**


### **Decide When to Stop**

When the end of the cycle approaches, the techniques we covered

so far will put the team in a good position to finish and ship. The


shaped work gave them guard rails to prevent them from wander­

ing. They integrated one scope at a time so there isn’t half-finished


work lying around. And all the most important problems have been

solved because they prioritized those unknowns first when they


sequenced the work.


Still, there’s always more work than time. Shipping on time means


shipping something imperfect. There’s always some queasiness in


the stomach as you look at your work and ask yourself: Is it good


enough? Is this ready to release?



**1 4 2**


##### Compare to baseline

Designers and programmers always want to do their best work. It


doesn’t matter if the button is on the center of the landing page or


two pages down a settings screen, the designer will give it their best


attention. And the best programmers want the code base to feel like


a cohesive whole, completely logically consistent with every edge


case covered.


Pride in the work is important for quality and morale, but we need


to direct it at the right target. If we aim for an ideal perfect design,


we’ll never get there. At the same time, we don’t want to lower our


standards. How do we make the call to say what we have is good


enough and move on?


It helps to shift the point of comparison. Instead of comparing up


against the ideal, compare down to baseline—the current reality


for customers. How do customers solve this problem today, without


this feature? What’s the frustrating workaround that this feature


eliminates? How much longer should customers put up with some­


thing that doesn’t work or wait for a solution because we aren’t sure


if design A might be better than design B?


Seeing that our work so far is better than the current alternatives


makes us feel better about the progress we’ve made. This motivates


us to make calls on the things that are slowing us down. It’s less

about us and more about value for the customer. It’s the difference


between “never good enough” and “better than what they have

now.” We can say “Okay, this isn’t perfect, but it definitely works


and customers will feel like this is a big improvement for them.”


C H A P T E R 1 4 - D e c i d e W h e n t o S t o p **1 4 3**


_Make scope cuts by comparing down to baseline_


_instead of up to some perfect ideal_

##### Limits motivate trade-offs


Recall that the six-week bet has a circuit breaker—if the work


doesn’t get done, the project doesn’t happen.


This forces the team to make trade-offs. When somebody says

“wouldn’t it be better if…” or finds another edge case, they should

first ask themselves: Is there time for this? Without a deadline,


they could easily delay the project for changes that don’t actually


deserve the extra time.


We expect our teams to actively make trade-offs and question the

scope instead of cramming and pushing to finish tasks. We create


our own work for ourselves. We should question any new work that


comes up before we accept it as necessary.

##### Scope grows like grass


Scope grows naturally. Scope creep isn’t the fault of bad clients,


bad managers, or bad programmers. Projects are opaque at the


macro scale. You can’t see all the little micro-details of a project


until you get down into the work. Then you discover not only


**1 4 4**


complexities you didn’t anticipate, but all kinds of things that

could be fixed or made better than they are.


Every project is full of scope we don’t need. Every part of a product


doesn’t need to be equally prominent, equally fast, and equally


polished. Every use case isn’t equally common, equally critical, or


equally aligned with the market we’re trying to sell to.


This is how it is. Rather than trying to stop scope from growing,


give teams the tools, authority, and responsibility to constantly cut


it down.

##### Cutting scope isn’t lowering quality


Picking and choosing which things to execute and how far to


execute on them doesn’t leave holes in the product. Making choices


makes the product better. It makes the product better _at some_

_things_ instead of others. Being picky about scope _differentiates_ the

product. Differentiating what is core from what is peripheral moves

us in competitive space, making us more alike or more different

than other products that made different choices.


Variable scope is not about sacrificing quality. We are extremely


picky about the quality of our code, our visual design, the copy in


our interfaces, and the performance of our interactions. The trick is


asking ourselves which things actually matter, which things move

the needle, and which things make a difference for the core use


cases we’re trying to solve.

##### Scope hammering

People often talk about “cutting” scope. We use an even stronger

word—hammering—to reflect the power and force it takes to repeat­

edly bang the scope so it fits in the time box.


C H A P T E R 1 4 - D e c i d e W h e n t o S t o p **1 4 5**


As we come up with things to fix, add, improve, or redesign during


a project, we ask ourselves:


- Is this a “must-have” for the new feature?


- Could we ship without this?


- What happens if we don’t do this?


- Is this a new problem or a pre-existing one


that customers already live with?


- How likely is this case or condition to occur?


- When this case occurs, which customers see it? Is it


core—used by everyone—or more of an edge case?


- What’s the actual impact of this case or con­


dition in the event it does happen?


- When something doesn’t work well for a particular use case,


how aligned is that use case with our intended audience?


The fixed deadline motivates us to ask these questions. Variable


scope enables us to act on them. By chiseling and hammering the


scope down, we stay focused on just the things we need to do to

ship something effective that we can be proud of at the end of the


time box.


Throughout the cycle, you’ll hear our teams talking about must

haves and nice-to-haves as they discover work. The must-haves are


captured as tasks on the scope. The scope isn’t considered “done”

until those tasks are finished. Nice-to-haves can linger on a scope

after it’s considered done. They’re marked with a tilde (~) in front.


Those tasks are things to do if the team has extra time at the end



**1 4 6**


and things to cut if they don’t. Usually they never get built. The act


of marking them as a nice-to-have is the scope hammering.


_A finished scope with one nice-to-have (marked with a “~”)_


_that was never completed_

##### QA is for the edges


At Basecamp’s current size (millions of users and about a dozen


people on the product team), we have one QA person. They come in


toward the end of the cycle and hunt for edge cases outside the


core functionality.


QA can limit their attention to edge cases because the designers


and programmers take responsibility for the basic quality of their


work. Programmers write their own tests, and the team works to­


gether to ensure the project does what it should according to what


was shaped. This follows from giving the team responsibility for


the whole project instead of assigning them individual tasks (see


Chapter 9, Hand Over Responsibility).


For years we didn’t have a QA role. Then after our user base grew


to a certain size, we saw that small edge cases began to impact


hundreds or thousands of users in absolute numbers. Adding the


C H A P T E R 1 4 - D e c i d e W h e n t o S t o p **1 4 7**


extra QA step helped us improve the experience for those users and


reduce the disproportional burden they would create for support.


Therefore we think of QA as a level-up, not a gate or a check-point

that all work must go through. We’re much better off with QA than


without it. But we don’t depend on QA to ship quality features that


work as they should.


QA generates discovered tasks that are all nice-to-haves by default.


The designer-programmer team triages them and, depending on


severity and available time, elevates some of them to must-haves.


The most rigorous way to do this is to collect incoming QA issues on


a separate to-do list. Then, if the team decides an issue is a must
have, they drag it to the list for the relevant scope it affects. This


helps the team see that the scope isn’t done until the issue


is addressed.


We treat code review the same way. The team can ship without


waiting for a code review. There’s no formal check-point. But code


review makes things better, so if there’s time and it makes sense,


someone senior may look at the code and give feedback. It’s more


about taking advantage of a teaching opportunity than creating a


step in our process that must happen every time.

##### When to extend a project


In very rare cases, we’ll extend a project that runs past its deadline


by a couple weeks. How do we decide when to extend a project and


when to let the circuit breaker do its thing?


First, the outstanding tasks must be true must-haves that withstood


every attempt to scope hammer them.


Second, the outstanding work must be all downhill. No unsolved



**1 4 8**


problems; no open questions. Any uphill work at the end of the


cycle points to an oversight in the shaping or a hole in the concept.


Unknowns are too risky to bet on. If the work is uphill, it’s better


to do something else in the next cycle and put the troubled project

back in the shaping phase. If you find a viable way to patch the


hole, then you can consider betting more time on it again in the


future.


Even if the conditions are met to consider extending the project, we


still prefer to be disciplined and enforce the appetite for most proj­


ects. The two-week cool-down usually provides enough slack for a


team with a few too many must-haves to ship before the next cycle


starts. But this shouldn’t become a habit. Running into cool-down


either points back to a problem in the shaping process or a perfor­


mance problem with the team.


C H A P T E R 1 4 - D e c i d e W h e n t o S t o p **1 4 9**


### **Move On**

##### Let the storm pass

Shipping can actually generate new work if you’re not careful.


Feature releases beget feature requests. Customers say “Okay, that’s


great, but what about that other thing we’ve been asking for?”


Bugs pop up. Suggestions for improvements come in. Everyone is


focused on the new thing and reacting to it.


The feedback can be especially intense if the feature you shipped

changes existing workflows. Even purely visual changes sometimes


spur intense pushback. A small minority of customers might over­


react and say things like “You ruined it! Change it back!”


It’s important to stay cool and avoid knee-jerk reactions. Give it a

few days and allow it to die down. Be firm and remember why you

made the change in the first place and who the change is helping.

##### Stay debt-free


It can be tempting to commit to making changes in response to


feedback, but then you no longer have a clean slate for the next


cycle. Remember: these are just raw ideas coming in. The way to


handle them is with a gentle “no.” Saying “no” doesn’t prevent you


from continuing to contemplate them and maybe shape them up


into future projects. Saying “yes,” on the other hand, takes away


your freedom in the future. It’s like taking on debt.


Remember, the thing you just shipped was a six-week bet. If this


part of the product needs more time, then it requires a new bet. Let


the requests or bugs that just came up compete with everything else


at the next betting table to be sure they’re strategically important.



**1 5 0**


##### Feedback needs to be shaped

Here we come full circle. The raw ideas that just came in from cus­


tomer feedback aren’t actionable yet. They need to be shaped. They


are the raw inputs that we talked about in step one of the shaping


process: Set Boundaries.


If a request is truly important, you can make it your top priority on


the shaping track of the next cycle. Bet on something else for the


teams to build and use that time to properly shape the new idea.


Then, when the six weeks are over, you can make the case at the


betting table and schedule the shaped version of the project for the


greatest chance of success.

### **Conclusion**

##### Key concepts

The Shape Up method presented in this book is tightly interwoven.


It may take some thought and experimentation to pull out the right


pieces and adapt them to your team.


Whether your team can adopt the method at once or not, I hope


that the language and concepts in this book gave you some things


to take home immediately:


- Shaped versus unshaped work


- Setting appetites instead of estimates


- Designing at the right level of abstraction


- Concepting with breadboards and fat marker sketches


- Making bets with a capped downside (the circuit breaker)


and honoring them with uninterrupted time


- Choosing the right cycle length (six weeks)


- A cool-down period between cycles


- Breaking projects apart into scopes


- Downhill versus uphill work and com­


municating about unknowns


- Scope hammering to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves

### **How to Implement** **Shape Up in Basecamp**

We built Basecamp to implement the Shape Up method. Instead of


scattering our work across multiple tools, Basecamp centralizes all


project communication, task management, and documentation in


one place. Here’s how we use it.

##### A Basecamp Team for shaping


1. Create a Basecamp Team for shaping. We


call ours “Product Strategy.”


2. Add the people doing the shaping, any trusted people


who give feedback on pitches, and the people who


bet at the betting table. Keep this group small and an­


nounce the bets more widely elsewhere (we use Base­

camp’s HQ for that), when it’s time to kick off a cycle.


3. Post pitches as Messages on the Message Board.


We created a Message Category called “Pitch”


with the light bulb emoji for the icon.


4. Use the Campfire chat room to bounce ideas and co­


ordinate the betting table between cycles. We conduct


the actual betting table meeting over video chat.

_—a Team in Basecamp that includes the whole company_

##### Basecamp Projects for the cycle projects


1. Create a Basecamp Project for each project in the six

week cycle. We usually prepend a name or number


for the cycle like this: “Cycle 4: Autopay.”


2. Add the designer and program­


mers who are working on this


project to the Basecamp Project.


3. Post a kick-off message to the


Message Board with the pitch



or a restatement of the shaped


work for the team’s reference.

_The team uses the chat room in the Basecamp project_


_to communicate as they get started_

##### To-Do Lists for scopes

1. After the team gets oriented they start spiking, dis­


cover tasks, and map them into scopes.


2. In the Basecamp Project, the team creates a To-Do List for each


scope, like “Start Autopay” or “ACH Option.” Sometimes we use

the description field on the To-Do List to summarize the scope.


3. Add design _and_ programming tasks to each scope as To-Do


Items. For example, “Start Autopay” has one task for design


the UI and another task for wiring it to the existing recur­


ring billing API. They can use the discussion thread on each


To-Do Item to post updates or ask each other questions.


4. Repeat as the team discovers new scopes and tasks.

_Note: these are just the tasks discovered so far._

##### Track scopes on the Hill Chart


1. Navigate to the To-Do List page for each scope and click


the options menu (•••) in the upper right. Click “Track


this on the Hill Chart.” That will display a Hill Chart at


the top of the overall To-Dos section of the Project, with


a dot corresponding to that scope (To-Do List).


2. Repeat for each scope (To-Do List).


3. Click “Update” on the Hill Chart and drag the dots to show


progress from “unknown” to “known” to “done.” Use the


annotation feature to add commentary when necessary.

4. To see the history of updates to the Hill Chart, click the time­


stamp above the Hill Chart where it says “last update.”

Other tools make it hard to see everything about the project in one


place. Basecamp combines chat, messages, to-dos, and documents


in one interface that’s powerful enough for technical people and


friendly enough for everyone else to use. Programmers, design­


ers, QA and managers feel equally at home and can work together


seamlessly on projects. Visit basecamp.com to try Basecamp free


for 30 days.

### **Adjust to Your Size**

##### Basic truths vs. specific practices

To apply Shape Up to your company, it helps to separate out the

basic truths from the specific practices.


Work has to come from somewhere, and it takes work to figure


out what the right work is. This is shaping. Shaping the work sets


clearer boundaries and expectations for whoever does the work—


whether that’s a separate team or just your future self. If we don’t

make trade-offs up front by shaping, the universe will force us to

make trade-offs later in a mad rush when we’re confronted by dead­


lines, technical limitations, or resource constraints.


The same is true with betting. Six weeks might not be the exact


time frame for your team. But the consequences of making unclear


or open-ended commitments are the same for everyone. Regardless

of the specific time frame we bet on, we should be deliberate about


what we bet on and cap our downside with a circuit breaker.


In the building phase, there will be unknowns to deal with whether


you track them on a hill chart or not. We need to distinguish the


knowns from the unknowns so we can sequence the work in the


right order and reserve capacity for the unknowns.


These truths apply regardless of the size of your organization. The

specific practices, on the other hand, are scale-dependent. Let’s


have a look at what it means to implement Shape Up at a very small


start-up and an organization that’s grown big enough for special­


ized roles and more structure.


C H A P T E R 1 8 - A d j u s t t o Y o u r S i z e **1 6 5**


##### Small enough to wing it

When your team is just two or three people, everybody does a bit of


everything. Since a few people are wearing many hats and per­

forming many roles, it’s difficult to commit long chunks of uninter­

rupted time to specific projects. The person doing the programming


might also be answering customer requests and dealing with an


infrastructure issue all at the same time.


It’s also easier to communicate and change course when you’re


small. You can drop something in the group chat or talk about it in


person and everyone’s immediately on the same page.


For these reasons, a tiny team can throw out most of the structure.


You don’t need to work six weeks at a time. You don’t need a cool

down period, formal pitches or a betting table. Instead of parallel


tracks with dedicated shapers and builders, the same people can


alternate back and forth. Be deliberate about which hat you’re


wearing and what phase you’re in. Set an appetite, shape what to


do next, build it, then shape the next thing. Your bets might be

different sizes each time: maybe two weeks here, three weeks there.


You’re still shaping, betting, and building, but you’re doing it more

fluidly without the rigid structure of cycles and cool-downs.


_The phases of the work still hold true even if you don’t work in cycles_


_or have dedicated people to do the shaping and building_



**1 6 6**


##### Big enough to specialize

After you hire more people, all of this fluidity flips from an asset to


a liability. Winging it with ad-hoc meetings and chat room discus­


sions doesn’t work anymore. Coordination starts to eat up more of


your time and things begin to slip through the cracks.


This is when it makes sense to take on the structure of six-week


cycles, cool-downs, and a formal betting table. With more people


available to build, someone needs to carve out more time to do

the work of figuring out _what_ to build. This could mean a founder


spends more time shaping than building, or it could mean elevat­


ing an employee from doing in-cycle design work to more out-of-cy­


cle shaping work.


At Basecamp’s current size (about 50 people in the whole company,


roughly a dozen in the product team) we’ve been able to specialize


roles so teams of designers and programmers can work without any


interruption in the cycles. A dedicated team called SIP (Security, In­


frastructure, and Performance) handles technical work that’s lower


in the stack and more structural. Our Ops team keeps the lights on.


We have technical people on the Support team who can investigate


problems raised by customers. All this means that we don’t need to


interrupt the designers and programmers on our Core Product team


who work on shaped projects within the cycles.


C H A P T E R 1 8 - A d j u s t t o Y o u r S i z e **1 6 7**


With dedicated shapers and builders, the picture is more structured.


Shapers work on an “out of cycle” track. Cool-down between cycles

gives everyone room to fix bugs and address loose ends that pop up.


The betting table is held during cool-down and then bets are placed


for the next cycle.


_With more people, shaping and building happen on separate tracks_

_and bets are made to fill six-week cycles_



**1 6 8**


### **How to Begin to Shape Up**

##### Option A: One six-week experiment

You don’t need to change everything all at once. If the whole

product team isn’t ready to make a big change, just start off with a


single six-week experiment. These are the steps to take:


1. Shape one significant project that can be com­

fortably finished within six weeks. Be conserva­

tive and allow extra time on your first run.


2. Carve out one designer and two programmers’ time


for the entire six weeks. Guarantee that nobody will in­


terrupt them for the length of the experiment.


3. Instead of a proper betting table, simply plan for the team


to do the work you shaped for this one experiment.


4. Kick off by presenting your shaped work to the team, with all


the ingredients of a pitch. Set the expectation that they will


discover and track their own tasks. (Hand Over Responsibility)


5. Dedicate a physical space or a chat room to the cross-func­


tional team so they can work closely together.


6. Encourage them to Get One Piece Done by wiring


UI and code together early in the project.


You don’t need to worry about Mapping the Scopes or Showing


Progress right away. You should see a big leap in progress just by


dedicating uninterrupted time, shaping the work in advance, and


letting the team work out the details.


C H A P T E R 1 9 - H o w t o B e g i n t o S h a p e U p **1 6 9**


Once the team gets used to Getting One Piece Done, the stage will


be set for properly mapping scopes down the road. It’s the same

idea, just repeated. Later still, when they are good at defining


scopes, you can use the hill chart to Show Progress on those scopes.


This approach lets you demonstrate success with one team and a


single six-week commitment. With credibility gained from a good


outcome, it’ll be easier to lobby for a bigger change and convert the


wider team to working this way.

##### Option B: Start with shaping


Sometimes it’s not possible to get a team together to work for six


weeks because somebody else, a CTO perhaps, controls the pro­


grammers’ time. In that case, you can start by shaping a compelling


project with clearer boundaries than past projects. Present the


project and put it through your company’s existing scheduling


process (even if it’s a paper shredder). Better-shaped work can


shine a light on the engineering team and help them open up to


things like longer cycles or a more deliberate betting process.

##### Option C: Start with cycles


Another approach is to start by working in six week cycles. For


teams that formerly used two-week sprints, this removes the over­


head of constant planning meetings and gives programmers more


time to build momentum and hit their stride. Once the team has


more room to breathe, it’ll be natural to think more about how to


shape the work to take advantage of this new capacity.

##### Fix shipping first

Build your shipping muscles before you worry too much about im­


proving your research or discovery process. You can have the best


customer insight in the world, but if you can’t turn it into a project

and ship, it won’t matter. First get the team into a rhythm of finish­


ing things. Once you have the capability to ship, then you can start


improving the inputs to your shaping process.

##### Focus on the end result


Sometimes it can be scary to give the teams more free rein to set


their own tasks and schedule. You might wonder: What if they


don’t use up all the time we dedicate for the cycle? What if one of


the programmers or designers sits idle at some point in the cycle?


To overcome these worries, shift the mindset from the micro to the

macro. Ask yourself: How will we feel if we ship this project after


six weeks? Will we feel good about what we accomplished? When


projects ship on time and everyone feels they made progress, that’s


the success. It doesn’t matter what exactly happened down at the


scale of hours or days along the way. It’s the outcome that matters.
