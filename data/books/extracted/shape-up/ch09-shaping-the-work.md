##### Shaping the work


Second, we **shape the work** before giving it to a team. A small

senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define the


key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet

on. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete


enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that


they have room to work out the interesting details themselves.


When shaping, we focus less on estimates and more on our



**1 4**


**appetite** . Instead of asking how much time it will _take_ to do some


work, we ask: How much time do we want to _spend_ ? How much is


this idea worth? This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the

problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the


constraints of our appetite.
