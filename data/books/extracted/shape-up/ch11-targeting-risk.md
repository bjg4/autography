##### Targeting risk

At every step of the process we target a specific risk: the risk of not


shipping on time. This book isn’t about the risk of building the


wrong thing. Other books can help you with that (we recommend


Competing Against Luck). Improving your discovery process should

come after regaining your ability to ship. You can have the best


strategy in the world, but if you can’t act on it, what good does


it do?


This book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting


bogged down with last quarter’s work, wasting time on unexpected


C H A P T E R 1 - I n t r o d u c t i o n **1 5**


problems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow.


We reduce risk in the shaping process by solving open questions


_before_ we commit the project to a time box. We don’t give a project


to a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.


We reduce risk in the planning process by capping our bets to six


weeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension.


This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the

original appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first.


And lastly we reduce risk in the building process by integrating


design and programming early. Instead of building lots of discon­

nected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we


build one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and


then repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown


to the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what


doesn’t by integrating as soon as possible.
