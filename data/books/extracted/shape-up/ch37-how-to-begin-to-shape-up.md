### **How to Begin to Shape Up**

##### Option A: One six-week experiment

You don’t need to change everything all at once. If the whole

product team isn’t ready to make a big change, just start off with a


single six-week experiment. These are the steps to take:


1. Shape one significant project that can be com­

fortably finished within six weeks. Be conserva­

tive and allow extra time on your first run.


2. Carve out one designer and two programmers’ time


for the entire six weeks. Guarantee that nobody will in­


terrupt them for the length of the experiment.


3. Instead of a proper betting table, simply plan for the team


to do the work you shaped for this one experiment.


4. Kick off by presenting your shaped work to the team, with all


the ingredients of a pitch. Set the expectation that they will


discover and track their own tasks. (Hand Over Responsibility)


5. Dedicate a physical space or a chat room to the cross-func­


tional team so they can work closely together.


6. Encourage them to Get One Piece Done by wiring


UI and code together early in the project.


You don’t need to worry about Mapping the Scopes or Showing


Progress right away. You should see a big leap in progress just by


dedicating uninterrupted time, shaping the work in advance, and


letting the team work out the details.

Once the team gets used to Getting One Piece Done, the stage will


be set for properly mapping scopes down the road. It’s the same

idea, just repeated. Later still, when they are good at defining


scopes, you can use the hill chart to Show Progress on those scopes.


This approach lets you demonstrate success with one team and a


single six-week commitment. With credibility gained from a good


outcome, it’ll be easier to lobby for a bigger change and convert the


wider team to working this way.
