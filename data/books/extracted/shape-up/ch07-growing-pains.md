##### Growing pains

As software teams start to grow, some common struggles appear:


- Team members feel like projects go on


and on, with no end in sight.


- Product managers can’t find time to think


strategically about the product.


- Founders ask themselves: “Why can’t we get features


out the door like we used to in the early days?”


We saw these challenges first-hand at Basecamp as we grew from

four people to over fifty.


Basecamp started off in 2003 as a tool we built for ourselves. At the


time we were a consultancy designing websites for clients. Infor­


mation would get lost in the game of telephone between the client,


the designer, and the person managing the project. We wanted


Basecamp to be a centralized place where all parties could see


the work, discuss it, and know what to do next. It turned out lots


of companies had this “information slipping through the cracks”


problem. Today millions of people across all kinds of industries rely

on Basecamp as their shared source of truth.


Three of us built the first version. Jason Fried, Basecamp’s founder,


led the design. His co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson, pro­


grammed it (and created the well-known web framework Ruby on


Rails as a by-product). At the time I was a web designer with a focus


on usability and user interfaces. I executed Jason’s design direc­

tion for key features of the app and collaborated with him to fill in


details of the concept.


From the first prototypes in July 2003 to launch in February 2004,


David only worked ten hours a week. We knew we wouldn’t get any­


where with those ten hours of programming unless we used them


very deliberately. Our intense focus on “hammering” the scope to

fit within a given time budget was born under these constraints.


As the business grew, I started widening my skills. Working with


David and Ruby on Rails made the world of programming accessi­


ble to me. I learned the techniques programmers use to tame com­


plexity: things like factoring, levels of abstraction, and separation


of concerns. With one foot in the design world and one foot in the

programming world, I wondered if we could apply these software


development principles to the way we designed and managed


the product.


The first test of this idea came in 2009. By then we had hired a few

more programmers and offered four separate software-as-a-service


products. We wanted to bundle the products together into a seam­

less suite with single-sign-on and unified billing. It was a massive

technical undertaking with treacherous user-facing flows. Besides


getting the underlying architecture right, we had to interrupt cus­


tomers on their way in to the product and make them change their

username and password for reasons that weren’t easy to explain.


I wore the designer and product manager hats on the project and


prototyped the breadboarding and scope mapping techniques


described in this book to manage the complexity.


We had such good results that we decided to apply the same tech­


niques again in 2012, when we redesigned Basecamp from scratch


for version 2.0. Again there was a lot of surface area to manage and


again the process was surprisingly smooth.


By 2015, we had a core team that had lived through these expe­


riences and hit an impressive stride. But we found it hard to ar­


ticulate what we were doing to new hires. Our product team had


quadrupled and everyone worked remotely. That made it hard to


pass on our intuitions. We needed language to describe what we


were doing and more structure to keep doing it at our new scale.


To manage this new capacity, we switched from ad-hoc project

lengths to repeating cycles. (It took some experimentation to find


the right cycle length: six weeks. More on that later.) We formalized

our pitching and betting processes. My role shifted again, from


design and product management to product strategy. I needed new


language, like the word “shaping”, to describe the up-front design


work we did to set boundaries and reduce risks on projects before


we committed them to teams.


Just as we were getting better at articulating the way we work to


ourselves, more and more of our friends and peers started coming


to us to ask how we do it. Finally Jason pulled me aside one day


and said, I think you should write a book about this.


This is the result. You can think of this as two books in one. First,


it’s a book of basic truths. I want it to give you better language to


C H A P T E R 1 - I n t r o d u c t i o n **1 3**


describe and deal with the risks, uncertainties, and challenges that


come up whenever you do product development. Second, the book

outlines the specific processes we’re using to make meaningful


progress on our products at our current scale.


Here’s a short overview of the main ideas in the book.
