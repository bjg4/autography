##### How this book is organized


Part One is all about **Shaping** — the pre-work we do on projects


before we consider them ready to schedule. Each chapter explains

a specific step of the process, from setting the appetite on a raw


idea, to sketching out a solution, to writing a pitch that presents

the potential project. Along the way you’ll learn specific techniques


— like breadboarding and fat-marker sketching — to keep the design


at the right level of abstraction.


Part Two is about **Betting** — how we choose among the pitched


projects and decide what to do six weeks at a time.


Part Three is about **Building** — the expectations we place on the


teams and the special practices they use to discover what to do.


**1 6**


We’ll look at how the teams figure out what to do, how they in­


tegrate design and programming, how they track what’s known

versus unknown, and finally how they make the hard calls to finish


the project on time.


Lastly the Appendix gives you some help for when it’s time to make


changes at your company. There’s some advice on how to try your

first six-week experiment, tips on adjusting the methods to your

company’s size, and specific guidance for how to implement Shape


Up using Basecamp.
