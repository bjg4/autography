##### Six-week cycles

Committing time and people is difficult if we can’t easily determine


who’s available and for how long. When people are available at

different times due to overlapping projects, project planning turns


into a frustrating game of Calendar Tetris. Working in cycles dras­

tically simplifies this problem. A cycle gives us a standard project


size both for shaping and scheduling.


Some companies use two-week cycles (aka “sprints”). We learned


that two weeks is too short to get anything meaningful done. Worse


than that, two-week cycles are extremely costly due to the plan­


ning overhead. The amount of work you get out of two weeks isn’t


worth the collective hours around the table to “sprint plan” or the

opportunity cost of breaking everyone’s momentum to re-group.


This led us to try longer cycles. We wanted a cycle that would be

long enough to finish a whole project, start to end. At the same time,


cycles need to be short enough to see the end from the beginning.


People need to feel the deadline looming in order to make trade
offs. If the deadline is too distant and abstract at the start, teams

will naturally wander and use time inefficiently until the deadline


starts to get closer and feel real.


After years of experimentation we arrived at six weeks. Six weeks is

long enough to finish something meaningful and still short enough


to see the end from the beginning.

##### Cool-down


If we were to run six-week cycles back to back, there wouldn’t be


any time to breathe and think about what’s next. The end of a cycle


is the worst time to meet and plan because everybody is too busy

finishing projects and making last-minute decisions in order to ship


on time.


Therefore, after each six-week cycle, we schedule two weeks for


cool-down. This is a period with no scheduled work where we can


breathe, meet as needed, and consider what to do next.


During cool-down, programmers and designers on project teams

are free to work on whatever they want. After working hard to ship


their six-week projects, they enjoy having time that’s under their

control. They use it to fix bugs, explore new ideas, or try out new


technical possibilities.

##### Team and project sizes

In addition to standardizing the length of our cycles, we also


roughly standardize the types of projects and teams that we bet on.


Our project teams consist of either one designer and two program­


mers or one designer and one programmer. They’re joined by a QA


person who does integration testing later in the cycle.


These teams will either spend the entire cycle working on one


project, or they’ll work on multiple smaller projects during the


cycle. We call the team that spends the cycle doing one project the


big batch team and the team working on a set of smaller projects


the small batch team. Small batch projects usually run one or two


weeks each. Small batch projects aren’t scheduled individually. It’s

up to the small batch team to figure out how to juggle the work so


they all ship before the end of the cycle.


Now that we have a standard way to think about capacity, we can


talk about how we decide what to schedule.
