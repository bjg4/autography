### **About the Author**

Ryan Singer has worked on all levels of the software stack, from UI


design to back-end programming to strategy.


Through over 17 years at Basecamp, he’s designed features used by


millions and invented processes the teams use to design, develop,


and ship the right things.


These days he’s focused on product strategy: understanding


what Basecamp’s customers are trying to do and how to make the

product fit them better.


Thanks for reading. I’d love to hear about your questions and expe­


riences as you try to apply the Shape Up method. Reach out to me
