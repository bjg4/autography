CHAPTER SEVEN

PRIORITIZING OPPORTUNITIES, NOT SOLUTIONS

“The build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes. It’s when they focus more on shipping and developing features rather than on the actual value those things produce.”

— Melissa Perri

“When people create maps of an unknowable, unpredictable world, they face strong temptations toward either overconfident knowing or overly cautious doubt. Wisdom consists of an attitude toward one’s beliefs, values, knowledge, and information that resists these temptations through an ongoing balance between knowing and doubt.”

— Karl Weick

I’m standing on the stage at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, looking out at a sea of product people. I’m wrapping up a talk about how product teams can manage stakeholders throughout the discovery process. It’s the last talk of the day at Mind the Product. All we have left is the after-party, and I want to leave the crowd with an important takeaway. “You are never one feature away from success…” The crowd erupts with cheers. But I’m not done. I wait patiently for the crowd to quiet down. I continue, “…and you never will be.” The energy in the room is electric. I know people need to hear it, but I also know that saying it isn’t enough.

For too long, product teams have defined their work as shipping the next release. When we engage with stakeholders, we talk about our roadmaps and our backlogs. During our performance reviews, we highlight all the great features we implemented. The vast majority of our conversations take place in the solution space. We assume that success comes from launching features. This is what product thought leader Melissa Perri calls “the build trap.”28

This obsession with producing outputs is strangling us. It’s why we spend countless hours prioritizing features, grooming backlogs, and micro-managing releases. The hard reality is that product strategy doesn’t happen in the solution space. Our customers don’t care about the majority of our feature releases. A solution-first mindset is good at producing output, but it rarely produces outcomes.

Instead, our customers care about solving their needs, pain points, and desires. Product strategy happens in the opportunity space. Strategy emerges from the decisions we make about which outcomes to pursue, customers to serve, and opportunities to address. Sadly, the vast majority of product teams rush past these decisions and jump straight to prioritizing features. We obsess about the competition instead of about our customers. Our strategy consists of playing catch-up, and, no matter how hard we work, we always seem to fall further and further behind.

Fortunately, there’s a better way. With a well-structured opportunity space (see Chapter 6), a product trio is now well positioned to make strategic decisions about which opportunities to address, which customers to serve, and which path to take toward their desired outcome. This chapter will show you how.

Focus on One Target Opportunity at a Time

In the Opportunity Mapping chapter (Chapter 6), you learned that, as you work vertically down the opportunity solution tree, you are deconstructing large, intractable opportunities into a series of smaller, more solvable sub-opportunities. The benefit of this work is that it helps us adopt an Agile mindset, working iteratively, delivering value over time, rather than delivering a large project after an extended period of time.

By addressing only one opportunity at a time, we unlock the ability to deliver value iteratively over time. If we spread ourselves too thin across many opportunities, we’ll find ourselves right back in the waterfall mindset of taking too long to deliver too much all at once. Instead, we want to solve one opportunity before moving on to the next.

Focusing on one opportunity at a time allows the trio to explore multiple solutions (more on that in Chapter 8), setting up good compare-and-contrast decisions. It’s also consistent with the kanban concept of limiting work in progress. Researchers at the University of Oulu in Finland conducted a literature review on the benefits of kanban and found that software teams that use kanban see an increase in quality and consistency in delivery and a decrease in customer complaints. They found that limiting work in progress was a key component of this success29.

To choose a target opportunity, you’ll need to assess and prioritize the opportunity space. However, you don’t need to assess every opportunity you encounter. Instead, you’ll use the tree structure to help you optimize your prioritization.

Using the Tree to Aid Decision Making

You’ll start by assessing your top-level opportunities—the parent opportunities on your opportunity solution tree. Drawing from what we learned in Chapter 2, you won’t be working with each top-level opportunity in isolation. You don’t want to ask, “Should we pursue this opportunity?” That’s a “whether or not” question that leads to poor decisions. It makes us susceptible to confirmation bias, and we forget to consider opportunity cost. Instead, you’ll compare and contrast the set of parent opportunities against each other.

In the next section, we’ll explore how to best assess sets of opportunities. For now, assume you can identify the highest priority. If your opportunity space is well structured (see Chapter 6), you can now ignore all but this branch of the tree for the rest of your assessment. If your chosen parent is the highest priority, then the highest-impact opportunity to address next will live under that branch.

Notice how a single decision, assessing and prioritizing your top-level opportunities, reduces the amount of assessing you have to do. We can effectively ignore the other branches of our tree and focus on assessing just our target branch. That’s the power of the tree structure.

We’ll now repeat our assessing-and-prioritizing exercise for the children of our primary top-level opportunity. We’ll compare and contrast the children against each other and choose a front runner. If our front runner has children, we’ll repeat the exercise again. We’ll keep iterating until we identify a target opportunity that has no children.

You always want to choose a leaf-node opportunity (i.e., one that has no children) because our goal is to deliver iterative value over time. We can do this by solving a series of smaller opportunities in succession rather than addressing sets of opportunities at once. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that your target opportunity will be easy to address. It simply means that you haven’t (yet) identified any sub-opportunities that contribute to addressing it.

Assessing a Set of Opportunities

I recommend that teams assess opportunities using the following criteria: opportunity sizing, market factors, company factors, and customer factors.

Opportunity sizing helps us answer the questions: How many customers are affected and how often? However, we don’t need to size each opportunity precisely. This can quickly turn into a never-ending data-gathering mission. Instead, we want to size a set of siblings against each other. For each set that we are considering, we want to ask, “Which of these opportunities affects the most customers?” and “the most often?” We can and should make rough estimates here. You can use behavioral data (e.g., site analytics, sales-funnel analytics), support tickets, sample surveys, or even your interview snapshots, to quickly evaluate which opportunities are impacting the most customers.

It’s important, however, to distinguish how many customers from how often. Every customer might be impacted by an opportunity, but the need or pain point might arise only occasionally. Addressing this opportunity will have a different impact than addressing an opportunity that impacts some customers all the time.

Market factors help us evaluate how addressing each opportunity might affect our position in the market. Depending on the competitive landscape, some opportunities might be table stakes, while others might be strategic differentiators. Choosing one over the other will depend on your current position in the market. A missing table stake could torpedo sales, while a strategic differentiator could open up new customer segments. The key is to consider how addressing each opportunity positions you against your competitors. With market factors, we also want to consider any external trends (both opportunities and threats) that might impact which opportunity we might choose.30 For example, our streaming-entertainment company might want to consider the impact of “cord-cutters” (i.e., the growing trend of cable subscribers canceling their service) on different opportunities. They might prioritize an opportunity like “I want to watch live sports” to grab some of this market.

Company factors help us evaluate the strategic impact of each opportunity for our company, business group, or team. Each organizational context is unique. Google might choose to address an opportunity that Apple would never touch. We need to consider our organizational context when assessing and prioritizing opportunities. We want to prioritize opportunities that support our company vision, mission, and strategic objectives over opportunities that don’t. We want to de-prioritize opportunities that conflict with our company values. We also want to consider the company’s political climate. We might need to spend a lot of political capital to gain support for a more controversial opportunity. If we aren’t willing to do that, we’ll want to choose another opportunity.

Company factors also apply at the business-group and team level. A business group might be your business unit, your department, your tribe, or even your product line. Your business group’s vision, mission, and strategic objectives might add additional constraints on what you may or may not choose. These same factors might apply at your team or squad level as well.

Across all three levels—company, business group, and team—you’ll also want to consider strengths and weaknesses. Some companies will be better positioned to tackle some opportunities over others. Some teams may have unique skills that give them an unfair advantage when tackling a specific opportunity. We want to take all of this into account when assessing and prioritizing opportunities.

Customer factors help us evaluate how important each opportunity is to our customers. If we interviewed and opportunity mapped well, every opportunity on our tree will represent a real customer need, pain point, or desire. However, not all opportunities are equally important to customers. We’ll want to assess how important each opportunity is to our customers and how satisfied they are with existing solutions.31 We want to prioritize important opportunities where satisfaction with the current solution is low, over opportunities that are less important or where satisfaction with current opportunities is high.

Embrace the Messiness

You might be tempted to score each opportunity based on the different factors (e.g., 2 out of 3 for sizing, 1 out of 3 for market factors, and so on) and then stack-rank your opportunities, much like you might do with features. Don’t do this. This is a messy, subjective decision, and you want to keep it that way.

Remember, you aren’t making absolute judgments. You are making relative judgments by comparing and contrasting sibling opportunities against each other. You don’t need to score each opportunity. This will take a lot of work, will be rife with assumptions, and won’t lead to a better decision. Instead, make a data-informed, subjective comparison for each set of factors.

There may not be a clear winner, and that’s okay. One opportunity might look like the winner based on sizing, and another might look like the winner based on company factors. Yet another might look like the winner based on customer factors. Your job as a team is to have a healthy debate. Consider the different dimensions, and make the best decision that you can for this moment in time. Think about each set of criteria as a different lens through which to view impact. Use the lenses to fuel your conversation.

When we turn a subjective, messy decision into a quantitative math formula, we are treating an ill-structured problem as if it were a well-structured problem. The problem with this strategy is that it will lead us to believe that there is one true, right answer. And there isn’t. Once we mathematize this process, we’ll stop thinking and go strictly by the numbers. We don’t want to do this.

Instead, we want to leave room for doubt. As Karl Weick, an educational psychologist at the University of Michigan, advises in the second opening quote, wisdom is finding the right balance between having confidence in what you know and leaving enough room for doubt in case you are wrong.32 That’s the balance we are looking for here. When we treat this like the messy, subjective decision that it is, we are leaving room for doubt, so that, down the road, if we learn we are addressing the wrong opportunity, we will be far more likely to course-correct.

Two-Way Door Decisions

When assessing and prioritizing the opportunity space, it’s important that we find the right balance between being data-informed and not getting stuck in analysis paralysis. It’s easy to fall into the trap of wanting more data, spending just a little bit more time, trying to get to a more perfect decision. However, we’ll learn more by making a decision and then seeing the consequences of having made that decision than we will from trying to think our way to the perfect decision.

Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, made this exact argument in his 2015 letter to shareholders,33 where he introduced the idea of Level 1 and Level 2 decisions. He describes a Level 1 decision as one that is hard to reverse, whereas a Level 2 decision is one that is easy to reverse. Bezos argues that we should be slow and cautious when making Level 1 decisions, but that we should move fast and not wait for perfect data when making Level 2 decisions.

I prefer the imagery of one-way door and two-way door decisions. With a one-way door decision, the idea is that, when we make the decision, we walk through the door. Upon entering the space on the other side of the door, we are able to see the consequences of our decisions. Unfortunately, because it’s a one-way door, if we don’t like what we see, we can’t turn around and walk out through the door again. This is what Bezos calls a “Level 1 decision.” For these types of decisions, we want to be cautious, data-driven, and deliberate in our decision-making.

With a two-way door decision, on the other hand, when we walk through the door, if we don’t like what we see, we get to turn around and undo our decision. This is what Bezos calls a “Level 2 decision.” He suggests that, with a two-way door decision, we’ll learn more by acting—walking through the door and seeing what’s on the other side—than we would by trying to imagine what’s on the other side of the door.

When we assess and prioritize the opportunity space, even though these are some of the most strategic decisions we make as a product trio, we are still making two-way door decisions. When you choose a target opportunity, you are choosing how to spend your next few days or weeks. You are not committing to addressing that opportunity. You are simply committing to exploring it further with your discovery work. If, as you proceed to explore solutions, you learn that this wasn’t the best decision (e.g., you learned something new, you found the solutions to be tougher than you imagined, you learned it wasn’t as important to customers as you thought), you’ll simply turn around and choose another target opportunity.

It’s important that we frame our discovery decisions as two-way door, reversible decisions. Lottie Bullens and colleagues, social psychologists at the University of Amsterdam, found in a series of studies that, when people viewed a decision as reversible, they continued to critically evaluate their decision after making it. In fact, they were more likely to see the negative attributes of their choice and the positive attributes of the alternatives after making the decision if they viewed it as a reversible decision. If they framed it as an irreversible decision, the opposite happened. People noticed only the positive attributes of their own choice and the negative attributes of the alternatives.34 If we want to stay open to being wrong and avoid confirmation bias, it’s critical that we think of our prioritization decisions as reversible decisions.

The beauty of a continuous discovery process is that we can always course-correct as we learn. So, as you assess and prioritize the opportunity space, relax. Make the best decision you can, given what you know today, and know that, if you got it wrong, we’ll simply revisit the decision when we need to.

Avoid These Common Anti-Patterns

As you assess and prioritize the opportunity space, be sure to avoid these common anti-patterns.

Delaying a decision until there is more data. Even when I remind teams that choosing a target opportunity is a two-way door decision and that, if all of the opportunities on your tree emerged from customer interviews, there are no wrong decisions, some teams still get bogged down in the data. They want to look into one more thing. Wait for one more data report. Ask one more person for input. The intent is good. We do want to be data-informed. But we also want to move forward. We’ll learn more from testing our decisions than we will from trying to make perfect decisions. The best way to prevent this type of analysis paralysis is to time-box your decision. Give yourself an hour or two or, at most, a day or two. Then decide, based on what you know today, and move on. Trust that you’ll course-correct if you get data down the road that tells you that you made a less-than-optimal decision.

Over-relying on one set of factors at the cost of the others. Some teams are all about opportunity sizing. Others focus exclusively on what’s most important to their customers. Many teams forget to consider company factors and choose opportunities that will never get organizational buy-in. The four sets of factors (opportunity sizing, market factors, company factors, and customer factors) are designed to be lenses to give you a different perspective on the decision. Use them all.

Working backwards from your expected conclusion. Some teams go into this exercise with a conclusion in mind. As a result, they don’t use the lenses to explore the possibilities and instead use them to justify their foregone conclusion. This is a waste of time. Go into this exercise with an open mind. You’ll be surprised by how often you come away from it with a new perspective.
