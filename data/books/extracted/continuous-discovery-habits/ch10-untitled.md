DISCOVERING OPPORTUNITIES

The next four habits will help you discover, structure, and prioritize the opportunity space. You’ll get introduced to three key artifacts that will help you build a shared understanding as you work to discover the best path to your desired outcome.

- You’ll start by building an experience map that reflects what you currently know about your customer (Chapter 4).
- Your experience map will guide you as you interview customers to discover specific opportunities. You’ll capture what you are learning from each interview on an interview snapshot (Chapter 5).
- You’ll map out and structure those opportunities on an opportunity solution tree (Chapter 6) and use the tree structure to help you assess and prioritize the opportunity space (Chapter 7).

These artifacts are not intended to be one-time activities. Instead, they’ll continue to evolve as your understanding of your customer’s context (your experience map) and their needs, pain points, and desires (the opportunity space on your opportunity solution tree) evolve.
