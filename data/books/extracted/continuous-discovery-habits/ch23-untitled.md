CHAPTER FIFTEEN

WHAT’S NEXT?

Congratulations! You’ve made it to the end of the book. However, this doesn’t have to be the end of your Continuous Discovery Habits journey. I know it can be hard to translate what you read in a book to your own work, so I’ve collected a number of resources to support you while you continue your journey.

Subscribe to the Product Talk monthly newsletter. Every month, we release two long-form articles about continuous discovery. One month, we might highlight the work of real-world product teams putting Continuous Discovery Habits into practice. The next, we might publish a deep-dive, how-to article to help you hone your craft. Our goal with every article is to give you actionable insights that you can put into practice the same day. Sign up at ProductTalk.org.

Join the Continuous Discovery Habits membership community. We learn best in community. If you want to surround yourself with like-minded peers who are also investing in their continuous discovery habits, come join us. Membership includes monthly community calls in which you can connect with like-minded peers and the Product Talk coaches, fireside chats with product people who are seeing success putting the continuous discovery habits into practice, access to the Worthy Reads library, and much more. Learn more at: Members.ProductTalk.org.

Join a Master Class: Throughout the year, we host live Master Classes designed to help you develop the continuous discovery habits covered in this book. These courses include live instruction with me, are limited to small groups so that you have plenty of time to get your questions answered, and feature lots of hands-on, small-group activities so that you can apply what you are learning while also connecting with like-minded peers.

Join a skills deep-dive course. We offer several Deep-Dive courses that go deep in one of the continuous discovery habits. Want to hone your skill in story-based interviewing? Our Continuous Interviewing course was designed to get you hands-on practice. Not sure how to structure the opportunity space? Our Opportunity Mapping course teaches you how to map out the opportunity space step by step. Our Deep-Dive courses are designed to get you deliberate practice with a core discovery skill. Explore all the options at Learn.ProductTalk.org
