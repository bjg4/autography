CHAPTER TWO

A COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR CONTINUOUS DISCOVERY

“Managers must convert society’s needs into opportunities for profitable business.”

— Peter Drucker

“If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”

— Albert Einstein

2016 was a tough year for the American bank Wells Fargo. Several regulatory organizations uncovered fraudulent activity at the bank. Bankers were opening checking, savings, and credit-card accounts on behalf of customers without their customers’ knowledge or prior approval. The news was picked up by newspapers across the country. It was a public-relations nightmare.

At first, Wells Fargo blamed individual branch employees, arguing the fraudulent activity was the result of isolated behavior. But under further scrutiny, it became clear that employees were under immense pressure from senior leadership to grow the average number of accounts held by each customer. For years, Wells Fargo was known for its cross-selling strategy, in which, once a customer opened one account with the firm, bankers would then work to grow that customer’s footprint. If the customer opened a checking and savings account, bankers would offer a credit card or a mortgage.

With time, however, this cross-selling strategy became more and more aggressive. Bankers were given quotas that were impossible to reach. Because these quotas were paired with lucrative incentives, bankers looked for ways to cheat the system. Under immense pressure from senior leadership, tempted by the lure of compelling incentives, many bankers opened fraudulent accounts on their customers’ behalf without their permission.

Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and faced lawsuits costing them billions of dollars as a result. The Wells Fargo story is a story of outcomes gone wrong. The company rightly started with a desired outcome: To increase the average number of accounts per customer. However, they didn’t pair this outcome mindset with a customer-centric mindset, that is critical for long-term product success.4

While Wells Fargo’s fraud is exceptional, the focus on outcomes at the cost of the customer is not uncommon. At many companies, there is a tension between business needs and customer needs. When you get bombarded with a handful of ads before you can start reading a newspaper article, it’s because the newspaper prioritized their need for ad revenue over the reader’s need for a pleasant reading experience. When you can’t watch your favorite sporting event because the broadcast rights didn’t allow it to be streamed in your region, the sports team prioritized their television revenue over their fans’ desire to watch the game. When hotels tack on a resort fee that isn’t visible at time of booking, the hotel is prioritizing their own short-term revenue needs over the traveler’s need for price transparency. Sadly, this conflict between business needs and customer needs is prevalent in every industry. But it doesn’t have to be this way.

Businesses do need to make a profit. That’s required for their survival. However, profit should not come at the cost of serving the customer. Renowned business consultant and author Peter Drucker, in the opening quote of this chapter, argues that the goal of a business is to “convert society’s needs into opportunities for a profitable business.” He argues that a company’s purpose is to serve the customer. Instead of framing business needs as at odds with customer needs, Drucker is aligning the two, by arguing that serving customers is how we generate profit. I couldn’t agree more. In this chapter, I’ll introduce a framework for continuous discovery that will ensure that you pursue business needs by addressing your customers’ needs.

Begin With the End in Mind

As our product-discovery methods evolve, we are shifting from an output mindset to an outcome mindset. Rather than obsessing about features (outputs), we are shifting our focus to the impact those features have on both our customers and our business (outcomes). Starting with outcomes, rather than outputs, is what lays the foundation for product success.

When a product trio is tasked with delivering an outcome, the business is clearly communicating what value the team can create for the business. And when the business leaves it up to the team to explore the best outputs that might drive that outcome, they are giving the team the latitude they need to create value for the customer. However, as we saw in the Wells Fargo story, we can’t take customer value for granted.

When a product trio is tasked with an outcome, they have a choice. They can choose to engage with customers, do the work required to truly understand their customers’ context, and focus on creating value for their customers. Or they can take shortcuts—they can focus on creating business value at the cost of customers. The organizational context in which the product trio works will have a big impact on which choice the product trio will make. Some teams, however, choose to take shortcuts because they simply don’t know another way of working. The framework in this chapter and the habits described in this book will help you resolve the tension between business needs and customer needs so that you can create value for your customers and your business.

The Challenge of Driving Outcomes

Most product trios don’t have a lot of experience with driving outcomes. They grew up in a world where they were told what to build. Or they were asked to generate outputs, with little thought for what impact those outputs had. So, when we shift from an output mindset to an outcome mindset, we have to relearn how to do our jobs.

Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as talking to customers every week. That’s a good start. But we also need to consider the rest of our continuous-discovery definition:

At a minimum, weekly touchpoints with customers

By the team building the product

Where they conduct small research activities

In pursuit of a desired outcome

I’ve met many teams who are good at talking to customers. But they forget that the purpose of these customer touchpoints is to conduct research in pursuit of a desired outcome. Those last two lines of the definition are critical. We aren’t doing research for research’s sake. We are doing research so that we can serve our customers in a way that creates value for our business.

Finding the best path to your desired outcome is what researchers call an “ill-structured problem”—also commonly called a “wicked problem.” Ill-structured problems are defined by having many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones. Much of the work when tackling an ill-structured problem is framing the problem itself.5 How we frame a problem has a big impact on how we might solve it. For example, in the Wells Fargo story, their leadership, whether implicitly or explicitly, had framed the problem as “grow customer accounts at all costs.” This framing opened the door to cheating. If, on the other hand, Wells Fargo had framed the problem as “create customers who want to open more accounts,” bankers would have been less likely to cheat.

If product trios tasked with delivering a desired outcome want to pursue business value by creating customer value, they’ll need to work to frame the problem in a customer-centric way. They’ll need to discover the customer needs, pain points, and desires that, if addressed, would drive their business outcome. For example, if Wells Fargo had learned what inspired customers to open new accounts, they might have found a customer-centric way to reach their outcome.

In this book, I’ll refer to customer needs, pain points, and desires collectively as “opportunities”—they represent opportunities to intervene in our customers’ lives in a positive way. Why don’t we call them “problems to solve”? In the product world, we don’t just solve customer problems. The word “problem” implies something needs fixing. However, we have many examples of products or services that don’t fix problems. Disneyland entertains me. Ice cream is delicious. Mountain biking is fun. These products address my desires. I could try to shoehorn these desires into needs—I need something to fill my time, I need nutrients, and I need exercise. However, writing a book, eating spinach, and going to the gym might be more effective ways of addressing those needs. The key difference here is that I enjoy Disneyland, ice cream, and mountain biking. These products were designed to address my desires, not solve my problems. So, to make sure this model is more inclusive of such products, I’ll use opportunities to represent customer needs, pain points, and desires collectively and the opportunity space to represent the problem space as well as the desire space.

To reach their desired outcome, a product trio must discover and explore the opportunity space. The opportunity space, however, is infinite. This is precisely what makes reaching our desired outcome an ill-structured problem. How the team defines and structures the opportunity space is exactly how they give structure to the ill-structured problem of reaching their desired outcome. David Jonassen, an educational psychologist from the University of Missouri, studied ill-structured problem-solving and highlights the importance of problem framing. How we frame an ill-structured problem impacts how we might solve it. Additionally, Jonassen suggests that we can’t simply start with one framing. Instead, he argues, good problem-solvers try out many framings, exploring how each impacts the solution space.6

The implication for product trios is that two of the most important steps for reaching our desired outcome are first, how we map out and structure the opportunity space, and second, how we select which opportunities to pursue. Unfortunately, many product trios skip these steps altogether. They start with an outcome and simply start generating ideas. We do have to get to solutions—shipping code is how we ship value to our customers and create value for our business. But the right problem framing will help to ensure that we explore and ultimately ship better solutions.

The Underlying Structure of Discovery

Back in 2016, I was coaching a product trio who were learning to adopt a continuous cadence for the first time. One day they told me, “Teresa, we are learning a lot of discovery tactics, but we have no idea what to do when. You always tell us our next steps. How are we supposed to do this on our own?” This question floored me. The last thing I wanted was to create a dependency on me. But I didn’t have an easy answer for them. How did I decide what to do next in discovery?

After some reflection7, I realized there’s an underlying structure to discovery that we can use to guide our work. It starts with defining a clear outcome—one that sets the scope for discovery. From there, we must discover and map out the opportunity space—this is what gives structure to the ill-structured problem of reaching our desired outcome. It’s the all-important problem framing that opens up the solution space. And finally, we need to discover the solutions that will address those opportunities and thus drive our desired outcome.

It sounds simple, but this structure helps us know what to do when. I encourage teams to visualize it using an opportunity solution tree (OST).

Opportunity solution trees are a simple way of visually representing the paths you might take to reach a desired outcome.

The root of the tree is your desired outcome—the business need that reflects how your team can create business value.

Next is the opportunity space. These are the customer needs, pain points, and desires that, if addressed, will drive your desired outcome.

Below the opportunity space is the solution space. This is where we’ll visually depict the solutions we are exploring.

Below the solution space are assumption tests. This is how we’ll evaluate which solutions will help us best create customer value in a way that drives business value.

Opportunity solution trees have a number of benefits. They help product trios:

- Resolve the tension between business needs and customer needs
- Build and maintain a shared understanding of how they might reach their desired outcome
- Adopt a continuous mindset
- Unlock better decision-making
- Unlock faster learning cycles
- Build confidence in knowing what to do next
- Unlock simpler stakeholder management

We’ll explore each of these benefits throughout this chapter.

OSTs Resolve the Tension Between Business Needs and Customer Needs

Opportunity solution trees help you resolve the tension between business needs and customer needs. You start by prioritizing your business need—creating value for your business is what ensures that your team can serve your customer over time. Next, the team should explore the customer needs, pain points, and desires that, if addressed, would drive that outcome. The key here is that the team is filtering the opportunity space by considering only the opportunities that have the potential to drive the business need. By mapping the opportunity space, the team is adopting a customer-centric framing for how they might reach their outcome.

The outcome and the opportunity space constrain the types of solutions the product trio might consider. This is what helps us avoid Wells Fargo’s fate and sets us up to create value for our customers and our business.

OSTs Help Build and Maintain a Shared Understanding Across Your Trio

For most of us, when we encounter a problem, we simply want to solve it. This desire comes from a place of good intent. We like to help people. However, this instinct often gets us into trouble. We don’t always remember to question the framing of the problem. We tend to fall in love with our first solution. We forget to ask, “How else might we solve this problem?”

These problems get compounded when working in teams. When we hear a problem, we each individually jump to a fast solution. When we disagree, we engage in fruitless opinion battles. These opinion battles encourage us to fall back on our organizational roles and claim decision authority (e.g., the product manager has the final say), instead of collaborating as a cross-functional team.

When a team takes the time to visualize their options, they build a shared understanding of how they might reach their desired outcome. If they maintain this visual as they learn week over week, they maintain that shared understanding, allowing them to collaborate over time. We know this collaboration is critical to product success.

OSTs Help Product Trios Adopt a Continuous Mindset

Shifting from a project mindset to a continuous mindset is hard. We tend to take our six-month-long waterfall project, carve it up into a series of two-week sprints, and call it “Agile.” But this isn’t Agile. Nor is it continuous. A continuous mindset requires that we deliver value every sprint. We create customer value by addressing unmet needs, resolving pain points, and satisfying desires.

The opportunity solution tree helps teams take large, project-sized opportunities and break them down into a series of smaller opportunities. As you work your way vertically down the tree, opportunities get smaller and smaller. Teams can then focus on solving one opportunity at a time. With time, as they address a series of smaller opportunities, these solutions start to address the bigger opportunity. The team learns to solve project-sized opportunities by solving smaller opportunities continuously.

OSTs Unlock Better Decision-Making

As product trios explore the best path to their desired outcome, they need to make key decisions along the way. It’s easy to get lost. When you bounce from tactic to tactic, it’s easy to forget what you’ve learned and what decisions you need to make next.

Chip and Dan Heath, in their book Decisive, outline four villains of decision-making that lead to poor decisions. The first villain is looking too narrowly at a problem. This is exactly why we want to explore multiple ways of framing the opportunity space. The second villain is looking for evidence that confirms our beliefs. This is commonly known as confirmation bias. We’ll be discussing this bias often throughout the book. We’ll be exploring several habits that will help us overcome this bias and ensure that we are considering both confirming and disconfirming evidence. The third villain is letting our short-term emotions affect our decisions. In the product world, this often shows up when we fall in love with our ideas. The fourth villain is overconfidence. This, too, is common in the product world. We are often sure our ideas will be runaway successes.

In Decisive, the Heath brothers outline many tactics for overcoming the four villains of decision-making, which is why it is the first book (after this one) that I recommend all product managers read. But the one tactic we’ll rely on over and over again throughout this book is their advice to avoid “whether or not” decisions. A “whether or not” decision is when we frame a problem as “Should we do this or not?” Product trios get caught up in “whether or not” decisions when we react to one customer need or pain point at a time, asking, “Should we stop everything and fix this problem?” We also encounter “whether or not” decisions when a stakeholder asks us to implement their pet feature, and we ask, “Should we stop everything and build this feature?” This is perhaps the most common mistake product trios make.

Instead of framing our decisions as “whether or not” decisions, this book will teach you to develop a “compare and contrast” mindset. Instead of asking, “Should we solve this customer need?” we’ll ask, “Which of these customer needs is most important for us to address right now?” We’ll compare and contrast our options. Instead of falling in love with our first idea, we’ll ask, “What else could we build?” or “How else might we address this opportunity?” Visualizing your options on an opportunity solution tree will help you catch when you are asking a “whether or not” question and will encourage you, instead, to shift to a compare-and-contrast question.

Even with this decision-making framework in hand, you’ll still need to guard against overconfidence (the fourth villain of decision-making). It’s easy to think that, when you’ve done discovery well, you can’t fail, but that’s simply not true (as we’ll see in a few stories throughout this book). Good discovery doesn’t prevent us from failing; it simply reduces the chance of failures. Failures will still happen. However, we can’t be afraid of failure. Product trios need to move forward and act on what they know today, while also being prepared to be wrong. The habits in this book will help you balance having confidence in what you know with doubting what you know, so that you can take action while still recognizing when you are on a risky path.8

And finally, we can’t talk about decision-making without tackling the dreaded problem of analysis paralysis. Many of the decisions we make in discovery feel like big strategic decisions. That’s because they often are. Deciding what to build has a big impact on our company strategy, on our success as a product team, and on our customers’ lives. However, most of the decisions that we make in discovery are reversible decisions. If we do the necessary work to test our decisions, we can quickly correct course when we find that we made the wrong decision. This gives us the luxury of moving quickly, rather than falling prey to analysis paralysis. The habits in this book will teach you how to make fast decisions and then quickly test to understand the consequences of those decisions. You’ll learn to adapt as you go rather than slow down to analyze.

Visualizing each decision point and the options that you considered on the opportunity solution tree will help you revisit past decisions when needed and will give you the context you need to course-correct.

OSTs Unlock Faster Learning Cycles

Many organizations try to define clear boundaries between the roles in a product trio. As a result, some have come to believe that product managers own defining the problem and that designers and software engineers own defining the solution. This sounds nice in theory, but it quickly falls apart in practice.

Nigel Cross, Emeritus Professor of Design Studies at the Open University in the United Kingdom, compared the knowledge, skills, and abilities of expert designers to novice designers (across a variety of disciplines) and found that the best designers evolve the problem space and the solution space together.9 As they explore potential solutions, they learn more about the problem, and, as they learn more about the problem, new solutions become possible. These two activities are intrinsically intertwined. The problem space and the solution space evolve together.

When we learn through testing that an idea won’t work, it’s not enough to move on to the next idea. We need to take time to reflect. We want to ask: “Based on my current understanding of my customer, I thought this solution would work. It didn’t. What did I misunderstand about my customer?” We then need to revise our understanding of the opportunity space before moving on to new solutions.10 When we do this, our next set of solutions get better. When we skip this step, we are simply guessing again, hoping that we’ll strike gold.

All of the habits and methods in this book are designed to be completed together by the product trio. The last thing we want to do is use our organizational roles as an excuse to artificially sever the ties between the problem space and the solution space. The product trio should be responsible for both.

By visually mapping out the opportunity space on an opportunity solution tree, a product trio is making their understanding of their customer explicit. When a solution fails, they can revisit this mapping to quickly revise that understanding.

OSTs Build Confidence in Knowing What to Do Next

As a product trio gains experience with opportunity solution trees, the shape of their tree will help guide their discovery work. The depth and breadth of the opportunity space reflects the team’s current understanding of their target customer. If our opportunity space is too shallow, it can guide us to do more customer interviews. A sprawling opportunity space, on the other hand, reminds us to narrow our focus. If we aren’t considering enough solutions for our target opportunity, we can hold an ideation session. If we don’t have enough assumption tests in flight, we can ramp up our testing.

While many teams work top-down, starting by defining a clear desired outcome, then mapping out the opportunity space, then considering solutions, and finally running assumption tests to evaluate those solutions, the best teams also work bottom-up. They use their assumption tests to help them evaluate their solutions and evolve the opportunity space. As they learn more about the opportunity space, their understanding of how they might reach their outcome (and how to best measure that outcome) will evolve. These teams work continuously, evolving the entire tree at once.

They interview week over week, continuing to explore the opportunity space, even after they’ve selected a target opportunity. They consider multiple solutions for their target opportunity, setting up good “compare and contrast” decisions. They run assumption tests across their solution set, in parallel, so that they don’t overcommit to less-than-optimal solutions. All along, they visualize their work on their opportunity solution tree, so that they can best assess what to do next.

OSTs Unlock Simpler Stakeholder Management

Organizational change happens unevenly. Even when a company tasks a team with a clear desired outcome, it can be hard for leaders to let go of dictating outputs. This is especially true during times of stress, when we tend to fall back on old habits. As a result, it’s not enough for a product trio to make evidence-based decisions about what to build; they also need to justify those decisions to key stakeholders along the way.

Unfortunately, many teams struggle to get this right. When it comes to sharing work with stakeholders, product trios tend to make two common mistakes. First, they share too much information—entire interview recordings or pages and pages of notes without any synthesis—expecting stakeholders to do the discovery work with them. Or second, they share too little of what they are learning, only highlighting their conclusions, often cherry-picking the research that best supports those conclusions. In the first instance, we are asking our stakeholders to do too much, and, in the second, we aren’t asking enough of them. The key to bringing stakeholders along is to show your work. You want to summarize what you are learning in a way that is easy to understand, that highlights your key decision points and the options that you considered, and creates space for them to give constructive feedback. A well-constructed opportunity solution tree does exactly this.

When sharing your discovery work with stakeholders, you can use your tree to first remind them of your desired outcome. Next, you can share what you’ve learned about your customer, by walking them through the opportunity space. The tree structure makes it easy to communicate the big picture while also diving into the details when needed. Your tree should visually show what solutions you are considering and what tests you are running to evaluate those solutions. Instead of communicating your conclusions (e.g., “We should build these solutions”), you are showing the thinking and learning that got you there. This allows your stakeholders to truly evaluate your work and to weigh in with information you may not have.

Building Out Your Opportunity Solution Tree

The habits in this book will help your trio build out and evolve an opportunity solution tree.

As you embark on the wandering paths of discovery, your tree will act as your roadmap, helping you find the best path to your desired outcome.
