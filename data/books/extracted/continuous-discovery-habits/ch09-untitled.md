CHAPTER THREE

FOCUSING ON OUTCOMES OVER OUTPUTS

“An outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results.”

— Josh Seiden, Outcomes Over Output

“Too often we have many competing goals that all seem equally important.”

— Christina Wodtke, Radical Focus

Sonja Martin, a product manager at tails.com—a Direct to Consumer business offering tailor-made dog food via a subscription service—and her team were tasked with improving a core business outcome, customer retention. While tails.com had many happy subscribers, they found that customer retention during the first 90 days of service was a critical indicator of long-term retention. Sonja’s team set out to improve retention measured at the 90-day mark. However, they quickly ran into challenges.

Even though they started with a clear outcome, Sonja’s team struggled to measure the impact of their product changes. As her team experimented with how to improve short-term retention, they found they had to wait 90 days before they could evaluate the impact of their ideas. As a result, they revised their metric to 30-day retention in an attempt to speed up their experiment cycles. This was also too long. They wanted to experiment week over week. So again, they changed their metric to 5-day retention. However, they were concerned that 5-day retention might not be a leading indicator of 30-day, 90-day, or long-term retention. So, while it allowed them to experiment faster, they weren’t sure if they were driving their business outcome.

During their customer interviews, Sonja’s team uncovered two primary factors that led to customer churn. First, not all tails.com customers understood the value of tailor-made dog food, and, second, some dogs simply didn’t like the food. Sonja’s team realized that they could prevent churn, and thus increase retention, if they focused on increasing the perceived value of tailor-made dog food and if they increased the number of dogs that liked the food. Their customer interviews helped them identify two product outcomes that were more actionable—they could measure their impact on both metrics right away, and they believed if they drove both, they would, in turn, drive their business outcome of increasing retention.11

Sonja’s story illustrates many of the challenges that arise when shifting to an outcome mindset. It’s not as simple as choosing a metric and running with it. Teams tasked with a new outcome often have no idea how to measure that outcome, how to impact it, or even if it’s the right outcome to be pursuing. Lagging indicators like 90-day retention make it hard to measure the impact of fast experiment cycles. Product teams often have to do some discovery work to identify the connections between product outcomes (the metrics they can influence) and business outcomes (the metrics that drive the business). This chapter will help you translate business outcomes into product outcomes you can deliver, negotiate appropriate product outcomes with your leadership team, and determine when to set learning goals versus performance goals.

Why Outcomes?

Business thought leaders have been advocating for managing by outcomes for decades. Peter Drucker, a renowned managerial thought leader, wrote about its benefits countless times12. Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, utilized the practice at Intel and wrote about it in his best-selling book High Output Management. More recently, Google, Google Ventures13, and John Doerr14, a venture capital partner at Kleiner Perkins, have popularized the topic again with their advocacy for objectives and key results (OKRs)15, one flavor of managing by outcomes. You’ll hear from prominent thought leaders in most industries and broadly across the technology sector (including from me) that shifting from dictating outputs to managing by outcomes is critical to a company’s success.

When we manage by outcomes, we give our teams the autonomy, responsibility, and ownership to chart their own path. Instead of asking them to deliver a fixed roadmap full of features by a specific date in time, we are asking them to solve a customer problem or to address a business need. The key distinction with this strategy over traditional roadmaps is that we are giving the team the autonomy to find the best solution. If they are truly a continuous-discovery team, the product trio has a depth of customer and technology knowledge, giving them an advantage when it comes to making decisions about how to solve specific problems.

Additionally, this strategy leaves room for doubt. A fixed roadmap communicates false certainty. It says we know these are the right features to build, even though we know from experience their impact will likely fall short. An outcome communicates uncertainty. It says, We know we need this problem solved, but we don’t know the best way to solve it. It gives the product trio the latitude they need to explore and pivot when needed. If the product trio finds flaws with their initial solution, they can quickly shift to a new idea, often trying several before they ultimately find what will drive the desired outcome.

Finally, managing by outcomes communicates to the team how they should be measuring success. A clear outcome helps a team align around the work they should be prioritizing, it helps them choose the right customer opportunities to address, and it helps them measure the impact of their experiments. Without a clear outcome, discovery work can be never-ending, fruitless, and frustrating.

All of this sounds fantastic. Is managing by outcomes really as good as it sounds? This is a hard question to answer. Industry best practices are clear. The best teams are adopting an outcome-focused mindset. However, the research is limited and conflicting. In this chapter, we’ll start with what we can learn from industry practice, and then we’ll look at how the research either supports or refutes that practice.

Exploring Different Types of Outcomes

Managing by outcomes is only as effective as the outcomes themselves. If we choose the wrong outcomes, we’ll still get the wrong results. When considering outcomes for specific teams, it helps to distinguish between business outcomes, product outcomes, and traction metrics. A business outcome measures how well the business is progressing. A product outcome measures how well the product is moving the business forward. A traction metric measures usage of a specific feature or workflow in the product.

Business outcomes start with financial metrics (e.g., grow revenue, reduce costs), but they can also represent strategic initiatives (e.g., grow market share in a specific region, increase sales to a new customer segment). Many business outcomes, however, are lagging indicators. They measure something after it has happened. It’s hard for lagging indicators to guide a team’s work because it puts them in react mode, rather than empowers them to proactively drive results. For Sonja’s team, 90-day retention was a lagging indicator of customer satisfaction with the service. By the time the team was able to measure the impact of their product changes, customers had already churned. Therefore, we want to identify leading indicators that predict the direction of the lagging indicator. Sonja’s team believed that increasing the perceived value of tailor-made dog food and increasing the number of dogs who liked the food were leading indicators of customer retention. Assigning a team a leading indicator is always better than assigning a lagging indicator.

As a general rule, product trios will make more progress on a product outcome rather than a business outcome. Remember, product outcomes measure how well the product moves the business forward. By definition, a product outcome is within the product trio’s span of control. Business outcomes, on the other hand, often require coordination across many business functions. For example, suppose Sonja’s team discovered that, in addition to some customers not understanding the value of tailor-made dog food and some dogs not liking the food, poor customer-support response times and surprise price increases that occurred after their trial period ended also influenced their high churn rate. In this case, product, marketing, and customer support might need to coordinate their efforts to increase retention.

Coordination isn’t bad. In fact, most of the work that we do will require coordination across teams. However, we can increase the accountability of each team by assigning a metric that is relevant to their own work. In this example, we might ask the product team to increase the number of dogs who like the food (something within the product team’s span of control), whereas we might ask the marketing team to increase the transparency of the pricing after the trial ends, and we might ask the customer-support team to decrease their average response times. All three groups are contributing to the business outcome of increasing customer retention, but each is doing so in the way that they can best contribute.

Assigning product outcomes to product trios increases a sense of responsibility and ownership. If a product team is assigned a business outcome, it’s easy for the trio to blame the marketing or customer-support team for not hitting their goal. However, if they are assigned a product outcome, they alone are responsible for driving results. When multiple teams are assigned the same outcome, it’s easy to shift blame for lack of progress.

Finally, when setting product outcomes, we want to make sure that we are giving the product trio enough latitude to explore. This is where the distinction between product outcomes and traction metrics can be helpful. It’s also a key delineation between an outcome mindset and an output mindset. If Sonja’s team believes more dogs would like the food if their owners had a better transition plan, why not get more specific with the outcome? For example, they could launch a transition calendar and measure engagement with that calendar as their outcome. This strategy, however, assumes that the transition calendar is the right output. If it’s not—if it turns out that customers don’t want to use the transition calendar—then Sonja’s team is stuck. They don’t have the latitude to explore alternative solutions. Even though it looks like they were focused on an outcome (engagement with the transition calendar), they were really fixated on an output (the transition calendar itself).

When we assign traction metrics to product trios, we run the risk of painting them into a corner by limiting the types of decisions that they can make. Product outcomes, generally, give product trios far more latitude to explore and will enable them to make the decisions they need to ultimately drive business outcomes. However, there are two instances in which it is appropriate to assign traction metrics to your team.

First, assign traction metrics to more junior product trios. Improving a traction metric is more of an optimization challenge than a wide-open discovery challenge and is a great way for a junior team to get some experience with discovery methods before giving them more responsibility. For your more mature teams, however, stick with product outcomes.

Second, if you have a mature product and you have a traction metric that you know is critical to your company’s success, it makes sense to assign this traction metric to an optimization team. For example, Sonja’s team may already know that customers want to use the transition calendar—perhaps they use it every day—but the recommended schedule isn’t as effective as they hoped it would be. In this case, it might make sense to have a team focused on optimizing the schedule. If the broader discovery questions have already been answered, then it’s perfectly fine to assign a traction metric to a team. The key is to use traction metrics only when you are optimizing a solution and not when the intent is to discover new solutions. In those instances, a product outcome is a better fit.

Outcomes Are the Result of a Two-Way Negotiation

Setting a team’s outcome should be a two-way negotiation between the product leader (e.g., Chief Product Officer, Vice President of Product, etc.) and the product trio.

The product leader brings the across-the-business view of the organization to the conversation and should communicate what’s most important for the business at this moment in time. But to be clear, the product leader should not be dictating solutions. Instead, the leader should be identifying an appropriate product outcome for the trio to focus on. Outcomes are a good way for the leader to communicate strategic intent. For example, if Sonja’s team is focused on increasing the number of dogs who like the food, her product leader can encourage her to keep focusing on the number of dogs who like the food broadly. Or, based on the strategic needs of the business, the leader might refine this outcome to have the team focus on specific breeds or strategic geographic regions. The key is that the leader should not narrow the scope so much that the team is tasked with a traction metric—engagement with the transition calendar.

The product trio brings customer and technology knowledge to the conversation and should communicate how much the team can move the metric in the designated period of time (usually one calendar quarter). The trio should not be required to communicate what solutions they will build at this time, as this should emerge from discovery.

For example, Sonja’s team, if asked to focus on a specific customer segment, might summarize what they know about that customer segment, share how successful past attempts to get dogs to like the food in that customer segment have been, and estimate how much impact they can have on the metric in the designated time period (e.g., we can increase the number of dogs in that segment who like the food by 10% in the next three months).

This then sets the stage for the two-way negotiation. If the business needs the team to have a bigger impact on the outcome, the trio will need to adjust their strategy to be more ambitious, and the product leader will need to understand that more ambitious outcomes carry more risk. The team will need to make bigger bets to increase their chance of success, but these bigger bets typically come with a higher chance of failure. Similarly, the product leader and product trio can negotiate resources (e.g., adding engineers to the team) and/or remove competing tasks from the team’s backlog, giving them more time to focus on delivering their outcome.

A particular scenario of note is when teams are assigned an outcome for the first time—as we saw in Sonja’s story. In these cases, the product trio will need some time to learn what might move the metric. This is why a stable product trio focused on the same outcome over time is so critical. Every time we mix up the team or change the outcome, we take a learning tax as the team gets up to speed.

Encouraging a two-way negotiation between the product leader and the product trio ensures that the right organizational knowledge is captured during the selection of the outcome. It, however, has another benefit. Bianca Green, business faculty at University of Twente (in the Netherlands), and her colleagues found that teams who participated in the setting of their own outcomes took more initiative and thus performed better than colleagues who were not involved in setting their outcomes16. This is an area where the research supports industry best practice.

Do You Need S.M.A.R.T. Goals?

Common goal-setting advice encourages us to set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T.) goals. The research on goal setting, however, muddies the waters.

Researchers have found that teams that set specific, challenging goals outperform teams who don’t. Challenging goals create focus, inspire effort and persistence, and help to surface relevant organizational knowledge. However, there are some caveats. The team has to believe that they can achieve the goal, and they need to be committed to the goal, further supporting the idea that teams need to be involved in defining their own outcomes. Teams also need continuous feedback on their progress toward their goal, supporting the argument that goals should be measurable.17

However, much of this goal-setting research was conducted using simple, straightforward tasks. More recent research on goal setting involving more complex tasks, like the ones product trios face, found that challenging goals can decrease performance if the team doesn’t have strategies for how to achieve their goal. These studies found that encouraging teams to “do their best” was more effective than setting specific, challenging goals. Additionally, these studies found that setting an initial learning goal (e.g., discover the strategies that might work) was more effective than setting a performance goal. Only once appropriate strategies were identified did performance increase with a specific, challenging performance goal.18

This research suggests that product trios, when faced with a new outcome, should first start with a learning goal (e.g., discover the opportunities that will drive engagement) before being tasked with a performance goal (e.g., increase engagement by 10%). This approach can be particularly helpful because it’s common to have uncertainty around the best way to measure your outcome. We often need to do some discovery to learn how to best measure a product outcome. For example, when Sonja’s team started investigating retention as an outcome, they had no idea what they would uncover. Rather than spinning their wheels trying to define the perfect, specific, measurable retention metric, her team focused on learning what led to churn and used that knowledge to revise their metric over time.

S.M.A.R.T. goals play a role and are common for trios that have experience with their product outcomes. But it’s not one-size-fits-all. It’s perfectly fine to start with a learning goal and work your way toward a S.M.A.R.T. performance goal.

A Guide for Product Trios

Product trios tend to fall into four categories when it comes to setting outcomes: 1) they are asked to deliver outputs and don’t work toward outcomes (this is, by far, the most common scenario); 2) their product leader sets their outcome with little input from the team; 3) the product trio sets their own outcomes with little input from their product leader; 4) the product trio is negotiating their outcomes with their leaders as described in this chapter.

If you are being asked to deliver outputs with no regard for outcomes, try these tips to shift toward a more outcome-focused mindset:

- When your product leader assigns a new initiative to your product trio, ask your leader to share more of the business context with you. Explore these questions:

Who is the target customer for this initiative?
What business outcome are we trying to drive with this initiative?
Why do we think this initiative will drive that outcome? (Be careful with Why? questions. They can put some leaders on the defensive. Use your best judgment, based on your knowledge of your specific leader.)
- Who is the target customer for this initiative?
- What business outcome are we trying to drive with this initiative?
- Why do we think this initiative will drive that outcome? (Be careful with Why? questions. They can put some leaders on the defensive. Use your best judgment, based on your knowledge of your specific leader.)
- Try to connect the dots between the business outcome and potential product outcomes. Can you clearly define how this new initiative will impact a product outcome? Is that outcome a leading indicator of the lagging indicator, business outcome?

If your product leader is asking you to deliver an outcome with no input from your team, try these tips to shift to a two-way negotiation:

- If you are being asked to deliver a business outcome, try mapping out which product outcomes might drive that business outcome, and get feedback from your leader.
- If you are being asked to deliver a product outcome, ask your leader for more of the business context. Try asking, “What business outcomes are we trying to drive with this product outcome?”
- In either case, clearly communicate how far you think you can get in the allotted time.

If your team is setting their own outcome with no input from the product leader, try these tips to shift to a two-way negotiation:

- Before you set your own outcome, ask your product leader for more business context. Try these questions:

What’s most important to the business right now? Try to frame this conversation in terms of business outcomes.
Is there a customer segment that is more important than other customer segments?
Are there strategic initiatives we should know about?
- What’s most important to the business right now? Try to frame this conversation in terms of business outcomes.
- Is there a customer segment that is more important than other customer segments?
- Are there strategic initiatives we should know about?
- Use the information you gain to map out the most important business outcomes and what product outcomes might drive those business outcomes. Get feedback from your leader.
- Choose a product outcome that your team has the most influence over.

If your product trio is already negotiating outcomes with your product leader, congratulations! However, remember to keep these tips in mind as you set outcomes with your leader:

- Is your team being tasked with a product outcome and not a business outcome or a traction metric?
- If you are being tasked with a traction metric, is the metric well known? Have you already confirmed that your customers want to exhibit the behavior being tracked?
- If it’s the first time you are working on a new metric, are you starting with a learning goal (e.g., discover the relevant opportunities) before committing to a challenging performance goal?
- If you have experience with the metric, have you set a specific and challenging goal?

Avoid These Common Anti-Patterns

When setting product outcomes, avoid these common anti-patterns. Anti-patterns are common patterns that should be avoided.

Pursuing too many outcomes at once. Most of us are overly optimistic about what we can achieve in a short period of time. No matter how hard we work, our companies will always ask more of us. Put these two together, and we often see product trios pursuing multiple outcomes at once. What happens when we do this is that we spread ourselves too thin. We make incremental progress (at best) on some of our outcomes but rarely have a big impact on any of our outcomes. Most teams will have more of an impact by focusing on one outcome at a time.

Ping-ponging from one outcome to another. Because many businesses have developed fire-fighting cultures—where every customer complaint is treated like a crisis—it’s common for product trios to ping-pong from one outcome to the next, quarter to quarter. However, you’ve already learned that it takes time to learn how to impact a new outcome. When we ping-pong from outcome to outcome, we never reap the benefits of this learning curve. Instead, set an outcome for your team, and focus on it for a few quarters. You’ll be amazed at how much impact you have in the second and third quarters after you’ve had some time to learn and explore.

Setting individual outcomes instead of product-trio outcomes. Because product managers, designers, and software engineers typically report up, to their respective departments, it’s not uncommon for a product trio to get pulled in three different directions, with each member tasked with a different goal. Perhaps the product manager is tasked with a business outcome, the designer is tasked with a usability outcome, and the engineer is tasked with a technical-performance outcome. This is most common at companies that tie outcomes to compensation. However, it has a detrimental effect. The goal is for the product trio to collaborate to achieve product outcomes that drive business outcomes. This isn’t possible if each member is focused on their own goal. Instead of setting individual outcomes, set team outcomes.

Choosing an output as an outcome. Shifting to an outcome mindset is harder than it looks. We spend most of our time talking about outputs. So, it’s not surprising that we tend to confuse the two. Even when teams intend to choose an outcome, they often fall into the trap of selecting an output. I see teams set their outcome as “Launch an Android app” instead of “Increase mobile engagement” or “Get to feature parity on the new tech stack” instead of “Transition customer to the new tech stack.” A good place to start is to make sure your outcome represents a number even if you aren’t sure yet how to measure it. But even then, outputs can creep in. I worked with a team that helped students choose university courses who set their outcome as “Increase the number of course reviews on our platform.” When I asked them what the impact of more reviews was, they answered, “More students would see courses with reviews.” That’s not necessarily true. The team could have increased the number of reviews on their platform, but if they all clustered around a small number of courses, or if they were all on courses that students didn’t view, they wouldn’t have an impact. A better outcome is “Increase the number of course views that include reviews.” To shift your outcome from less of an output to more of an outcome, question the impact it will have.

Focusing on one outcome to the detriment of all else. Like we saw in the Wells Fargo story, focusing on one metric at the cost of all else can quickly derail a team and company. In addition to your primary outcome, a team needs to monitor health metrics to ensure they aren’t causing detrimental effects elsewhere. For example, customer-acquisition goals are often paired with customer-satisfaction metrics to ensure that we aren’t acquiring unhappy customers. To be clear, this doesn’t mean one team is focused on both acquisition and satisfaction at the same time. It means their goal is to increase acquisition without negatively impacting satisfaction.
