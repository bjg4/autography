8     Karl Weick, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, defines this balance of having confidence in what you know with doubting what you know as the “essence of wisdom.” See: “Karl Weick. The Attitude of Wisdom: Ambivalence as the Optimal Compromise.” Published in Organizational Wisdom and Executive Courage.

10   This isn’t unique to design. John Dewey, an American educational philosopher, argues that this is the key to strong critical thinking. When we encounter something that surprises us (like a failed solution), we need to critically examine the beliefs that led to that surprise so that we can update them. If you want to learn more about Dewey’s thoughts on critical thinking, see his book How We Think.

45   Daniel Kahneman discusses confirmation bias and many other cognitive biases in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow. Chip and Dan Heath also dive into confirmation bias in Decisive.

46   Robert Cialdini has a great explanation of the escalation of commitment in his book Influence.

47   The idea that a successful product is viable, feasible, and desirable has been around for years in the product industry. In trying to track down the origin, many people referred me to the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit. However, it may have been used even earlier by Anthony Ulwick, when he introduced the “Jobs to be Done” framework.

48   Some thought leaders consider feasibility as technical feasibility alone and categorize legal, security, and compliance concerns as viability assumptions. To me, they make more sense as feasibility assumptions. But how we categorize them doesn’t really matter. What matters is that we enumerate them, question them, and, when needed, test them.
