CHAPTER NINE

IDENTIFYING HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS

“We loosely define an iteration in discovery as trying out at least one new idea or approach…To set your expectations, teams competent in modern discovery techniques can generally test on the order of 10–20 iterations per week.”

— Marty Cagan, INSPIRED

“Just assume that you are being overconfident, and give yourself a healthy margin of error.”

— Chip and Dan Heath, Decisive

I was reading the news one morning when I encountered a story about an affordable housing project in Portland, Oregon (where I live). For decades, the city invested in gentrification policies that resulted in the displacement of many underserved families from Portland’s historically Black neighborhood. To try to rectify the damage done, the city invested millions of dollars into a condominium building designed to help some of these displaced families return to their neighborhood.

The article, however, was critical of the project. Even though the city worked with the developer, granting tax breaks in exchange for offering the condos at below market rate, and the condos were available only to displaced residents, the displaced families were not opting to buy the condos. Years into the project, long after the city had estimated the building would be at full capacity, most units were not sold. In the end, the city had no choice but to let the developer sell the units on the open market.

This story upset me. Tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money was spent, with little impact. The city council had the best of intentions and tried to do the right thing, but the impact of their project fell short. Why did this happen?

The answer is simple. The city council and the real estate developer made a number of assumptions about what displaced families wanted for housing, and neither thought to test those assumptions. The developer built a building consisting primarily of one- and two-bedroom units. Both the city council and the developer thought this was how they could maximize impact and help the most families. Unfortunately, most of the displaced families were families of four or more. One- or two-bedroom condos wouldn’t work for them. The city spent millions of dollars building the wrong product for the outcome they wanted.

Sadly, the city of Portland is not the only organization to make this mistake. Every product team has, at one time or another, found themselves facing the hard reality that they spent time, energy, and money building the wrong product. Why does this happen? This chapter will explore why so many teams find themselves in this situation and provide a reliable process for reducing the chance that it will happen to you.

Be Prepared to Be Wrong

Daniel Kahneman, in Thinking, Fast and Slow, introduced us to the idea of cognitive biases—mental shortcuts that, while often helpful, sometimes get us into trouble. In the Portland affordable-housing story (and in many others like it), we are seeing an interplay of two cognitive biases—confirmation bias and the escalation of commitment. Confirmation bias45 means we are more likely to seek out confirming evidence than we are to seek out disconfirming evidence. We pay attention to and remember the data that supports our perspective and often ignore or forget the data that undermines our perspective. Both the city and the developer were excited by the positive feedback they got on their project but overlooked the negative feedback. The escalation of commitment46 is a bias in which the more we invest in an idea, the more committed we become to that idea. The more the city explored this idea (and this idea alone), the more committed to the idea they became—despite its flaws.

Product teams are particularly susceptible to confirmation bias and the escalation of commitment. We tend to fall in love with our ideas. We often have to defend our ideas to stakeholders, further entrenching our commitment to our ideas. We tend to seek out why our ideas will work and forget to explore why they might not work. As a result, we are often overconfident about the success of our ideas.

Chip and Dan Heath, authors of Decisive (introduced in Chapter 2), advise that, if we want to avoid overconfidence and make better decisions, we need to be prepared to be wrong. You’ve already learned some techniques to help you adopt a “prepare to be wrong” mindset. In Chapter 7, you learned to compare and contrast opportunities, so that you aren’t overcommitting to one. In Chapter 8, you whittled your ideas down to three, again so that you don’t overcommit to one. In this and the next chapter, we’ll explore how working with a set of ideas (that all have the potential to solve the same target opportunity) will help us compare and contrast the ideas against each other, helping us to avoid confirmation bias and the escalation of commitment.

However, the way most teams test ideas isn’t feasible when working with a set of ideas. We can’t build three ideas for the same target opportunity and A/B test them to see which is the most effective. It would take too long. More often than not, designing and building a testable prototype of each idea will take more time than we have. Instead, we need to learn how to quickly test our ideas through fast iterations.

In the opening quote of this chapter, Marty Cagan, author of INSPIRED, highlights that the best product teams complete a dozen or more discovery iterations every week. This pace is possible only when we step away from the concept of testing ideas and instead focus on testing the assumptions that need to be true in order for our ideas to succeed. By explicitly enumerating our assumptions, we can start to look for both confirming and disconfirming evidence to either support or refute each assumption. Additionally, assumption testing is generally quicker than idea testing, and the faster pace helps us to guard against the escalation of commitment. The less time we invest in an idea, the less likely we are to fall in love with it.

The biggest barrier to testing assumptions is becoming aware of the assumptions we are making. This chapter will enumerate several strategies for helping you to identify the hidden assumptions behind your solution ideas.

Types of Assumptions

Assumptions come in all shapes and sizes. As product trios, we are primarily concerned with assumptions in the following categories:47

Desirability assumptions: Does anyone want it? Will our customers get value from it? As we create solutions, we assume that our customers will want to use our solution, that they will be willing to do the things that we need them to do, and that they’ll trust us to provide those solutions. All of these types of assumptions fall into the desirability category.

Viability assumptions: Should we build it? There are many ideas that will work for our customers but won’t work for our business. If we want to continue to serve customers over time, we need to make sure that our solutions are viable—that they create a return for our business. This typically means that the idea will generate more revenue than it will cost to build, service, and maintain. However, some ideas are designed to be loss leaders and instead contribute to another business goal besides revenue. But somewhere down the line, the idea must create enough value for the business to be worth the effort to create and maintain.

Feasibility assumptions: Can we build it? We primarily think about feasibility as technical feasibility. Is it technically possible? Feasibility assumptions, however, can also include, “What’s feasible for our business?” For example, will our legal or security team allow for it? Will our culture support it? Does it comply with regulations?48

Usability assumptions: Is it usable? Can customers find what they need? Will they understand how to use it or what they need to do? Are they able to do what we need them to do? Is it accessible?

Ethical assumptions: Is there any potential harm in building this idea? This is an area that is grossly underdeveloped for many product trios. As an industry, we need to do a better job of asking questions like: What data are we collecting? How are we storing it? How are we using it? If our customers had full transparency to those answers, would they be okay with it?

But this category isn’t limited to data usage. While some products or services have clear potential harm—think autonomous vehicles—even more pedestrian products have the potential for harm. Reading the news has the potential to change our mood or disrupt our day. Facebook has the potential to inspire FOMO, imposter syndrome, or a feeling of falling behind our peers, not to mention it’s habit-forming in a way that may be detrimental to our well-being. Every product introduces some potential for harm. As product trios, we don’t always need to mitigate every potential area for harm, but we should be aware of the impact our products and services are having and ask how we can reduce the potential harm.

Story Map to Get Clarity

It’s hard to enumerate our assumptions if we aren’t specific about what our ideas mean. After ideating, our ideas tend to be vague concepts. You can fit only so many words on a sticky note (virtual or physical). Even if you’ve taken the time to describe your ideas, odds are each person in your trio is interpreting the idea differently. This means that each person is making their own assumptions about how the idea will work. It’s hard to test your underlying assumptions when you don’t yet agree on what those assumptions are.

One of the best ways to align as a team around what your ideas mean is to story map them. Story mapping is a popular technique in which teams map out each step end-users have to take to get value from a product or service.49 Story mapping forces you to get specific about how an idea will work and what you expect your end-users will do. While many teams use story mapping to align around product requirements, it’s also a great technique for helping us to surface underlying assumptions.

To story map your ideas:

Start by assuming the solution already exists. You aren’t story mapping what it will take to implement an idea. Instead, you are mapping what end-users will do to get value from the solution once it exists in the world.

Identify the key actors. Who needs to interact with whom for the idea to work? Some products like Slack or Facebook require that two or more end-users interact with each other for anyone to get value from the product. If this is the case, you’ll want to represent multiple end-users in your story map. In two-sided marketplaces, you might have different types of end-users (e.g., buyers and sellers). In some products or services, the interface or software itself may be an actor in your map (e.g., for an end-user conversing with a chatbot, the chatbot should be listed as a player in the story map).

Map out the steps each actor has to take for anyone to get value from the solution. Be specific. What does each actor need to do in order for someone to get value from the solution? For example, an actor has to engage with a chatbot by asking a question or making a request, the chatbot then needs to respond, and so on.

Sequence the steps horizontally over time. Lay out the steps horizontally one after the other. Sequence them in the order they need to happen. You may need to jump back and forth between players if they need to take turns taking actions. It’s okay if some steps are optional. List them in the map where they might occur. If an end-user can choose multiple paths, map out the successful path. If there are multiple successful paths, map them out sequentially.

Let’s walk through an example. Suppose we are working at our streaming-entertainment company, and we are exploring three different solutions (setting up a good compare-and-contrast decision) for the target opportunity “I want to watch live sports.”

1. Integrate local networks (e.g., ABC, CBS, NBC) into our service
2. License broadcast rights directly from the different sports leagues and serve the sporting events up ourselves
3. Bundle our streaming service with a partner who streams live sports

To story map our first idea—integrating local networks—we need to start by identifying the key players. In this case, it’s easy to make the mistake of thinking our key players are our business-development folks and their equivalent at the respective local channel providers. But remember, with story mapping, we want to assume the solution already exists. We aren’t story mapping what it would take to build the service—we are story mapping what the key players need to do for our consumer to get value from it.

So, in this case, our key players might be the sports consumer (i.e., our subscriber), our streaming platform, and any number of local TV channel partners. Our story map might include the following steps:

- Our subscriber comes to our platform to watch live sports.
- Our platform has live sports options for our subscriber to choose from.
- Our subscriber browses the options and chooses a sport that is currently on a local TV channel.
- Our local channel provider’s content is available to stream.
- Our subscriber watches live sports.

Now, even though this story map is quite simple, we may still need to make some critical decisions along the way. Can we offer the ability to search for a specific sport or a specific sporting event on our platform? In other words, can the local provider share their listings with us in a format that we can integrate into our own search results? Or does the subscriber need to know the game they want to watch is on NBC and they need to search for NBC? We don’t have to know all the answers right now.

Instead, we want to story map what we think would be the best solution based on what we know today. You can see that, in the above map, we assumed that the sports search would happen on the streaming-entertainment platform. We are assuming that’s possible. That’s okay. We have to make assumptions before we can test assumptions. But don’t worry about whether you are getting everything exactly right. We’ll have plenty of time to iterate and refine our ideas as we test our assumptions. This is merely a starting point.

Use Your Story Maps to Generate Assumptions

Now that your product trio has a clear concept of what your idea means, you can use your story map to uncover hidden assumptions. Throughout your story map, every time you assume that an end-user will do something, you are making desirability assumptions (i.e., that your user wants to do what you are asking them to do and that they are willing to do it), usability assumptions (i.e., your user understands what needs to be done and is able to do it), and feasibility assumptions (i.e., you can build whatever is required to support each step of the map). You can literally go step by step through your story map and generate dozens of assumptions.

Let’s return to our example to see how this works. From our first step of the story map, “Our subscriber comes to our platform to watch sports,” we can generate the following assumptions:

- Desirability: Our subscriber wants to watch sports.
- Desirability: Our subscriber wants to watch sports on our platform.
- Usability: Our subscriber knows they can watch sports on our platform.
- Usability: Our subscriber thinks of our platform when it’s time to watch sports.
- Feasibility: Our platform is available when our subscriber wants to watch sports.

From our second step, “Our platform has live sports options for our subscriber to choose from,” we can generate the following assumptions:

- Desirability: Our platform has the sports our subscriber wants to watch.
- Usability: Our subscriber can find where to go on our platform to find sports.
- Feasibility: We know what sports are available right now.
- Feasibility: We can display what sports are available right now.

From our third step, “Our subscriber chooses a sport that is currently on a local TV channel,” we can generate the following assumptions:

- Desirability: Our subscriber wants to watch a sport that is on a local TV channel.
- Usability: Our subscriber can find the sport they want to watch.
- Usability: Our subscriber knows how to select and play the sport they want to watch.

From our fourth step, “Our local channel provider’s content is available,” we can generate the following assumptions:

- Feasibility: The local provider’s source content will be available.
- Feasibility: We can display the content from our local provider.
- Desirability: The content we display is what the consumer wanted.

From our fourth step, “Our subscriber watches live sports,” we can generate the following assumptions:

- Desirability: The subscriber likes what they chose.
- Feasibility: The stream works well enough for the subscriber to enjoy live sports.
- Usability: The interface doesn’t detract from watching the sport.

Sometimes story maps can help us uncover viability and ethical assumptions as well. For example, this story map might help us realize that we are making the following viability and ethical assumptions:

- Viability: Integrating a local channel feed won’t be too expensive.
- Ethical: Subscribers will be okay with us sharing viewership data with their local channels.

However, you’ll learn more specific techniques for highlighting viability and ethical assumptions in the coming sections.

From a simple 5-step story map, we generated 20 assumptions.

Now if you are feeling overwhelmed, don’t worry. Assumptions aren’t bad. If we’ve done our discovery homework (e.g., continuous interviewing, opportunity mapping, etc.), we’ll understand our customers’ context well, and most of our assumptions will be true enough. You’ll see, later in this chapter, that we won’t even bother testing most of them. However, by taking the time to generate many assumptions, we’ll increase the likelihood that we’ll uncover the risky ones. Later in this chapter, you’ll learn how to prioritize and identify the riskiest assumptions.

Conduct a Pre-Mortem

Story maps aren’t the only way to help us see our own assumptions. Gary Klein, a cognitive psychologist and author of several books on decision-making, flipped the idea of a post-mortem on its head. Post-mortems are after-project reviews where participants assess what went wrong and what could have gone better. Sprint retrospectives are a type of post-mortem. Pre-mortems, on the other hand, happen at the start of the project and are designed to suss out what could go wrong in the future.

Pre-mortems are a great way to generate assumptions. They leverage prospective hindsight—a technique where you imagine what might happen in the future. A pre-mortem encourages you to ask, “Imagine it’s six months in the future; your product or initiative launched, and it was a complete failure. What went wrong?” As you generate reasons for why your product or service might fail, you are exposing assumptions that your idea depends upon that may not be true.

The success of pre-mortems, however, hinges on one key factor—phrasing the question as if the outcome is certain. In our case, that means we have to consider that the product or service did fail, not that it might fail. Deborah Mitchell, Edward Russo, and Nancy Pennington, collaborating psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, and the University of Colorado, found the technique was effective at generating better explanations only when prospective hindsight was paired with a certain outcome.50

Walk the Lines of Your Opportunity Solution Tree

Another way to generate assumptions, particularly viability assumptions, is to use your opportunity solution tree to work backwards from your solution back to your outcome. You can start by generating assumptions using the following starters:

- This solution will address the target opportunity because…
- Addressing the target opportunity will drive the desired outcome because…

Be specific. Why will your solution address the target opportunity? Your answer will contain one or more assumptions that you’ll want to capture. For example, “Adding local channels will allow our subscribers to watch live sports” because “The sports that our subscribers want to watch are on local channels” because “Most of the major sports are on local channels” and “Our subscribers are more likely to want to watch major sports.” Each phrase in quotes is an assumption we can test.

Why does addressing the opportunity “I want to watch live sports” drive the outcome “Increase weekly viewer minutes”? “People will watch sports in addition to what they already watch.” “Even if people cut out other shows, sporting events are long, and their individual viewing sessions will be longer.” “If individual viewing sessions are longer, weekly viewing minutes will go up.”

Now if our desired outcome is a product outcome (as it should be), we might also need to test the assumptions connecting our product outcome to our business outcome to uncover viability assumptions. “People who watch more minutes are more likely to renew.” “The cost of adding local channels will be offset by the gain from more renewals.”

The goal is to capture the logical inferences behind why you think this solution will address your target opportunity in a way that drives your product outcomes and ultimately, your business outcome. Each inference is an assumption that you can test.

Explore Potential Harm

One area that product teams often overlook is ethical assumptions. Now, if you work at a nuclear power plant or on autonomous vehicles, safety is probably a daily conversation. But for the rest of us, it’s an easy factor to forget. To uncover ethical assumptions, I encourage teams to ask, “What’s the potential harm in offering this solution?”

Some teams struggle to come up with anything. But all products have some potential harm. Many products run into ethical dilemmas around their data practices. Here are some questions to ask:

- What data do you plan to collect?
- Do your customers understand that you’ll be collecting that data?
- Do your customers understand how you’ll be using that data?
- Are you planning to share that data with third parties?
- If yes, how are those third parties planning to use that data?
- If your customers fully understood how you planned to use their data, would they be okay with it?

But ethical assumptions aren’t limited to how we use data. We might ask:

- Does our product have the potential to become addictive? Many product teams consider this a good thing. But is it good for your end-user?
- Are there people who are being left out? Are you designing for one demographic and leaving out an under-represented population?
- Are you assuming that your end-users have money, free time, a roof over their head, access to the internet? If so, who does this leave out? What are the implications of that?
- Does this solution contribute to society’s inequalities? Or does it help to mitigate the inequalities?
- Are we exposing someone’s identity who might need anonymity for their own safety?
- Is there a potential to harm relationships between our end-users?
- How might Internet trolls abuse this?51

Some solutions can cause harm to our business. We might consider:

- Will this solution help or hurt our brand?
- Can we meet customers’ expectations, or will we leave them disappointed?
- Are we spending time building the wrong stuff, therefore losing out on more compelling opportunities?

One of my favorite questions to ask teams is, “If the New York Times/Wall Street Journal/BBC (or insert your favorite news organization) ran a front-page story about this solution that included your internal conversations about how the solution would work, what data you collected, how you used it, and how different players in the ecosystem benefited or didn’t, would that be a good thing? If not, why not?” This is a great way to uncover ethical assumptions.

Mix and Match the Methods

Whenever I reconnect with teams that I’ve coached in the past, I always like to ask them about their discovery process. Many are embarrassed to say they are no longer story mapping or they no longer walk the lines of their opportunity solution tree. When I ask, “How come?” they always explain they are getting so good at seeing their own assumptions that they don’t need to do these steps anymore. There’s nothing wrong with that. All of the habits in this book are designed to get you to a specific outcome. This chapter is about helping you become aware of the assumptions you are making and encourages you to explicitly enumerate them.

If you have no idea how to do that, story mapping, pre-mortems, walking the lines of your opportunity solution tree, and questioning potential harm will help you start to see your own assumptions. However, as you exercise this muscle, these methods may become less necessary. That’s not a bad thing. That means you are developing your skills around questioning your assumptions.

You don’t need to use every method for every idea every time. If you are struggling to enumerate viability assumptions, walk the lines of your opportunity solution tree. If you are great at identifying feasibility assumptions but often forget about desirability assumptions, take some time to story map the idea. Use the methods that shore up your weak spots.

In my experience, most teams have a bias toward one category or another. They are great at testing usability but forget about desirability. Or they always remember desirability and usability, but they forget viability. Most product teams have a blind spot for ethical assumptions. Our intentions are good, so we forget that our product has potential harm. Use the methods that help you address your team’s specific blind spots.

Prioritizing Assumptions

Armed with a long list of assumptions for each idea, it’s now time to assess and prioritize which assumptions need further testing. Assumption mapping, an exercise designed by David J. Bland, author of Testing Business Ideas, is a great way to quickly identify what Bland calls your “leap of faith” assumptions—the assumptions that carry the most risk and thus need to be tested.

With assumption mapping, you’ll be quickly evaluating each assumption on two dimensions. I recommend you start with assessing “How much do we know about this assumption?” In other words, what evidence do we already have that tells us this assumption is true or false? If we have a lot of evidence that it’s true, then we would place the assumption on the left side of the x-axis. If we have very little evidence, we would place it on the right side of the x-axis.

Next, we want to assess how important this assumption is to the success of your idea. Now, all assumptions are important to the success of your idea as currently designed. However, some assumptions can be easily worked around if they turn out not to be true. Others may be much harder to work around. These would make these assumptions more important. The more important an assumption is, the higher on the y-axis it gets placed. The less important it is, the lower on the y-axis it gets placed.

Each assumption lives in one spot on the two-dimensional grid. You want to find the moment in space that represents how important an assumption is to the success of the idea and how much evidence we have or don’t have to support it. However, this exercise does not need to be precise. You are mapping assumptions relative to each other. For example, once you place the first assumption, for the second assumption, you can now ask, “Do we have stronger or weaker evidence for this assumption as compared to the first assumption, and is this assumption more or less important than the first assumption?” and place it relative to the first assumption.

In my experience running this exercise in workshops and with the teams that I coach, teams do just as well when they do this exercise fast (i.e., no more than ten minutes per idea) as when they deliberate and discuss every placement. So, save yourself some time, and go fast.

Additionally, some teams have a bias toward everything being important and having weak evidence. That’s okay. All of your assumptions have some degree of both. Whether your assumptions are all jammed in the upper-right corner or are spread across all four quadrants, it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that your assumptions are positioned relative to each other.

Once we’ve completed our mapping, we are going to start by testing the assumptions in the top-most, right-most corner. Bear in mind, this does not mean you are testing all of the assumptions in the top-right quadrant. We often don’t have time for that. It means you are starting with the two or three assumptions that fall in the upper-right corner. Those are your most important assumptions with the weakest evidence—the assumptions that Bland calls your “leap of faith” assumptions.

You’ll want to story map, generate assumptions, and assumption map for each of your three ideas. In the next chapter, we’ll learn how to quickly test your “leap of faith” assumptions for each of your ideas so that you are able to compare and contrast the ideas against each other.

Avoid These Common Anti-Patterns

As you work to identify the hidden assumptions behind your ideas, be sure to avoid these common anti-patterns:

Not generating enough assumptions. Generating assumptions, like ideating, is intended to be a divergent exercise. The goal is to identify as many “gotchas” as you can to increase the chance that you generate the riskiest ones. However, many teams dramatically underestimate how many assumptions underlie their ideas. When I do these exercises, I often generate 20–30 assumptions for even a simple idea. If that sounds overwhelming, remember, you won’t need to test all of these assumptions. Most of them will be harmless. You’ll use the assumption-mapping exercise to quickly find the riskiest ones. However, if you don’t generate the riskiest assumptions, the mapping exercise won’t help you sort something that you haven’t uncovered. Use the five assumption categories and the exercises in this chapter to help you generate as many assumptions as you can.

Phrasing your assumptions such that you need them to be false. Generating assumptions can be a bit of a devil’s-advocate exercise. You are looking for what might go wrong with your ideas. As a result, you might be tempted to phrase your assumptions negatively. For example, if you need your users to log in to your service, you might phrase your assumption as, “Customers won’t remember their password.” However, this is backwards. You need customers to remember their password for your idea to work. When you are generating assumptions, always phrase your assumptions such that you need them to be true: “Customers will remember their passwords.” For many assumptions, you’ll find that this positive framing will make them easier to test.

Not being specific enough. I see many teams generate assumptions like this: “Customers will have time,” “Customers will know what to do,” and “Our engineers can build something like this.” These assumptions are not specific enough to test. What will customers have time for? What do you need them to know how to do? What do engineers need to build? Be specific. These assumptions are much better: “Customers will take the time to browse all the options on our getting-started page,” “Customers will know how to select the right option based on their situation,” and “Our engineers can identify the right subset of options to show the customer based on the customer’s profile data.”

Favoring one category at the cost of other categories. Most teams have a bias toward one or two categories at the cost of the other categories. Some teams conflate desirability and usability and forget that just because a product is usable doesn’t mean it’s desirable. For products with challenging feasibility issues, it can be hard to remember to first test and see if customers even want the solution. Most teams forget about ethical assumptions altogether. Remember: Use the categories to catch your blind spots.
