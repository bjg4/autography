CHAPTER THIRTEEN

SHOW YOUR WORK

“The more leaders can understand where teams are, the more they will step back and let teams execute.”

— Melissa Perri, Escaping the Build Trap

Lisa Orr, a product manager at Airship, and her team were tasked with solving a recurring problem for their sales team. In conversation after conversation, prospects kept asking for a customer-journey-builder feature that Airship didn’t have. The simple solution would have been to build what their competitors offered. But Lisa and her team knew better. They were right in the middle of my 12-week coaching program and had learned that what customers ask for isn’t always what they need. They didn’t want to spend time, money, and energy building the wrong feature, so instead, they turned to their discovery habits to help them out.

Airship started as a mobile push-notification company and quickly expanded to a broader set of marketing-automation tools. They help their customers send the right message to the right user at the right time on the right channel. Odds are, if you’ve received a push notification from AccuWeather about severe weather alerts, a mobile boarding pass from Alaska Airlines, or a text message from Boston Market about Rotisserie Rewards, it was delivered by Airship. Airship operates in a crowded marketplace, and, as marketing automation has matured and evolved, Airship, like most players in this space, has had to hustle to keep up.

When Lisa’s team was asked to build a customer-journey builder to help Airship win deals against competitors who offered this feature, they knew they had a lot to learn. They started by interviewing their own customers who also used a competitor’s journey builder. A journey builder allows a marketer to sequence marketing messages over time and across channels. For example, a retailer might design a post-purchase journey that starts with sending a purchase receipt by email. A few days later, the customer might receive a coupon via a push notification incentivizing them to return to the store. And upon entering the store, the customer might receive a text message reminding them to use their coupon.

In conversations with customers, Lisa’s team quickly realized existing customer-journey builders weren’t very good. They were so complex that many marketers didn’t know how to get started. The customers who did ended up creating complicated journeys that were redundant and hard to maintain. It quickly became clear that building what the competitors offered wasn’t going to be good enough. Lisa’s team also realized that this was a huge opportunity to differentiate their offering from the competitors’.

Lisa’s team interviewed customers, mapped out the opportunity space, explored multiple solutions, quickly prototyped to test their assumptions, and landed on a solution that they were excited about. However, when they shared their progress with the rest of the company, they ran into a significant roadblock. The sales team pushed back. They didn’t want to sell something new. They wanted to give their prospects what they were asking for—a journey builder just like what the competition offered.

Thankfully, this story has a happy ending. Lisa and her team were able to convince their leadership to allow them to run a one-month beta launch with a limited set of customers to test out their new feature. They were confident, from having done good discovery, that, if they could just get customers using the feature, the sales team would be convinced. It turns out they were, and, after a successful beta release, the Airship Journeys product launched and has seen great success.

What I want to highlight here is that, while Lisa’s team did a great job executing on their discovery and were able to bring a successful product to market, all that work would have gone to waste if they weren’t able to get their sales team (and other business stakeholders) on board. This is a common tale and one that most product trios can learn from. It’s not enough to do good discovery if you aren’t bringing your stakeholders along with you. This chapter will show you how to use the same visual artifacts you learned throughout this book to help you manage and bring stakeholders along, so that, when you land on a better solution, the organization is ready and eager to adopt it.

Don’t Jump Straight to Your Conclusions

When preparing for a meeting with stakeholders, we tend to focus on our conclusions—our roadmap, our release plan, our prioritized backlog. More often than not, this is exactly what our stakeholders are asking us to share. Even in companies that espouse a focus on outcomes, we still tend to spend most of our time talking about outputs.

The challenge with this approach is that our stakeholders often have their own conclusions. It’s easy to have an opinion about outputs. We all have our own preferences about how a product or service should work. When we anchor the conversation in the solution space, we encourage our stakeholders to share their own preferences. However, these preferences aren’t always grounded in good discovery. After all, it’s our job to do discovery, not our stakeholders’.

When you frame the conversation in the solution space, you are framing the conversation to be about your opinion about what to build versus your stakeholders’ opinion about what to build. If your stakeholders are more senior to you, odds are their opinion is going to win. This is why we have the dreaded HiPPO acronym (the Highest Paid Person’s Opinions) and the saying “The HiPPO always wins.” Many product trios complain about the HiPPO but miss the role they play in creating this situation.

When we present our conclusions, we aren’t sharing the journey we took to reach those conclusions. Instead, we are inviting our stakeholders to an opinion battle—a battle we have no chance of winning.

Slow Down and Show Your Work

When meeting with stakeholders, don’t start with your conclusions. Instead, slow down and show your work. Throughout this book, you’ve learned to use an opportunity solution tree to help you chart the best path to your desired outcome. This same visual can help you share your work with your stakeholders. Just like it’s easy for us to get distracted by shiny new ideas, it’s also easy for our stakeholders to get distracted. It’s our job to set the context for how product decisions are made. Your opportunity solution tree helps you do exactly that. And just like it helped you and your team build confidence in your decisions, it will do the same for your stakeholders.

When meeting with stakeholders, start at the top of your tree. Remind your stakeholders what your desired outcome is. Ask them if anything has changed since you last agreed to this outcome. This sets the scope for the conversation.

Share how you mapped out the opportunity space. Highlight the top-level opportunities. Drill into the detail only when and where they ask for it. Ask them if you missed anything. Consider that they may have knowledge of opportunities that you might have missed. Capture their suggestions. You can always vet them in your future customer interviews.

Share how you assessed and prioritized the opportunity space. Use the tree structure to walk through each decision you made. Choose the appropriate level of detail based on the stakeholder you are talking to. Ask them if they would have made a different decision at each decision point. Consider their feedback.

Share more context about your target opportunity. Help them fully understand the customer need or pain point you intend to address. Use your interview snapshots to help your stakeholders empathize with your customers. Answer their questions. This step is critical. Your stakeholder needs to fully understand the opportunity you are pursuing before you share solutions with them. This is what sets the context for how to evaluate solutions and moves the conversation away from opinions and preferences.

Share the solutions you generated. Ask them if they have any of their own ideas. Make sure you capture and consider them. Share the set of three solutions you plan to move forward with. Ask them if they would have chosen a different set. Stay open-minded. You may have invested time and energy into your solution set, but remember: Solution ideas are a dime a dozen. The key criteria for your first solution set is diversity. Your stakeholders can often help you generate more diverse ideas than what your team can do on their own. If that’s the case, don’t be afraid to swap in some of their ideas.

If you’ve already started assumption testing, share your story maps and your assumption lists. Make sure your stakeholders fully understand how each solution might work. Remember, this is where opinions and preferences might pop up again. Gently remind your stakeholders what your target opportunity is. Ask your stakeholders to add to your assumption lists. This is where their unique knowledge and expertise can be invaluable for helping us catch our own blind spots.

Share your assumption map. Be sure to add any of the assumptions that your stakeholders identified. Ask them if they would have prioritized the assumptions differently. Make adjustments as needed.

Share your assumption tests. If you have data, share the data. Otherwise, share your execution plans. Ask for feedback. Consider and integrate their feedback.

Repeat.

When we show our work, we are inviting our stakeholders to co-create with us. Instead of sharing our conclusions and inviting them to share their preferences, we are sharing our work and inviting them to assess our thinking and to add their own. We are leveraging their expertise and improving our process.

Finally, I described this process as a one-time event. But a good product trio knows to continuously manage stakeholders. Share your work along the way, rather than all at the end. Be thoughtful about when and how to share your work. Some stakeholders will want all the details week over week; others might want the highlights monthly. Adapt to what your stakeholders need. But even if they ask for outputs, take the time to show the work that helped you conclude those were the right outputs.

Generate and Evaluate Options

When we take the time to show our work, using visual artifacts like experience maps, opportunity solution trees, and story maps, we are inviting our stakeholders along for the journey with us. Instead of presenting our conclusion—this is the roadmap, release plan, and backlog that will help us reach our desired outcome—we are presenting the potential paths we might take to get there. We are inviting our stakeholders to help us choose the right path. Instead of presenting a conclusion, we are generating and evaluating options. This allows our stakeholders to be a part of the process. We are inviting them to co-create with us, which leads to much more buy-in and long-term success.

Common Anti-Patterns

As you work with your stakeholders, keep these common anti-patterns in mind.

Telling instead of showing. Even though we all know that showing is better than telling, all too often, we fall into the trap of telling instead of showing. We are proud of our work. We are excited about our conclusions. We love our ideas, so, of course, our stakeholders will love our ideas, too. We rush into telling our stakeholders everything we’ve learned instead of showing our stakeholders so that they can draw their own conclusions.

There’s a cognitive bias that is coming into play when we do this. It’s called the curse of knowledge.55 Once we know something (like we do in this situation, we have a wealth of discovery work that supports our point of view), it’s hard for us to remember what it was like not to have that knowledge. In fact, our conclusions—our roadmaps, our backlogs, our release plans—start to become obvious. We forget that not only are they not obvious to our stakeholders but also that they very likely have their own conclusions that seem obvious to them. The key to avoiding this “curse of knowledge” is to slow down. Start at the beginning. Walk your stakeholder through what you learned and what decisions you made. Give them space to follow your logic, and, most importantly, give them time to reach the same conclusion.

Overwhelming stakeholders with all the messy details. Even though we want to slow down and show our work, we don’t want to overwhelm our stakeholders with every last detail of what we’ve learned. If you are interviewing customers and running several assumption tests every week, everything you are learning will quickly overwhelm a busy stakeholder.

Instead, you need to act as a smart filter. Tailor the detail and context to the stakeholder you are talking to. What does this stakeholder, in particular, need to know? Your boss might enjoy the discovery journey and want week-over-week updates of how things are going. Your marketing manager probably doesn’t want that much detail. Instead, monthly updates with just the highlights might be adequate. Your CEO probably needs even less detail.

However, when someone wants less detail, it doesn’t mean you aren’t showing your work. Even with a busy CEO, you still want to start with the outcome you are driving, highlight the top two or three opportunities, give a quick explanation of why you chose the one you did, highlight your top solutions, and share the results of one or two assumption tests that support your final decision. For example, Lisa’s team might share the following narrative: “Our goal is to reduce the number of lost sales from not having a journey builder (outcome). We interviewed customers and learned that existing journey builders are too complex; marketers don’t know how to get started (opportunity one), and, when they do, their journeys are hard to maintain (opportunity two), and they often create redundant journeys (opportunity three). We decided to focus on reducing the complexity by helping marketers to zoom out from the messages they are sending to focus on the goals they are trying to achieve. We explored a few different ways to do this, but the most promising one is our lifecycle-maps idea. In testing, we found that marketers had no problem getting started and that they loved the high-level view on their work.”

Of course, Lisa’s team discovered dozens of opportunities, and their solutions addressed many of them. But their CEO doesn’t need all of this detail. He needs to know that Lisa’s team is finding a solution that customers love that drives the outcome he cares about.

Arguing with stakeholders about why their ideas won’t work. As you do more and more assumption tests, assumptions become building blocks. You start to learn which building blocks will work and which won’t. When you hear a new idea, you are going to be able to quickly assess it based on those building blocks. However, when working with stakeholders, we need to remember that they aren’t starting from the same set of building blocks. The fastest way to discourage your stakeholders is to shoot down their ideas. Remember, nobody likes the know-it-all.

Instead of jumping straight to why an idea won’t work, use your discovery framework to help the stakeholder see where their idea does fit. For example, is the stakeholder focused on a different outcome from you? If yes, then don’t shoot down their idea. Even if you don’t like the idea (remember, our preferences don’t matter), you can remind your stakeholder that, while their idea might be a good fit for their outcome, it doesn’t support your outcome right now. You can follow this same strategy if their solution addresses a different opportunity. You can always say something like, “That idea has promise. We’ll consider it when we address that opportunity.” You can even capture it on your tree or in your idea backlog (not your development backlog) so that you remember to return to it later.

If your stakeholder is suggesting a solution for your target opportunity, consider it. Should it be in your consideration set? If you can see that it is based on a faulty assumption, don’t just call that out. Help your stakeholder reach that conclusion on their own. You can do this by story mapping their idea together. Generate assumptions together. When your stakeholder sees what assumptions their idea is based upon, you can now share what you’ve learned about those assumptions in your past assumption tests. This helps your stakeholder reach their own conclusions about their own ideas.

Trying to win the ideological battle instead of focusing on the decision at hand. No matter how strong your discovery process is, there will still be times when your stakeholders swoop in and ask you to do things their way. If they are more senior to you in the corporate hierarchy, that’s their prerogative. What you can control is how you respond. I strongly recommend that you don’t turn the conversation into an ideological battle. In fact, if you ever catch yourself saying, “This is the way it’s supposed to be done,” take a deep breath, and walk away from the conversation. You aren’t going to win the ideological war in one conversation.

Instead, you need to take stock of the decision that needs to be made and focus on the best outcome given what you have to work with. Save the ideological war for later (or never). You aren’t going to convince your stakeholder that their worldview is wrong. In fact, this is tied to the “Show, don’t tell” advice above. When you are asked to deviate from your discovery process, telling your stakeholders that they are doing it wrong isn’t going to get you anywhere. Focus on the opportunities with which you can show the benefit of working this way. Choose your battles. Don’t fight the ones you can’t win.
