CHAPTER FOURTEEN

START SMALL, AND ITERATE

“This all sounds great, but my company doesn’t work this way.”

— You, the reader

I was 22 years old. I had just graduated from college and was starting my first full-time job as an application software developer at HighWire Press, a division of the Stanford University Libraries and a pioneer in bringing STEM journals online. I was hired as a designer and front-end engineer working on several online communities for academic researchers. Our goal was to bring researchers from across disciplines (think biology, chemistry, medicine) who were working on the same types of problems together in a collaborative online space. We were working on innovative features like virtual folders to replace physical filing cabinets that stored decades of journal articles and message boards where researchers could discuss said journal articles. This was 1999, and the World Wide Web was the new frontier.

As a college student, I was introduced to human-centered design and was excited to put what I learned into practice on the job. I remember my first design assignment like it was yesterday. Our client, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) was our collaborating partner on our first online community, and they had a long list of feature requests. My job was to design site navigation that encompassed all of those features. I spent a grand total of three days playing with different ideas and then walked into my first-ever client meeting.

I presented my designs, confident in my work (after all, my manager liked it), and waited for the accolades to roll in. That’s when someone on the client side said, “This is horrible.” It was a sucker punch. She continued, “This isn’t what we want at all. Why can’t you just do it like this?” At which point, she proceeded to describe what (unbeknown to me) she had asked for a few weeks prior before I joined the company. That’s when I realized: I had no idea who our client was, what they wanted, or who their end-user was. What in the world was I doing throwing designs over the wall? So much for that high-priced, human-centered design education.

Actually, what that education gave me was the ability to bounce back. I knew that, while my boss (and the rest of the company) operated by throwing designs over the wall, it didn’t mean I had to. I got to choose how I did my own work, and I knew if I was going to be good at design, I needed to keep the client and the end-user close. I started right then and there on that call. I invited the woman who was unhappy with my design to partner with me on the next iteration. We scheduled a phone call (this was before the days of Zoom) and agreed to work together.

From there, when I was asked to do design work, I joined the client meetings from the beginning of the project. I got involved at the contracting stage. I listened in when the client described what they wanted. I asked to attend their conferences. I spent time talking to the journal editors. I read the discussion forums in our product to learn more about end-users’ research. I mined our feedback channels, looking for needs and pain points. I built feedback loops directly into the product. I didn’t know how to get direct access to our end-users, so I looked for every proxy I could find.

This didn’t happen overnight. I was 22. I had no idea what I was doing. I simply had a guiding principle: If I’m going to do good design work, I need to get close to my customer. That guiding principle stayed with me as I went on to work at early-stage startups; it’s guided me as I started my own business, and it’s helped me develop the coaching curriculum that this book is based on.

So why am I telling you this story? If you are reading this book and feel like these methods won’t work at your company, here’s what I’ll tell you: I rarely had the support of senior leadership to do product discovery well. I worked at HighWire Press, where we let our clients dictate what we built for end-users. I worked at a startup where our Vice President of Product thought his job was to manage a spreadsheet of feature requests that came from the CEO. I worked at another startup where customers submitted requests and we built them. Trust me, I know what it’s like to work at places that don’t do modern product discovery.

However, in every single one of these jobs, I found a way to get close to the customer. I found a way to advocate for human-centered design. I found a way to build products that worked for our customers—and it wasn’t that hard. Here’s how I did it: I had a strong sense of agency.

I knew that I could impact how I did my own work. I didn’t worry about what other people were doing. I didn’t try to change the way these companies worked. I simply did my work my way, and I got results—so much so that, by the age of 32, I was the CEO of someone else’s company. I don’t share that to brag; I share that to show that you have more agency than you think you do.

Instead of asking for permission or waiting for someone to show you how, start small. Iterate from there. I made a career doing that, and I’ve coached hundreds of others to do the same. This chapter will help you get started on your own continuous-discovery journey, regardless of where your company is in its own transformation.

Build Your Trio

Don’t work alone. The habits in this book are designed to be adopted by a cross-functional trio. Even if your team isn’t fully resourced or your company culture doesn’t support the trio model, you can start building these relationships yourself. If you are a product manager, find a designer and an engineer to partner with. Consult them on key decisions. Work together to decide what to build.

If your teammates change from project to project, your trio may change with it. That’s okay.

If the first person you ask isn’t interested, find someone who is. Start small with your ask. Instead of asking them to partner with you on all of your discovery decisions, ask them to weigh in on one small decision. Iterate from there.

If your company doesn’t hire designers, find someone who is design-minded. Every company has people who naturally think from a usability perspective. Look for people who are good at simplifying complex concepts, have firsthand experience with your customers, and have an abundance of empathy for your customers’ challenges.

Your guiding principle is simple: How can I include all three disciplines in as many discovery decisions as I can? Make next week look better than last week. Repeat.

Once you have your trio in place, you are ready to adopt the keystone habit of continuous discovery.

Start Talking to Customers

If you aren’t familiar with the concept of a keystone habit, it comes from Charles Duhigg’s book The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business. Duhigg argues, “Keystone habits start a process that, over time, transforms everything.” They are habits that, once adopted, drive the adoption of other habits.

For most people, exercise is a keystone habit. When we exercise regularly, we naturally tend to eat better, we have more energy, and thus we are more productive at work. For others, making your bed each morning is a keystone habit. It sets the tone of rigor and discipline from the start of your day. This is why many military leaders advocate for this habit.

To be clear, it’s not that exercise makes you eat better or making your bed makes you more disciplined, but doing the former makes the latter easier. The keystone habit builds motivation for the subsequent habits.

I’ve noticed this exact pattern emerge among product teams who develop a weekly habit of customer interviews. When product teams engage with their customers week over week, they don’t just get the benefit of interviewing more often—they also start rapid prototyping and experimenting more often. They remember to doubt what they know and to test their assumptions. They do a better job of connecting what they are learning from their research activities with the product decisions they are making. This is why a weekly touchpoint with customers is a key part of the definition of continuous discovery that you were introduced to in Chapter 1.

I believe continuous interviewing is a keystone habit for continuous discovery. Of all the habits in this book, if you are looking for one place to get started, this is it.

If you’re wondering how you’re going to make this happen, I hear you. I’ve worked with dozens of teams who have genuinely struggled to find customers to talk to. They aren’t allowed to build recruiting hooks into the product. Their sales and account-management teams want to own the relationship and be the go-between, rather than let product people have direct access. Their customers are busy doctors or secretive investors or high-powered CEOs. I can’t tell you how to overcome all of these obstacles. I know from working with many teams that every situation is unique.

But I can tell you that there is a way. Even in the most challenging situations, the teams I’ve worked with have chipped away at getting more access to their customers. They’ve taken a continuous-improvement approach to the challenge. If they have never talked to a customer, they start small and try to find a single customer to talk to. If they can’t do even that, they start by talking with someone who is similar to their customers. They use each conversation to get introduced to another person to talk to. They make next week look better than last week. And with time, they find themselves on a path to continuous interviewing.

No matter your situation, this is the habit to start with.

Work Backward

Many product teams aren’t allowed to do discovery. They still work in a feature-team or delivery-team model, where business stakeholders tell them what to build. If this is you, don’t worry—there is hope. Remember, I worked this way for years. You can still work on developing continuous discovery habits yourself.

When you are asked to deliver a specific solution, work backward. Take the time to consider, “If our customers had this solution, what would it do for them?” If you are talking to customers regularly, ask them. Try to uncover the implied opportunity. Even if it’s a wild guess, starting to consider customer needs, pain points, and desires will help you deliver a better solution.

You can apply the same question to your business to uncover the implied outcome, “If we shipped this feature, what value would it create for our business?” Refine your answer until you get to a clear metric—that’s your outcome. By the way, by asking those two questions, you’ve also built your first opportunity solution tree.

As you work on requirements for the solutions you were asked to build, remember to story map your ideas. Use your story maps to identify hidden assumptions. Even if you don’t have the infrastructure to quickly prototype or test your assumptions, being aware of your assumptions will help you notice the evidence around you that either supports or refutes them. When you uncover a faulty assumption, work with your stakeholders to evolve the idea. Better yet, when a stakeholder brings a solution to you, story map and identify assumptions with them. The idea will improve right then and there.

Work with your stakeholders to identify the impact they expect a given feature to have. Document that conversation. As you implement the feature, be sure to instrument what you need to measure against the expected impact. Start doing post-release impact reviews with your stakeholders. Remind them what impact they expected a feature to have. Share with them the impact the feature actually had. If it falls short, as it inevitably will, share the implied opportunity you uncovered by asking, “Are we trying to solve this customer problem with this feature?” If your stakeholder agrees, ask if you can consider alternative solutions to that same customer need. Or better yet, ideate with your stakeholders. Congratulations! You just built out the first mini-branch of your opportunity solution tree.

The best time to advocate for discovery is when a feature falls short of expectations. You can gently suggest ways that you could have discovered the gap earlier in the process. This is a great time to share what you are learning in your interviews. But be careful. You don’t want to come across as a know-it-all or have an “I told you so” attitude. Instead, approach the situation as a collaborative problem solver. Work with your stakeholders to evolve your processes. If they push back, let up. Remember, you don’t have to worry about how other people work. You can make great strides yourself, focusing on how you work. But you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how receptive folks are to small changes when things don’t go as expected. Read the room, and adjust your suggestions accordingly.

Use Your Retrospectives to Reflect and Improve

Meet regularly as a trio to reflect on your discovery process. If you already do Scrum retrospectives, it’s easy to add a couple of reflective questions to this meeting to also reflect on your discovery process.

I encourage my teams to ask, “What did we learn during this sprint that surprised us?” This could be anything from a feature release didn’t have the expected impact, we learned a new insight in a customer interview, or we ran into a feasibility hurdle that required us to redesign a solution. Make a list.

Then, for each item on the list, ask, “How could we have learned that sooner?” The answers to these questions will help you improve your discovery process. If a release didn’t have the intended impact, was there a faulty assumption that you neglected to uncover? Did it not get prioritized as one of your “leap of faith” assumptions for testing? If you learned a new insight during a customer interview, was it because you misunderstood a customer need, or did you uncover a new part of the customer experience for the first time? If you ran into a feasibility hurdle, is it because the requirements were misunderstood (maybe you need to revisit your story maps)? Or perhaps feasibility assumptions are a bit of a blind spot for your team.

As you conduct this retrospective, be nice to yourselves. Remember, no matter how good you get at discovery, you’ll still run into surprises. Surprises help us improve. Take the time to learn from them.

Avoid These Common Anti-Patterns

As you work to adopt the continuous discovery habits, be sure to avoid these common anti-patterns.

Focusing on why a given strategy won’t work (AKA “That will never work here”), instead of focusing on what is within your control. After every conference or meetup talk, participants always ask a question that falls into the form of, “That would never work at my company.” It’s easy to hear or read about what other companies do and think their tactics won’t work at your company. It’s true that every organization is unique. However, I’ve worked with teams in a variety of industries (from banking to healthcare to retail to marketing automation to security), at companies of all sizes (from two founders just getting started to global companies with hundreds of thousands of employees), on all types of products and services. The habits in this book have been adopted and worked at all of them. Do they need to be adapted to the unique organizational context? Absolutely! But in every instance, we were able to look at what each team could do, given the context in which they worked, and we found a way. So, I encourage you to consider what you can do and let go of the “That would never work here” mentality that is so easy to fall into.

Being the annoying champion for the “right way” of working. Some people, instead of adopting a “That will never work here” mindset, swing the pendulum too far in the other direction. They want to work using the “one right way” to do discovery. I have news for you. There is no “one right way” to do discovery. All of the habits in this book can and should be adopted to match your team’s preferences and needs. This book isn’t designed to be recipes that should be followed to the T, but rather templates that should help you get started. Once you have a handle on how they work, you can and should adopt them to better meet your own needs. Especially when you’re new to adopting continuous discovery habits, don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. Instead, adopt a continuous-improvement mindset. If next week looks better than last week, you are on the right track.

Waiting for permission instead of starting with what is within your control. I’ve met dozens of teams who have never talked to customers because they believe they aren’t allowed to. However, they regularly engage with customers outside of work. They work for a major bank, and most (if not all) of their friends have a bank account. They build sales software, and their best friend’s dad works in sales. They work on hospital badge systems, and they have three clinicians in their extended family. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. Get started by talking to anyone who is like your customers. Iterate from there.
