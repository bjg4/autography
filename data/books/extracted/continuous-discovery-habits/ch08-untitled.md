- Shift from an output mindset to an outcome mindset (Chapter 3).
- Frame, refine, and prioritize the opportunity space (Chapters 4–7).
- Generate and evaluate targeted solutions (Chapters 8–10).
- Measure the impact of your work all the way through to delivery so that delivery fuels discovery (Chapter 11).
- Manage the messy cycles of discovery, keeping you on track, even when you learn something surprising (Chapter 12).
- Show your work, bringing your stakeholders along throughout the discovery process (Chapter 13).
