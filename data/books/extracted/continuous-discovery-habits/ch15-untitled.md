DISCOVERING SOLUTIONS

In this section, we’ll explore how to generate, evaluate, and iterate on the solutions that will help you create customer value and business value. You’ll learn how to:

- Ideate effectively so that you can embrace a “compare and contrast” mindset and work with sets of solutions rather than fixating on your favorite solution (Chapter 8).
- Identify the hidden assumptions that are lurking behind each of your ideas, helping you catch blind spots before they can negatively impact your solutions (Chapter 9).
- Test assumptions in a way that helps you quickly throw out what’s not working and iterate on what is (Chapter 10).
