CHAPTER FIVE

CONTINUOUS INTERVIEWING

Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!’” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

— Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, in Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs

“Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it. It is wise to take admissions of uncertainty seriously, but declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.”

— Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow

Steve Jobs, the founder and former CEO of Apple, often discounted market research. He argued, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” Jobs was right. Customers don’t always know what they want. Most aren’t well-versed in technology. Nor do they have time to dream up what’s possible. That’s our job. That’s what Jobs meant when he said, “Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.” We are the inventors, not our customers.

However, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be talking to our customers. In this chapter, you will learn why interviewing on a regular cadence is critical to the success of any product trio and how to build a habit of interviewing weekly.

The purpose of customer interviewing is not to ask your customers what you should build. Instead, the purpose of an interview is to discover and explore opportunities. Remember, opportunities are customer needs, pain points, and desires. They are opportunities to intervene in your customers’ lives in a positive way.

Steve Jobs knew the importance of discovering opportunities better than most. He and the rest of the Apple team were masters at uncovering unmet needs. When the first iPhone was released in 2007, it wasn’t the first smartphone on the market. People resisted the idea of an on-screen keyboard. There were no third-party apps. But even though Apple wasn’t first to the market and they launched with a limited feature set, the first iPhone solved several customer needs that other smartphones didn’t.

If you are too young to remember the first iPhone, one of the big features at release was visual voicemail. Visual voicemail is so familiar today, it’s hard to remember what voicemail used to be like. Here’s how Ars Technica described visual voicemail in their 2007 review:

Instead of requiring the user to dial up the carrier’s voicemail number and listen to his or her voicemails in the order that they were received, visual voicemail lists each message out in visual format on the iPhone, almost like e-mail. It displays who the voicemail is from (and if it doesn’t recognize the number, it will analyze the area code and tell you what geographical area it’s from, which is helpful), and the user can tap whichever one in the list that he or she wants, no matter its position in the list. When the voicemail is playing, the user can pause it, scrub back and forth in the message, or skip.21

Now, if you had interviewed customers before the original iPhone was released, nobody would have asked for visual voicemail. Nobody knew visual voicemail was possible. Most people weren’t even aware of their own pain points and challenges with how regular voicemail worked. Voicemail wasn’t important enough for us to give it any thought.

Voicemail, at the time, was a minor inconvenience. To gain access to your voicemail, you dialed your own phone number, entered a password, and listened to each message sequentially. One by one, you had to decide if you wanted to replay a message, keep it, or delete it. If you had five messages and you needed to hear the third message, you had to decide what to do with the first two messages before you could get to the third one.

Voicemail was tedious. We were so accustomed to the tedium that we no longer noticed it. In fact, voicemail was a vast improvement over an earlier technology—tape-recorded answering machines. Early answering machines required that you be at home to check your messages. If you wanted to skip a message, you had to manually fast-forward and hope that you stopped in the right spot to hear the next message.

Voicemail, on the other hand, allowed you to check your messages from anywhere. You could quickly skip from one message to the next. Jobs and his team, however, weren’t satisfied. While voicemail was better than early answering machines, it still presented pain points and challenges for the end-user. Apple uncovered these opportunities and addressed them. Visual voicemail delighted consumers.

Apple is secretive about the way they work, so it’s not clear if they interviewed users, observed friends and family, or simply identified these opportunities based on their own experience. But what is clear is that Apple is better than most at discovering opportunities.

For the rest of us, this chapter will cover how to use continuous interviewing to reliably find customer opportunities. As we saw with visual voicemail, we can’t always rely on our customers to tell us what they need or want. Instead, you’ll learn how to use your customers’ own stories to discover their unmet needs.

The Challenges With Asking People What They Need

During a workshop, I asked a woman what factors she considered when buying a new pair of jeans. She didn’t hesitate to answer. She said, “Fit is my number-one factor.” I then asked her to tell me about the last time she bought a pair of jeans. She said, “I bought them on Amazon.” I asked, “How did you know they would fit?” She replied, “I didn’t, but they were a brand I liked, and they were on sale.”

What’s the difference between her two responses? Her first response tells me how she thinks she buys a pair of jeans. Her second response tells me how she actually bought a pair of jeans. This is a crucial difference. She thinks she buys a pair of jeans based on fit, but brand loyalty, the convenience of online shopping, and price (or getting a good deal) were more important when it came time to make a purchase.

This story isn’t unique. I’ve asked people these same two questions countless times in workshops. The purchasing factors often vary, but there is always a gap between the first answer and the second. These participants aren’t lying. We just aren’t very good at understanding our own behavior.

Decades of research on investigative interviewing (the kind used by journalists, lawyers, and detectives) has shown that interview participants struggle to answer direct (factual) questions accurately.22 In a witness interview, this might mean that the participant mistakes the color of the getaway car or forgets an important location. In a customer interview, this might mean that the customer misremembers when they bought something or forgets why they signed up for a particular service.

Direct questions require that we recall facts without context. This process is prone to cognitive biases—common patterns in mental errors that result from the way our brains process information.23 We are bad at quantifying how often we do something. We often speculate about what we did, when, and why. We tend to favor generalities over specifics. We give answers that are influenced more by our sense of identity rather than our actual behavior. And we tend to come up with coherent reasons to explain our behavior that are often not grounded in reality. To be clear, this behavior is a function of how our brains work and not the result of interview participants trying to deceive us. In fact, many of these biases come into play because our interview subjects are trying to be helpful.

We see these errors show up in many contexts. Physically active adults overestimate how often they work out. Countless Americans underestimate how much alcohol they drink. The majority of us think we are above-average drivers, healthy eaters, and great listeners. It gets worse. Like the woman buying jeans, we think we understand why we do the things we do. But the reality is, our brains are exceptionally good at creating coherent (but not necessarily true) stories that deceive us.

Michael Gazzaniga, a neuropsychologist at the University of California Santa Barbara, conducted a phenomenal study that shows just how effective our brains are at deceiving us.24 He constructed an experiment protocol in which split-brain patients were shown an image such that it was visible to only their left eye and asked the participant to select a related card with their left hand. Left-eye vision and left-side body movement are controlled by the right hemisphere. In a split-brain patient, the connection between the right and left hemispheres has been severed, meaning no information can cross from one hemisphere to the other. Therefore, in this protocol, the right hemisphere was doing all of the work, and the left hemisphere was unaware of what was happening.

Gazzaniga then asked participants why they chose the card that they did. Because language is processed and generated in the left hemisphere, the left hemisphere is required to respond. However, because of the protocol design, only the right hemisphere knows why the participant selected the card. As a result, Gazzaniga expected the participants to be stumped. But that isn’t what happened. Instead, every subject fabricated a response.

The left hemisphere was being asked to provide a rationalization for a behavior done by the right hemisphere. The left hemisphere didn’t know the answer. But that didn’t keep the left hemisphere from fabricating an answer. That answer, however, had no basis in reality.

Now if this study had been limited to split-brain patients, it would be interesting but not very relevant to us. It turns out split-brain patients aren’t the only ones who fabricate reasons. We all do it. Gazzaniga named this tendency to rationalize our behavior even when we can’t possibly know the reason as the “left brain interpreter,” and later studies have shown that we all have an active “left brain interpreter.”25 We need to reconcile the present with the past, and when information is missing, our brains simply fill in details that make the story coherent.

This is exactly why in Thinking, Fast and Slow, behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman claimed, “A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped.” Your brain will gladly give you an answer. That answer, however, may not be grounded in reality. In fact, Kahneman outlines dozens of ways our brains get it wrong. It’s also why Kahneman argues confidence isn’t a good indicator of truth or reality. He writes, “Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it.” Not necessarily the truth.

As long as your brain can summon a compelling reason, it will feel like the truth—even if it isn’t. Gazzaniga’s participants thought they knew why they selected the card that they did. The left-brain interpreter filled in the missing details, creating a coherent story. The participant was confident—and, unfortunately, wrong.

Gazzaniga’s study means you can’t simply ask your customers about their behavior and expect to get an accurate answer. Most will obligingly give you what sounds like a reasonable answer. But you won’t know if they are telling you about their ideal behavior or their actual behavior. Nor will you know if they are simply telling you a coherent story that sounds true but isn’t true in practice.

I learned this the hard way. Back in 2007, I worked on a product that helped corporate recruiters source candidates. At that time, the hype in the recruiting industry was around recruiting passive candidates—candidates who were currently employed but open to new opportunities. There was a belief (and probably still is today) that passive candidates were better than active candidates—those who were unemployed and ready to apply for jobs right now. Thought leaders in the recruiting space advocated for recruiting passive candidates. Every customer I talked to told me they wanted to source passive candidates. I thought we had uncovered a real need. So, we built a passive-candidate-recruiting solution. It flopped.

Corporate recruiters said they wanted to source passive candidates. It’s what their ideal selves wanted. It’s what they aspired to. But when it came time to fill an open position, they sourced active candidates again and again. Why did this happen? Because recruiters are often measured by how fast they can fill an open role, and active candidates are the fastest way to do that. Even though recruiters aspired to source passive candidates, what they actually did was source active candidates. It’s the equivalent of opening a salad bar across from a McDonald’s because customers said they wanted to eat healthier. We can’t be too surprised when our salads lose out to the Big Mac.

Our failure wasn’t due to a lack of research. It was because we asked our customers the wrong questions. We built a product based on a coherent story told by both the thought leaders in our space and by our customers themselves. But it wasn’t a story that was based in reality. If you want to build a successful product, you need to understand your customers’ actual behavior—their reality—not the story they tell themselves.

Too often in customer interviews, we ask direct questions. We ask, “What criteria do you use when purchasing a pair of jeans?” Or we ask, “How often do you go to the gym?” But these types of questions invoke our ideal selves, and they encourage our brains to generate coherent but not necessarily reliable responses. In the coming pages, you’ll learn a far more reliable method for learning about your customers’ actual behavior.

Distinguish Research Questions From Interview Questions

The key to interviewing well is to distinguish what you are trying to learn (your research questions) from what you ask in the interview (your interview questions). Most product teams could generate an infinite list of research questions. There is always more to learn about our customers. We see some teams solve this by generating multi-page discussion guides. But this strategy assumes that you’ll be talking to customers only occasionally, therefore, you need to ask them everything right now. Instead, assume you’ll talk to customers every week, and focus on what you need to learn at this moment in time.

In any given interview, you’ll want to balance broadly exploring the needs, pain points, and desires that matter most to that particular customer and diving deep on the specific opportunities that are most relevant to you. Every customer is unique, and, no matter how well you recruit, you may find that your customer doesn’t care about the opportunity you most need to learn about. We don’t want to spend time exploring a specific opportunity with a customer if that opportunity isn’t important to them. Our primary research question in any interview should be: What needs, pain points, and desires matter most to this customer?

Once we’ve explored the opportunities that matter most to the customer, we can dive into the specifics of any of those opportunities. You may have specific opportunities in mind, but you’ll want to let your participant set the direction of the interview. Remember, what matters most to your customer trumps what you need to learn.

Since we can’t ask our customers direct questions about their behavior, the best way to learn about their needs, pain points, and desires is to ask them to share specific stories about their experience. You’ll need to translate your research questions into interview questions that elicit these stories. Memories about recent instances are more reliable than our generalizations about our own behavior or our answers to direct questions.

Instead of asking, “What criteria do you use when purchasing a pair of jeans?”—a direct question that encourages our participant to speculate about their behavior—we want to ask, “Tell me about the last time you purchased a pair of jeans.” The story will help us uncover what criteria our participant used when purchasing a pair of jeans, but because the answer is situated in a specific instance (an actual time when they bought jeans), it will reflect their actual behavior, not their perceived behavior.

Finding the right story question can be challenging. The scope of the story that you’ll want to elicit will change throughout your discovery process. For example, if you work at a streaming-entertainment company and you are trying to increase viewer engagement, you might ask, “Tell me about the last time you watched our streaming-entertainment service.” This question will help you learn about pain points and challenges with your product.

But you may want to widen the scope. You might say, “Tell me about the last time you watched any streaming entertainment.” This question will elicit stories about your product but also stories about your competitors. You could broaden the scope even further to, “Tell me about the last time you were entertained.” This might elicit stories about going to a movie theater, attending a concert, socializing with friends, and much more. This type of question is a great way to uncover what your product category (e.g., streaming entertainment) competes with.

You’ll want to tailor the scope of the question based on what you need to learn at that moment in time. A narrow scope will help you optimize your existing product. Broader questions will help you uncover new opportunities. The broadest questions might help you uncover new markets. The appropriate scope will depend on the scope you set when creating your experience map (see Chapter 4).

Excavate the Story

As the interviewer, you will have to work to excavate the story. If you ask a participant to tell you about the last time they watched streaming entertainment, they will likely respond with something along the lines of: “I watched The Good Place last night after dinner.” That’s not a very good story.

Conversational norms set the expectation for a 50/50 back-and-forth pattern when two people are conversing. This means that each person spends roughly 50% of the time talking. I say something, and then you say something. If I ask you a short question, you are likely to respond with a short answer. As the interviewer, you need to reset this expectation. One of the most effective ways to do this is to inform your participant that you would like them to share their full story with you, to share as many details as possible, to leave nothing out, and that, when they are done with their story, you’ll ask for missing details.

Even so, you may still have to dig to uncover the full story. You can use common storytelling tactics to help you do so. A good story has a protagonist who encounters experiences on a timeline. Temporal prompts are one of the most effective ways to guide the participant through their own story. You can ask, “Start at the beginning. What happened first?” You can use the experience map you created in Chapter 4 to help guide your participant. Prompt for the beginning of the story. If your participant isn’t sure where to start, you can further prompt, “Where were you? Set the scene for me.” As the participant tells their story, you can encourage them to keep going by asking them, “What happened next?” Sometimes they might skip a few steps, and you may need to ask, “What happened before that?” Thinking about their story as having a beginning, a middle, and an end can help you guide the participant. Use your customer-experience map to help you track their story. Listen for specific nodes. Ask about nodes that were left out of the story.

Stories also take place in specific locations; protagonists encounter challenges, and they receive help from supporting characters. Other characters might present obstacles or interfere with the protagonist’s progress. Keep these elements in mind as they’ll help you tease out what the participant forgets. You might ask, “Who was with you?” “What challenges did you encounter?” “How did you overcome that challenge?” “Did anyone help you?”

You’ll notice, as you excavate the story, that your participant will bounce back and forth between the story they are telling and generalizing about their behavior. You might ask, “What challenges did you face?” and they may respond with, “I usually…” or, “In general, I have this challenge…” You’ll want to gently guide them back to telling you about this specific instance. You might say, “In this specific example, did you face that challenge?”

Excavating the story takes practice. It might feel awkward at first. It will definitely feel inefficient. When your participant jumps to a generalization (e.g., “I always face this challenge”), it’s going to feel like a shortcut. It’s going to tempt you to conclude that’s the real need, pain point, or desire. In those moments, it’s critical that you remember the research on how poorly we perform at answering direct questions and how susceptible our responses are to cognitive biases.

Keep the interview grounded in specific stories to ensure that you collect data about your participants’ actual behavior, not their perceived behavior. And remember, like most of the habits in this book, it takes practice. Don’t get discouraged. Keep at it. You will get better with time.

You Won’t Always Get What You Want

With story-based interviewing, you won’t always collect the story that you want. That’s okay. The golden rule of interviewing is to let the participant talk about what they care about most. You can steer the conversation in two ways.

First, you decide which type of story to collect. You can ask a more open question like: “Tell me about the last time you watched streaming entertainment.” Or you can ask for a more specific story: “Tell me about the last time you watched streaming entertainment on a mobile device.”

Second, you can use your story prompts to dig deeper into different parts of the story. If you are primarily concerned with how they chose what to watch, dig into that part of the story. If you aren’t particularly interested in what device they watch on, don’t ask for that detail if they leave it out of their story. Let your research questions guide your story prompts.

However, even so, you might encounter some participants who simply don’t cooperate. They might not have a relevant story. They might be motivated to tell you about a different part of the story. They might not want to tell you a story at all. They might give one-sentence answers. Or they might want to share their feature ideas or gripe about how your product works.

In these instances, you’ll want to do the best you can to capture the value the participant is willing to share, but don’t force it. You always want to respect what the participant cares about most. Remember, with continuous interviewing, you’ll be interviewing another customer soon enough. When we rarely interview, a disappointing interview can feel painful. When we interview continuously, a disappointing interview is easily forgotten.

Synthesize as You Go

When you continuously interview customers, there’s no clear point at which to stop and synthesize what you are learning. Instead, you’ll need to synthesize as you go. Meet the interview snapshot.

An interview snapshot is a one-pager designed to help you synthesize what you learned in a single interview. It’s how you are going to turn your copious notes into actionable insights. Your collection of snapshots will act as a reference or index to the customer knowledge bank you are building through continuous interviewing.

After you’ve conducted even a handful of interviews, let alone the dozens you will conduct each year, interviews will start to blur together. You don’t want to rely on your memory to keep your research straight. That’s the job of an interview snapshot. Snapshots are designed to help you remember specific stories. They help you identify opportunities and insights from each and every interview.

The cliché “A picture is worth a thousand words” is true. The more visual your snapshot, the easier it will be for the team to remember the stories you collected—even weeks or months later. With permission, include a photo of the participant. Grab one from a social-media profile. Grab a screenshot from a video call. Snap a photo during an in-person interview. If your corporate guidelines require that you anonymize your interview data, or if you are interviewing participants about sensitive topics, skip the photo, and replace it with a visual that will help you remember their specific story. This could be a workplace logo, the car they drive, or even a cat meme that represents their story. The photo should help you put that interview snapshot into context. It should help you remember the stories that you heard.

At the top of the snapshot, include a quote that represents a memorable moment from their story. This might be an emotional quote or a distinct behavior that stood out. Like the photo, the quote acts as a key for unlocking your memory of the specific stories that they told. I can still remember memorable quotes from interviews that I did years ago. A couple of my favorites are “I’ve worked here for three years. But they feel like dog years.” And “I’m old school. Agile doesn’t work for me.” When a participant uses vivid language, be sure to capture their exact words.

To help put a specific interview into context, you’ll want to capture some quick facts about the customer. The quick facts will change from company to company, but they should help you identify what type of customer you were talking to. For example, a service that matches job candidates with companies might segment their employer customers by size (e.g., SMB, enterprise) or they might list average annual contract size. A streaming-entertainment service might list the customer’s sign-up date and average hours watched each week. If they segment further, they might even include behavioral traits like binge-watcher or active referrer. The goal of the quick-facts section is to help you understand how the stories you heard in this interview may be similar to or different from those you heard from other customers.

The photo and the memorable quote will act as keys that help you to unlock your memory of the stories you heard. The quick facts help you situate those stories in the right context. Now you want to capture the heart of what you learned. You’ll do this by identifying the insights and opportunities that you heard in the interview.

An opportunity represents a need, a pain point, or a desire that was expressed during the interview. Be sure to represent opportunities as needs and not solutions. If the participant requests a specific feature or solution, ask about why they need that, and capture the opportunity (rather than the solution). A good way to do this is to ask, “If you had that feature, what would that do for you?” For example, if an interviewee says, “I wish I could just say the name of the movie I’m searching for,” that’s a feature request. If you ask, “What would that do for you?” they might respond, “I don’t want to have to type out a long movie title.” That’s the underlying need. The benefit of capturing the need and not just the solution is that the need opens up more of the solution space. We could add voice search to address this need, but we also could auto-complete movie titles as they type.

Opportunities don’t need to be exact quotes, but you should frame them using your customer’s words. This will help ensure that you are capturing the opportunity from your customer’s perspective and not from your company’s perspective.

Throughout the interview, you might hear interesting insights that don’t represent needs, pain points, or desires. Perhaps the participant shares some unique behavior that you want to capture, but you aren’t sure yet what to do with this information. Capture these insights on your interview snapshot. Over time, insights often turn into opportunities.

The goal with the snapshot is to capture as much of what you heard in each interview as possible. It’s easy to discount a behavior as unique to a particular participant, but you should still capture what you heard on the interview snapshot. Be as thorough as possible. You’ll be surprised how often an opportunity that seems unique to one customer becomes a common pattern heard in several interviews.

Draw the Stories You Collect

The experience map that you created in Chapter 4 will help guide each interview. As you collect each customer’s unique story, you’ll want to actively listen for how their story is similar to or different from your generalized experience map.

One of the most important elements to capture on the interview snapshot is an experience map that captures each participant’s unique story. When creating an interview snapshot, our goal is to process and understand what we heard and to capture it in a way that will make our research referenceable and actionable in the future. These stories give us the knowledge we need to design for the right person, in the right context, at the right time. But it can only do that if we capture enough of the story to remember it when we need it.

Drawing the underlying structure of the stories that you hear—and, by that, I mean the nodes and the links that make up the story—will help you remember the story. It will help you better understand the story. We’ll also see in the next chapter that drawing stories will help you find patterns across seemingly unique stories, which will be critical for making your body of research actionable. Drawing is a superpower that will help you unlock valuable insights from each interview.

Just as you saw in Chapter 4, drawing helps your team align around a shared understanding. Taking the time to capture visually what you learned from each interview will help you stay aligned as you learn more about your customers.

Interview Every Week

Weekly interviewing is foundational to a strong discovery practice. Interviewing helps us explore an ever-evolving opportunity space. Customer needs change. New products disrupt markets. Competitors change the landscape. As our products and services evolve, new needs, pain points, and desires arise. A digital product is never done, and the opportunity space is never finite or complete.

If interviewing is about discovering opportunities, it’s easy to think that, once you’ve chosen a target opportunity, you can pause interviewing. But this assumes that you chose the right target opportunity, that you’ll be able to address that opportunity, and that everything will go according to plan. If you need to change course and you’ve stopped interviewing, you’ll have to start from scratch. Your next steps will be delayed until you can ramp up interviewing again. We don’t want to think about interviewing as a step in a linear process. Instead, our goal is to interview continuously.

Raya Raycheva, a senior user researcher at Simply Business, an insurance company based in London, England, highlights the value of continuous interviewing:

“We recently had to pivot from one opportunity to another when we learned that the need we were exploring wasn’t that important to our customers. Fortunately, because we were continuously interviewing, we didn’t have to start from scratch. We could revisit our opportunity solution tree, choose a new opportunity, and start learning about it in our next set of interviews. We killed an opportunity on Tuesday, chose a new one on Wednesday, and used our already-scheduled interviews on Thursday to learn about the new opportunity.”

From a habit standpoint, it’s much easier to maintain a habit than to start and stop a habit. If you interview every week, you’ll be more likely to keep interviewing every week. Every week that you don’t interview increases the chances that you’ll stop interviewing altogether. To nurture your interviewing habit, interview at least one customer every week.

Automate the Recruiting Process

The hardest part about continuous interviews is finding people to talk to. In order to make continuous interviewing sustainable, we need to automate the recruiting process. Your goal is to wake up Monday morning with a weekly interview scheduled without you having to do anything.

Some teams have no problem recruiting interview participants, and they skip over this step. However, every team has weeks in which something goes wrong—a release goes awry, a significant prospect is at risk, a key team member is unexpectedly sick. It’s during these weeks (that happen far more often than we like to admit) that you’ll want to fall back on your recruitment automation to help you sustain your weekly interviewing habit.

When a customer interview is automatically added to your calendar each week, it becomes easier to interview than not to interview. This is your goal.

Recruit Participants While They Are Using Your Product or Service

The most common and easiest way to find interview participants is to recruit them while they are using your product or service. You can integrate a single question into the flow of your product: “Do you have 20 minutes to talk with us about your experience in exchange for $20?” Be sure to customize the copy to reflect the ask-and-offer that works best for your audience. If the visitor answers “Yes,” ask for their phone number.

This strategy works best for high-traffic sites, where you can turn the survey on for a few minutes and get a response right away. If you don’t have a high-traffic service, it may take hours or even days to get your first response. In this case, instead of asking for a phone number, ask the visitor to schedule an interview. Use scheduling software to reduce the back-and-forth required to find an available time.

For new products or services with few or no customers, you can still implement this strategy. Instead of recruiting people while they use your product (as it may not exist yet), you can use ads to drive traffic to a landing page. You can recruit people directly from the landing page.

Ask Your Customer-Facing Colleagues to Recruit

Most companies have teams who are on the phone with customers day in and day out. This includes sales teams, account managers, customer-success teams, and customer-support teams.

You can work with these teams to help you recruit interview participants. The easiest place to start is to ask a customer-facing colleague if you can join one of their existing meetings. Start by asking for five minutes at the end of a call. You want to make it as easy as possible for both your colleague and your customer to say “Yes.” Use the last few minutes of an existing call to collect a specific story about the customer.

Once your customer-facing teams are comfortable with you joining their meetings, ask your customer-facing colleagues to help you schedule an interview with one of their customers. To make this work, you’ll want to define triggers to help your customer-facing colleagues identify who to reach out to. Triggers might include:

- If a customer calls to cancel their subscription, schedule an interview.
- If a customer has a question about feature x, schedule an interview.
- If a customer requests a customization, schedule an interview.

Triggers can change week over week. The key is to clearly communicate to your customer-facing team who you would like to interview and to make it easy for them to schedule the interview. Give them a script to follow. It might be as simple as this: If the customer trigger occurs, then say: “I’d love for you to share your feedback with our product team. Can we schedule 20 minutes for you to talk with them?” If they say “Yes,” have your colleague schedule the interview.

Interview Your Customer Advisory Board

If your customers are particularly hard to reach (e.g., doctors, CEOs), or if you have a small market (e.g., Canadian business schools, movie studios), the recruiting strategies we’ve covered will be challenging. Your customer’s time is either too valuable, or you’ll have concerns about reaching out to the same customers over and over again.

While most product teams worry their customers are too busy to talk with them, for most teams, this won’t be true. We dramatically underestimate how much our customers want to help. If you are solving a real need and your product plays an important role in your customers’ lives, they will be eager to help make it better. However, there are some audiences that are extremely hard to reach. In these instances, setting up a customer-advisory board will help.

Most companies use their customer-advisory boards to host focus groups. That may be valuable, but it’s not a replacement for interviews. You can also use your customer-advisory board as interview participants. Invite your advisory-board members to participate in a monthly one-on-one interview. Offer an ongoing incentive as a reward for their participation.

You can scale the size of your customer-advisory board to reflect the number of interviews that your product teams need each month. If you have three product teams that each want to do one interview per week, you would invite 12 customers to participate on your advisory board.

One advantage of interviewing the same customers month over month is that you get to learn about their context in-depth and see how it changes over time. The risk is that you’ll design your product for a small subset of customers that might not reflect the broader market. You can pair this recruiting method with one or two of the other methods to avoid this fate.

Interview Together, Act Together

Product trios should interview together. Some teams prefer to let one role, usually the product manager or the designer, be the “voice of the customer.” However, our goal as a product trio is to collaborate in a way that leverages everyone’s expertise. If one person is the “voice of the customer,” that role will trump every other role.

Imagine that a product manager and a designer disagree on how to proceed. The designer has done all the interviewing. It’s easy for the designer to argue, “This is what the customer wants.” Whether or not that is true, the product manager has no response to that. Designating one person as the “voice of the customer” gives that person too much power in a team decision-making model. The goal is for all team members to be the voice of the customer.

Additionally, the more diverse your interviewing team, the more value you will get from each interview. What we hear in an interview will be influenced by our prior knowledge and experience.26 A product manager will hear things that an engineer might not pick up on, and vice versa.

What does this look like in practice? Imagine you are interviewing a Netflix customer, and they tell you the following story:

Last night my wife and I, as we were finishing up dinner, decided we wanted to watch a movie. We wanted to watch on our big TV in the living room—it has better sound than the den—but our son was playing video games, so we had to wait for him to get to a good save point before he could switch to the den. As we waited, we scrolled through Netflix’s movie selection on our iPad to figure out what we wanted to watch. Most of our recommendations were for kids’ movies because it’s mostly our kids who use the account. We tried “Most popular,” but it was all TV shows. My wife remembered hearing about a good movie, but we couldn’t figure out how to search for a specific movie title. It was very frustrating.

The product manager might key in on, “‘Most popular’ was all TV shows” because they’ve been concerned that we don’t have the right content. The designer might hear, “We couldn’t figure out how to search for a specific movie title” because they are primarily interested in improving the user experience. The engineer might hear, “Most of the recommendations were for kids’ movies” because they might be interested in finding a technical way to detect different types of users. All three selected different data as salient because of the perspectives they brought to the interview.

Each perspective is valid and can lead to an important product improvement. The more diversity in the room, the more value you’ll get from each interview. And remember, an interview can be as short as five minutes. Everyone has time to spend a few minutes each week with a customer.

Avoid These Common Anti-Patterns

As you start building your continuous-interviewing habit, avoid these common anti-patterns.

Relying on one person to recruit and interview participants. If someone on your team takes the lead on recruiting and interviewing participants, it’s easy to let them keep doing it. However, you want to avoid this. What happens when that person goes on vacation or is out sick unexpectedly? You don’t want to have to skip or, even worse, cancel an interview because someone else on your team can’t fill the gap. To make sure continuous interviewing is a robust habit, make sure everyone on your team is well-versed in recruiting and interviewing.

Asking who, what, why, how, and when questions. Long discussion guides exist for a reason. They are easy to create, and they allow everyone to get their favorite questions answered. Unfortunately, they lead to overwhelmed interview participants and unreliable interview data. Ditch the discussion guide. Instead, generate a list of research questions (what you need to learn), and identify one or two story-based interview questions (what you’ll ask). Remember, a story-based interview question starts with, “Tell me about a specific time when…”

Interviewing only when you think you need it. It’s easy to think discovery is a linear process. If we interview to identify customer opportunities, why can’t we stop interviewing once we’ve chosen a target opportunity? Remember, it’s much easier to continue a weekly habit than to start and stop a periodic behavior. Continuous interviewing ensures that you stay close to your customers. More importantly, continuous interviewing will help to ensure that you can get fast answers to your daily questions.

Sharing what you learned by sending out pages of notes and/or sharing a recording. A product trio should share what they are learning with the rest of their team, their product peers, and with key stakeholders. However, when we share pages of notes that make sense only to us and/or a video of the full interview, we are expecting our colleagues to put as much effort into our discovery work as we do. This isn’t feasible. They have their own jobs to do. Instead, use your interview snapshots to share what you are learning with the rest of the organization.

Stopping to synthesize a set of interviews. If you are used to a project world, you probably conduct 6 to 12 interviews and then stop to synthesize what you are learning. This usually involves stickies on a whiteboard, maybe some affinity diagramming, and ends in a research report that synthesizes what you learned. This, however, assumes that your interviews had a start and a stop. In a continuous-interviewing world, we don’t start and stop. Instead, we interview every week. Rather than synthesizing a batch of interviews, synthesize as you go, using interview snapshots. The next chapter will also help you structure what you are learning to make it more actionable.
