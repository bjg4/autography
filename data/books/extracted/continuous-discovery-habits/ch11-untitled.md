CHAPTER FOUR

VISUALIZING WHAT YOU KNOW

“Whether actual or virtual, an external representation creates common ground…”

— Barbara Tversky, Mind in Motion

“If we give each other time to explain ourselves using words and pictures, we build shared understanding.”

— Jeff Patton, User Story Mapping

I coached a newly formed product trio who was tasked with an outcome for the first time. Their product required a long application process that some customers neglected to complete. This team’s outcome was to increase the rate of application submissions. Each member of the trio had their own idea about what was preventing customers from submitting their application. And each person brought a unique set of knowledge and experiences to the trio. The product manager had been with the company for a couple of years but was new to the product-manager role. The designer was the company’s new Vice President of Design and joined a trio to get an on-the-ground view of how the company worked. The engineer had the longest tenure at the company but had little discovery experience.

In the previous chapter, you learned that, to chart the best path to a desired outcome, you need to discover and map out the opportunity space. However, the opportunity space is infinite. You can’t just dive in. You’ll quickly get lost. To make sense of the opportunity space, we first need to take an inventory of what we already know. This is especially critical on cross-functional teams, where each member brings a diverse set of knowledge and experiences.

When working with an outcome for the first time, it can feel overwhelming to know where to start. It helps to first map out your customers’ experience as it exists today. This trio started by mapping out what they thought was preventing their customers from submitting their applications. But they didn’t do so by getting together in a room to discuss what they knew. Instead, they started out with each product-trio member mapping out their own perspective. This was uncomfortable at first. The designer had little context for what might be going wrong. The engineer had a lot of technical knowledge but had little firsthand contact with customers. The product manager had some hunches as to what was going wrong but didn’t have any analytics to confirm those hunches. They each did the best they could.

Once they had each created their individual map, they took the time to explore each other’s perspectives. The product manager had the best grasp of the “known” challenges—the customer complaints that made their way to their call center and through support tickets. The designer missed a few steps in the process but did a great job of capturing the confusion and insecurity that the customer might be feeling in the process. Because he was new to the company, he was able to view the application process from an outsider’s perspective. The engineer’s map accurately captured the process and added detail about how one step informed another step. This uncovered insights into how a customer might get derailed if an earlier step had been completed incorrectly.

Each map represented a unique perspective—together they represented a much richer understanding of the opportunity space they intended to explore. The trio quickly worked to merge their unique perspectives into a shared experience map that better reflected what they collectively knew. Their map wasn’t set in stone. They knew that it contained hunches and possibilities, not truth. But it gave them a clear starting point. They had made explicit what they thought they knew, where they had open questions, and what they needed to vet in their upcoming customer interviews.

This chapter will teach you how to use your desired outcome as a starting point to work your way—first individually, and then as a team—to an experience map that reflects what you know about your customers’ experience today. You’ll learn to visualize your own perspective, explore the perspectives of your teammates, and then use the myriad of perspectives to co-create a shared team understanding. This shared map will guide your customer interviews, and it will help give structure to the opportunity space. It can and should evolve week over week as your team learns about your customers.

Set the Scope of Your Experience Map

To get started, you’ll want to first set the scope of your experience map. If you start jotting down everything you know about your customer, you’ll quickly get overwhelmed. Instead, start with your desired outcome. The trio in the opening story was trying to increase application submissions, so they mapped out what they thought their customers’ experience was as they filled out the application. They specifically focused on this question: “What’s preventing our customers from completing their application today?” Their outcome constrained what they tried to capture.

Think strategically about how broad or narrow to set the scope. When a team is focused on an optimization outcome, like increasing application submissions, it’s fine to define the scope narrowly. However, when working on a more open-ended outcome, you’ll want to expand the scope of your experience map.

For example, if we worked at a streaming-entertainment company (e.g., Netflix, Hulu) and we were tasked with an outcome like “increase the average minutes watched,” we might set our scope broadly: “How do customers entertain themselves today?” With this scope, we might capture everything we know about how customers choose, engage with, and consume streaming entertainment. But given the scope of the question, we might also capture what we know about their behavior when socializing with friends, attending sporting events and concerts, reading books, and playing video games. This might be the right scope, if we are looking to explore adjacent markets. But for most teams, this scope is too broad.

However, we don’t want to define our scope too narrowly, either. If we define our scope as “How do customers entertain themselves using our service?” we rule out any inspiration we might get from how they use other streaming-entertainment services, how they entertain themselves through their cable or satellite-dish packages, or how they entertain themselves through services like Twitch and YouTube. If, however, we define our scope as “How do customers entertain themselves with video?” we constrain the scope, but not too much.

Now you could easily argue that the scope should be “How do customers entertain themselves with video, music, and video games?” Or even, “How do customers entertain themselves online?” These options could all work. There’s not one right scope. The key is to have a conversation as a team about the scope that gives you room to explore while staying focused on your outcome. Once you’ve defined the scope of your experience map, you are ready to take an inventory of your individual knowledge before working to develop a shared understanding of what you collectively know.

Start Individually to Avoid Groupthink

It’s easy when working in a team to experience groupthink. Groupthink occurs when a group of individuals underperform due to the dynamics of the group. There are a number of reasons for this. When working in a group, it’s common for some members to put in more effort than others; some group members may hesitate or even refrain from speaking up, and groups tend to perform at the level of the least-capable member.19 In order to leverage the knowledge and expertise in our trios, we need to actively work to counter groupthink.

To prevent groupthink, it’s critical that each member of the trio start by developing their own perspective before the trio works together to develop a shared perspective. This is counterintuitive. It’s going to feel inefficient. We are used to dividing and conquering, not duplicating work. But in instances where it’s important that we explore multiple perspectives, the easiest way to get there is for each product-trio member to do the work individually.

Experience Maps Are Visual, Not Verbal

Many of us stopped drawing sometime in elementary school. As a result, we have the drawing skills of a child. This makes drawing uncomfortable. Regardless of how well you draw, drawing is a critical thinking aid that you will want to tap into. Drawing allows us to externalize our thinking, which, in turn, helps us examine that thinking. When we draw an experience map, rather than verbalize it, it’s easier to see gaps in our thinking, to catch what’s missing, and to correct what’s not quite right.20

If you are feeling intimidated by the idea of drawing an experience map, don’t worry. You don’t need to draw well. You can draw boxes and arrows, stick figures, and squiggly shapes that mean something only to you. The goal is not to create a piece of art but rather to visualize your thinking so that you can examine it.

Start with the scope of your experience map. Our product trio that opened the chapter started with the question, “What’s preventing our customers from completing the application today?” In our streaming-entertainment example, we might start with the question, “How do consumers entertain themselves with video?”

When thinking about this question, don’t focus on your product. Instead, draw the experience of your customer. For example, our product trio didn’t draw a screen-by-screen wireflow of their application process. Instead, they drew the process as their customers perceived it. They captured where they got stuck, what went wrong, how they course-corrected, and where they eventually abandoned the process.

In our streaming-entertainment example, we don’t want to draw a screen-by-screen flow of how to use Netflix. Instead, we want to think about the broader context. When and where does video play a role in a user’s life? How do they hear about content? How do they make decisions about what to do when? Who do they do it with? What challenges and obstacles do they face along the way?

The following is a simple experience map that might address the question, “How do customers entertain themselves with videos?” It starts with how someone might hear about content, who they share it with, the need to search for it, the challenges that might arise from trying to find it, the viewing experience, and, ultimately, success. As we learn about our customers, we’ll add far more detail to the map, including the myriad of ways people hear about content, the different services they might have to bounce between, the different devices they watch on, and so much more.

As you get started, you are going to be tempted to describe this context with words. Don’t. Language is vague. It’s easy for two people to think they are in agreement over the course of a conversation, but, still, each might walk away with a different perspective. Drawing is more specific. It forces you to be concrete. You can’t draw something specific if you haven’t taken the time to get clear on what those specifics are. Your goal during this exercise is to do the work to understand what you know, not to generalize vague thoughts about your customer. So set aside some time, grab a pen and paper, and start drawing. Push through the discomfort of being a beginner, and you’ll be reaping the benefits in no time.

Once each member of your trio has taken the time to inventory what they know, it’s time to explore the diverse perspectives on your team.

Explore the Diverse Perspectives on Your Team

Take turns sharing your drawings among your trio. As you explore your teammates’ perspectives, ask questions to make sure you fully understand their point of view. Give them time and space to clarify what they think and why they think it. Don’t worry about what they got right or wrong (from your perspective). Instead, pay particular attention to the differences. Be curious.

When it’s your turn to share, don’t advocate for your drawing. Simply share your point of view, answer questions, and clarify your thinking.

Remember, everyone’s perspective can and should contribute to the team’s shared understanding. We saw in our opening story that the trio’s shared map was stronger because they synthesized the unique perspectives on the team into a richer experience map than any of them could have individually created.

Once you have a clear understanding of each team member’s perspective, you are ready to start building a shared team perspective.

Co-Create a Shared Experience Map

As you work together to co-create a shared experience map, focus on synthesizing your work together rather than choosing the “best” drawing to move forward with.

Start by turning each of your individual maps into a collection of nodes and links. A node is a distinct moment in time, an action, or an event, while links are what connect nodes together. For example, my map of how customers entertain themselves might include the following nodes: hearing about a new show, discussing it with their significant other, a searching or browsing moment, the error case of not being able to find the content, the time spent being entertained, and the end of the entertainment session. Links help show relationships between the nodes. For example, I might loop back several times in this process. Perhaps I choose Netflix but can’t find anything to watch, so I switch to YouTube. Links can show the movement through the nodes.

Create a new map that includes all of your individual nodes. Arrange the nodes from all of your individual maps into a new, comprehensive map.

Collapse similar nodes together. Many of your individual maps will include overlapping nodes. Feel free to collapse similar nodes together. However, be careful. Make sure you are collapsing like items and not generalizing so much that you lose key detail.

Determine the links between each node. Use arrows to show the flow through the nodes. Don’t just map out the happy path. Remember to capture where steps need to be redone, where people might give up out of frustration, or where steps might loop back on themselves.

Add context. Once you have a map that represents the nodes and links of your customer’s journey, add context to each step. What are they thinking, feeling, and doing at each step of the journey? Try to capture this context visually. It will help the team (and your stakeholders) synthesize what you know, and it will be easier to build on this shared understanding.

Avoid Common Anti-Patterns

As you work to visualize what you know, avoid these common anti-patterns.

Getting bogged down in endless debate. If you find yourself debating minute details, try to draw out your differences instead of debating them. We often debate details when we already agree. We just don’t realize we already agree. When you are forced to draw an idea, you have to get specific enough to define what it is. This often helps to quickly clear up the disagreement or to pinpoint exactly where the disagreement occurs. Drawing really is a magic tool in your toolbox. Use it often.

Using words instead of visuals. Because many of us are uncomfortable with our drawing skills, we tend to revert back to words and sentences. Instead, use boxes and arrows. Remember, you don’t have to create a piece of art. Stick figures and smiley faces are perfectly okay. But drawing engages a different part of your brain than language does. It helps us see patterns that are hard to detect in words and sentences. When I was first learning to draw, I was reluctant. I still don’t draw well, but I now draw every day. The more you draw, the more you’ll realize drawing is a superpower.

Moving forward as if your map is true. One of the drawbacks of documenting a customer-experience map is that it can start to feel like truth. Remember, this is your first draft, intended to capture what you think you know about your customer. We’ll test this understanding in our customer interviews and again when we start to explore solutions.

Forgetting to refine and evolve your map as you learn more. It can be easy to think of this activity as a one-time event. However, as you discover more about your customer, you’ll want to make sure that you continue to hone and refine this map as a team. Otherwise, you’ll find that your individual perspectives will quickly start to diverge even when you are working with the same set of source data. Each person will take away different points from the same customer interview or the same assumption test. You’ll want to continuously synthesize what you collectively know so that you maintain a shared understanding of your customer context.
