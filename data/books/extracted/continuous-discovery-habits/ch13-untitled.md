CHAPTER SIX

MAPPING THE OPPORTUNITY SPACE

“To maintain the state of doubt and to carry on systematic and protracted inquiry—these are the essentials of thinking.”

— John Dewey, How We Think

“Structure is complicated. It gets done, undone, and redone.”

— Barbara Tversky, Mind in Motion

Ahmed Guijou, a product director at Seera Group, had his world turned upside down overnight. He wasn’t the only one. It was March 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic had exploded around the world. Countries instituted stay-at-home orders, businesses shuttered, and travel ground to a halt. Before the pandemic, Guijou’s team was on a mission to help “customers book their dream vacation or their business-trip accommodations in the easiest way possible.” Once the pandemic hit, Saudi Arabia, home to most of Seera Group’s customers, closed its borders, and Guijou’s team saw their hotel-bookings business drop off overnight.

However, it wasn’t all bad news. They noticed that some of their customers started looking for alternative accommodations closer to home. Instead of booking hotels and apartments in foreign countries, their customers were starting to book Istrahas. Istraha means “resting place” in Arabic and generally refers to a large property with an outdoor area, barbecue, and a pool. Guijou’s team, in previous customer interviews, had already uncovered that these properties were often used as day rentals to host social gatherings near home. While customers were no longer booking hotel accommodations, demand for Istrahas grew. Customers were looking for a safe place to connect with friends and family in the midst of a pandemic.

If Guijou and his team were to react to this shift in customer behavior, they had a lot to learn and little time to do so. Their marketplace had little Istraha inventory, and the team needed to figure out how to entice hosts to share their properties and how to get guests to consider their platform as the place to book. Guijou’s team turned to their continuous discovery habits to guide them. They started interviewing Istraha hosts and guests. They uncovered countless opportunities on both sides of the marketplace. Rather than getting overwhelmed, they started mapping out the needs of each group on respective opportunity solution trees. They spent a few weeks collecting and sorting opportunities until patterns started to emerge. Guijou’s team started grouping similar opportunities together. They paid particular attention to the needs, pain points, and desires that were specific to Istraha rentals. With each interview, the structure of the opportunity space continued to evolve.

When they felt they had a good understanding of the opportunity space, they took a step back to assess where they were. They looked for overlap between what hosts and guests each needed. They considered what their competition did well and where they saw gaps where they could compete. They started to see how they could leverage their existing strengths to play in this space.

By mapping out the opportunity space, Guijou’s team was able to quickly assess where they could have an impact. In a few short weeks, they went from watching their business get disrupted overnight to identifying a new market opportunity and developing a product strategy for how they could tap into it.27 That’s the power of opportunity mapping.

The Power of Opportunity Mapping

As you collect customers’ stories, you are going to hear about countless needs, pain points, and desires. Our customers’ stories are rife with gaps between what they expect and how the world works. Each gap represents an opportunity to serve your customer. However, it’s easy to get overwhelmed and not know where to start. Even if you worked tirelessly in addressing opportunity after opportunity for the rest of your career, you would never fully satisfy your customers’ desires. This is why digital products are never complete. How do we decide which opportunities are more important than others? How do we know which should be addressed now and which can be pushed to tomorrow? It’s hard to answer either of these questions if we don’t first take an inventory of the opportunity space.

A single customer story might elicit dozens of opportunities. If you interview continuously, your opportunity space will always be evolving—expanding as you learn about new needs, contracting as you address known problems, and gaining clarity as you learn more about specific pain points. Mapping the opportunity space is a critical activity. Finding the best path to your desired outcome is an ill-structured problem (introduced in Chapter 2) and requires that we first structure or frame the problem space before we can dive into solving it. Mapping the opportunity space is how we give structure to the ill-structured problem of reaching our desired outcome.

It’s easy, however, to bounce from one opportunity to the next, reacting to every need or pain point we hear about. Most product teams are devoted to serving their customers, and, when they hear about a need or a pain point, they want to solve it. But our job is not to address every customer opportunity. Our job is to address customer opportunities that drive our desired outcome. This is how we create value for our business while creating value for our customers. Limiting our work to only the opportunities that might drive our desired outcome is what ensures that our products are viable over the long run and not just desirable in the moment.

Our goal should be to address the customer opportunities that will have the biggest impact on our outcome first. To do this, we need to start by taking an inventory of the possibilities. In the first quote that opens this chapter, John Dewey, an American educational philosopher, encourages us to “carry on systematic and protracted inquiry.” Rather than jumping to the first need that we might address, Dewey argues, good thinking requires that we explore our options—that we carry out a systematic search for longer than we feel comfortable. We should compare and contrast the impact of addressing one opportunity against the impact of addressing another opportunity. We want to be deliberate and systematic in our search for the highest-impact opportunity.

In the second quote that opens this chapter, cognitive psychologist Barbara Tversky reminds us that structure “gets done, undone, and redone.” As the opportunity space grows and evolves, we’ll have to give structure to it again and again. As we continue to learn from our customers, we’ll reframe known opportunities to better match what we are hearing. As we better understand how our customers think about their world, we’ll move opportunities from one branch of the tree to another. We’ll rephrase opportunities that aren’t specific enough. We’ll group similar opportunities together. These tasks will require rigorous critical thinking, but the effort will help to ensure that we are always addressing the most impactful opportunity.

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to take an inventory of the opportunities that you are hearing in your interviews, and you’ll learn how to give structure to the opportunity space in a way that ensures that you are always marching toward your desired outcome.

Taming Opportunity Backlogs

Some teams are already capturing opportunities in an opportunity backlog—a prioritized list of opportunities. They prioritize their list of customer needs, pain points, and desires the same way they prioritize their user stories in their development backlog.

This is a great place to start. It’s better than working with only one opportunity at a time. However, it can be hard to prioritize a flat list of opportunities, because opportunities come in different shapes and sizes. Some opportunities are interrelated, while others are subsets of others.

If we continue with our streaming-entertainment example, we might start with the following list of opportunities:

- I can’t find anything to watch.
- I’m out of episodes of my favorite shows.
- I can’t figure out how to search for a specific show.
- I don’t know when a new season is available.
- The show I was watching is no longer available.
- I fell asleep, and several episodes kept playing.
- I want to watch my shows on my flight.
- I want to skip the show intro.
- Is this show any good?
- I want to know what my friends are watching.
- Who is that actor?
- I want to watch my shows on my train commute.

I don’t know how to compare “I can’t find anything to watch” with “I’m out of episodes of my favorite shows.” These opportunities are not distinct. Running out of episodes of your favorite show is a reason why you might not have anything to watch. But it’s not the only reason, so these aren’t exactly the same, either.

“I want to watch my shows on my flight” and “I want to watch my shows on my train commute” sound similar. Are these really the same opportunity? Maybe they can be combined into, “I want to watch on the go.” That might be right. Unless planes and trains introduce different constraints. I may need to be completely offline on a plane, whereas, on a train, I may still have cell data. I might have access to a power outlet on a plane, but not on a train. If these context differences are important to the experience, these opportunities are similar, but not the same. But how do I prioritize them against each other? Can I address them both at the same time?

“Is this show any good?” feels like a big, hard problem. How do we evaluate “good” for each individual viewer? “Who is that actor?” feels much easier. Should we always prioritize easy over hard? If so, when do we ever get to the hard problems that have the potential to differentiate us from our competitors and really drive our outcomes?

It’s hard to answer these questions when prioritizing opportunities of different shapes and sizes against each other. The opportunity space is too complex to manage as a flat list. Let’s turn to a better alternative.

The Power of Trees

Instead of managing an opportunity backlog, we’ll use an opportunity solution tree (introduced in Chapter 2) to help us map out and understand the opportunity space. The tree structure will help us visualize and understand the complexity of the opportunity space.

Trees depict two key relationships—parent-child relationships and sibling relationships. Both will help us make sense of the messy opportunity space. The parent-child relationship will be used to represent subsets—a child opportunity (or sub-opportunity) is a subset of a parent opportunity. For example, in the previous section, we saw that “I’m out of episodes of my favorite show” was one reason—but not the only reason—for “I can’t find anything to watch.” Referring to the tree relationships, we would say that “I can’t find anything to watch” is the parent of the child “I’m out of episodes of my favorite shows.”

We might then ask, “What are some other reasons our customers say, ‘I can’t find anything to watch’?” We might add, “I can’t figure out how to search for a specific show” and “The show I was watching is no longer available” as siblings to “I’m out of episodes of my favorite shows.” Siblings should be similar to each other—in that they are each a subset of the same parent—but distinct in that you can address one without addressing another. For example, we can address “I can’t figure out how to search for a specific show” without addressing “I’m out of episodes of my favorite shows.” But by addressing “I can’t figure out how to search for a specific show,” we partially address “I can’t find anything to watch.”

Sibling relationships help us make sense of similar opportunities like “I want to watch my shows on my flight” and “I want to watch my shows on my train commute.” We can easily depict both on our tree under the parent opportunity “I want to watch my shows on the go.” This allows us to treat each context (e.g., plane, train) as a specific need to address, while also visualizing the similarities. They are both sub-opportunities of the same parent.

When we learn to think in the structure of trees, it helps us deconstruct large, intractable problems into a series of smaller, more solvable problems. For example, “Is this show any good?” might, on the surface, look like a challenging problem to solve. But as we dig in and learn more, we realize that different people solve this problem in different ways. Some people choose what to watch based on the type of show (e.g., they like dramas or crime shows). Others choose shows based on who is in it—they have favorite actors—and they use the cast list as their primary selection factor. The more we learn about how people evaluate shows today, the more likely we can turn a big, intractable problem like “Is this show any good?” into a series of more solvable problems: “What type of show is this?” “Who is in this show?” “Is this show similar to another show I’ve watched?” “Who else is watching this show?” and so on. The big, intractable problem of “Is this show any good?” is a parent opportunity, while the rest are its sub-opportunities (or children).

The value of breaking big opportunities into a series of smaller opportunities is twofold. First, it allows us to tackle problems that otherwise might seem unsolvable. And second, it allows us to deliver value over time. That second benefit is at the heart of the Agile manifesto and is a key tenet of continuous improvement. Rather than waiting until we can solve the bigger problem—“Is this show any good?”—we can deliver value iteratively over time. We might start by solving the smaller problem of “Who is in this show?” because it’s fairly easy to solve and because we know a large percentage of our audience chooses shows according to this criterion. This allows us to ship value quickly. Now it might not solve the bigger opportunity completely, but it does solve a smaller need completely. Once we have accomplished that, we can move on to the next small opportunity. Over time, as we continuously ship value, we’ll chip away at the larger opportunity. Eventually, we’ll have solved enough of the smaller opportunities that we will, in turn, have solved the larger opportunity.

Additionally, the tree structure is going to be invaluable when it comes time to assessing and prioritizing opportunities. Our goal is to work on the most impactful opportunity, but we can’t assess every opportunity we come across. We’d spend weeks assessing the opportunity space instead of shipping value to our customers. Instead, we’ll use the tree structure to help us make fast decisions. We’ll learn more about that in the next chapter.

For now, know that, while structuring the opportunity space is hard work, the effort will be paid back with hefty rewards.

Identifying Distinct Branches

To unlock the power of deconstructing big, intractable challenges into a series of more solvable, smaller opportunities, we need a well-structured opportunity space. A key concept that drives this structure is the idea of distinctness. We need each opportunity to be distinct from every other opportunity. If there’s overlap, then we can’t work on one at a time. Instead, they all get enmeshed with each other, and we need to work on all of them at the same time. If this is how you are feeling, it’s a good sign that your tree needs more structure.

Working with product teams, I’ve identified two ways to uncover the underlying structure of your opportunity space. The first is to use the steps of your experience map that you created in Chapter 4. The second is to use your interview drawings to identify key moments in time. Both strategies accomplish the same goal—they help you organize the opportunity space by distinct moments so that there is no overlap from one branch to the next. We’ll dive into both options in more detail here.

In Chapter 4, you learned how to visualize what you already know about your customers’ experience. The output of this exercise was an experience map that showcases what your customers do to address their needs today. You learned that the map can help direct the stories that you collect in your interviews. It can also help give structure to the opportunity space. Our goal is to identify distinct moments in time during your customers’ experience. Oftentimes this is as simple as mapping each node in your experience map to the top level of opportunities on your opportunity solution tree.

However, if your team isn’t starting from a strong understanding of the customer experience, your map may not have distinct moments in time. It needs to evolve before you can identify them. Another approach to uncovering these distinct moments is to analyze the customer stories you are collecting in your interviews. In Chapter 5, I encouraged you to draw the stories that you heard. You do this by identifying the key moments in time that occurred during each story. If you take all of these drawings and start to label each key moment (or node), you’ll notice patterns across your unique stories. What nodes are showing up in story after story? How can you stitch the most common nodes together to create an experience map that represents the set of stories that you are collecting? You can then map these nodes to your top-level opportunities.

With either strategy, the key is to make sure there is no overlap between the moments in time. Overlap will prevent us from working on one opportunity at a time. If we continue with our streaming-entertainment case study, we might identify the following distinct moments based on our experience map from Chapter 4:

- Deciding to watch something
- Choosing something to watch
- Watching something
- The end of the watching experience

From these distinct moments in time, we could then create the following top-level opportunities:

Take an Inventory of the Opportunity Space

With your distinct branches in place, we now want to take an inventory of the opportunities you have heard in your customer interviews. If you’ve been creating interview snapshots for each interview (as recommended in Chapter 5), you can simply review each interview snapshot. However, you don’t want to add every opportunity to your tree. Instead, for each opportunity, ask the following questions:

- Is this opportunity framed as a customer need, pain point, or desire and not a solution?
- Is this opportunity unique to this customer, or have we seen it in more than one interview?
- If we address this opportunity, will it drive our desired outcome?

If the answer to all three of these questions is “Yes,” you’ll want to add it to your opportunity solution tree. For now, simply group it under the branch in which it occurs. If it seems like it could live under more than one branch, reframe the opportunity to be more specific. You may even need to split it into multiple opportunities, one for each moment in which it occurs, so that each can be grouped under their respective branches.

For example, “The interface is hard to use” is way too broad of an opportunity. We could boil the ocean trying to address every usability issue in our product. Instead, we want to get more specific. Where did this pain point show up in your customer’s story? This may turn into several opportunities: “I can’t figure out how to find a specific show that I have in mind,” “I don’t like entering a show name using the remote,” or “I can’t remember what episode I watched last.” Each of these are more specific. They are easier problems to solve, and they now each live in only one spot on the tree.

Add Structure to Each Branch

Now that you’ve collected the relevant opportunities, it’s time to add structure to each branch. Work with one branch at a time. Start by grouping similar opportunities together. Similar opportunities might be siblings, like we saw with “I want to watch my shows on a plane” and “I want to watch my shows on my train commute.” Or they might turn out to be the same opportunity worded slightly differently. For example, “I don’t like entering a show title with my remote control” and “Selecting letters with the keypad is hard.”

If your similar opportunities are siblings, look for a parent opportunity. In our train/plane example, we identified, “I want to watch my shows on the go” as the parent opportunity. This might have been explicitly mentioned in an interview, in which case, it will already be in our branch. But if it wasn’t, it’s fine to go ahead and add it, as it’s implied by the other two opportunities. So, don’t fret if you need to add parent opportunities that weren’t explicitly stated in an interview.

If your similar opportunities are really the same, like we saw with the two opportunities about entering a show title with a remote, simply combine them into one opportunity. In this case, we might merge them into “Entering a show name into the search box is hard.”

As you start to group siblings together and identify parent opportunities, you’ll end up with a set of mini-trees. Look for sibling relationships between the parents of those mini-trees. Which can you group together? If you need to, add a shared parent to cluster similar opportunities together. Keep iterating through these steps until you’ve identified a set of siblings that ladder up to the top opportunity (i.e., the one that reflects a key moment) from which all other opportunities descend.

Then repeat the whole process for the remaining branches in your tree.

Just Enough Structure

One of the biggest challenges with opportunity mapping is that it looks deceptively simple. However, it does require quite a bit of critical thinking. You’ll want to examine each opportunity to ensure it is properly framed, that you know what it means, and that it has the potential to drive your desired outcome. If you do your first tree in 30 minutes and think you are done, you are probably not thinking hard enough. However, I also see teams make the opposite mistake. They churn for hours trying to create the perfect tree. We don’t want to do that, either.

The key is to find the sweet spot between giving you enough structure to see the big picture, but not so much that you are overwhelmed with detail. Unfortunately, it will take some experience to get this right, as it’s a “You’ll know it when you see it” type of situation.

But here’s what I’ll leave you with as you embark on mapping your first opportunity space. This isn’t a one-and-done exercise. As Barbara Tversky says in the opening quote, “Structure is done, undone, and redone.” You should be revisiting your opportunity solution tree often. You’ll continue to reframe opportunities as you learn more about what they really mean. Seemingly simple opportunities will subdivide into myriad sub-opportunities as you start exploring them in your interviews. This is normal. You don’t have to do all of this work in your first draft. Do just enough to capture what you currently know, and trust that it will continue to grow and evolve over time.

Avoid Common Anti-Patterns

After you’ve created your first draft, keep an eye out for these common anti-patterns.

Opportunities framed from your company’s perspective. Product teams think about their product and business all day every day. It’s easy to get stuck thinking from your company’s perspective rather than your customers’ perspective. However, if we want to be truly human-centered, solving customer needs while creating value for the business, we need to frame opportunities from our customers’ perspective. No customer would ever say, “I wish I had more streaming-entertainment subscriptions.” But they might say, “I want access to more compelling content.” Review each opportunity on your tree and ask, “Have we heard this in interviews?” If you had to add opportunities to support the structure of your tree, you might ask, “Can I imagine a customer saying this?” Or are we just wishing a customer would say this?

Vertical opportunities. Vertical opportunities are when we have a parent with one child, who, in turn, has only one child, resulting in a vertical stack of single opportunities. Vertical opportunities tend to arise in two situations. One: You hear similar opportunities from several interviews, and each opportunity is really saying the same thing in different words. In this case, simply reframe one opportunity to encompass the broader need, and remove the rest. Otherwise, you’re missing sibling opportunities. If each sub-opportunity only partially solves the parent, then identify which sibling opportunities are missing, and fill them in. If you aren’t sure what the missing opportunities are, explore the parent opportunity in your upcoming interviews.

Opportunities have multiple parent opportunities. If your top-level opportunities represent distinct moments in time, then no opportunity should have two parents. If you are finding that an opportunity should ladder up to more than one parent, it’s framed too broadly. Get more specific. Define one opportunity for each moment in time in which that need, pain point, or desire occurs.

Opportunities are not specific. Opportunities that represent themes, design guidelines, or even sentiment, aren’t specific enough. “I wish this was easy to use,” “This is too hard,” and “I want to do everything on the go” are not good opportunities. However, if we make them more specific, they can become good opportunities: “I wish finding a show to watch was easier,” “Entering a movie title using the remote is hard,” and “I want to watch shows on my train commute” are great opportunities.

Opportunities are solutions in disguise. Often in an interview, your customer will ask for solutions. Sometimes they will even sound like opportunities. For example, you might hear a customer say, “I wish I could fast-forward through commercials.” You might be tempted to capture this as an opportunity. However, this is really a solution request. The easiest way to distinguish between an opportunity and a solution is to ask, “Is there more than one way to address this opportunity?” In this example, the only way to allow people to fast-forward through commercials is to offer a fast-forward solution. This isn’t an opportunity at all. Instead, we want to uncover the implied opportunity. Maybe it’s as simple as, “I don’t like commercials.” Why does this reframing help? If we then ask, “How might we address ‘I don’t like commercials’?” we can generate several options. We can create more entertaining commercials—like those we see during the Super Bowl. We can allow you to fast-forward through commercials like the customer suggested. Or we can offer a commercial-free subscription. An opportunity should have more than one potential solution. Otherwise, it’s simply a solution in disguise.

Capturing feelings as opportunities. When a customer expresses emotion in an interview, it’s usually a strong signal that an opportunity is lurking nearby. However, don’t capture the feeling itself as the opportunity. Instead, look for the cause of the feeling. When we capture opportunities like “I’m frustrated” or “I’m overwhelmed,” we limit how we can help. We can’t fix feelings. But if we capture the cause of those feelings—“I hate typing in my password every time I purchase a show” or “I’m way behind on this show”—we can often identify solutions that address the underlying cause. So, do note when a customer expresses a feeling, but consider it a signpost, and remember to let it direct you to the underlying opportunity.
