Can you take a minute to help other product people?

Reading a book takes time. Many people decide whether a book is worth the investment by reading reviews. Would you mind taking a few minutes to review this book on Amazon or your favorite book site? Your opinion can make a difference. I would greatly appreciate it, and I know other product folks would as well.

As a thank-you, I have collected my list of recommended books here: amazon.com/shop/ttorres
