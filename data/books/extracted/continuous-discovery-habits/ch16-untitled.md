CHAPTER EIGHT

SUPERCHARGED IDEATION

“Creative teams know that quantity is the best predictor of quality.”

— Leigh Thompson, Making the Team

“You’ll never stumble upon the unexpected if you stick only to the familiar.”

— Ed Catmull, Creativity, Inc.

You’ve identified a clear customer need, pain point, or desire—your target opportunity—and it’s finally time to jump into the solution space. Where do you start? For many, the answer is brainstorming. Now, odds are you just had one of two reactions when you read that. Either you conjured an image of a lively group standing before a wall of multi-colored stickies, laughing, sharing ideas, essentially having fun. Or you conjured an image of a windowless conference room with a few people shouting out ideas and one person scribing at the whiteboard while everyone else looks bored.

At some companies, brainstorming is defined as the be-all-end-all, the panacea from which all good ideas emerge. For others, it’s the epitome of a Dilbert comic—a complete waste of everyone’s time. In the first case, participants argue it’s the most effective tool in their toolbox and is responsible for all of their creative success. In the second case, participants are skeptical that any good could come of this exercise. What’s going on here? Why is brainstorming so polarizing? Does it work? Why or why not? In this chapter, we’ll tackle all of these questions and much more.

Quantity Leads to Quality

For many of us, brainstorming seems unnecessary. We hear about a customer problem or need, and our brain immediately jumps to a solution. It’s human nature. We are good at closing the loop—we hear about a problem, and our brain wants to solve it. However, creativity research tells us that our first idea is rarely our best idea. Researchers measure creativity using three primary criteria: fluency (the number of ideas we generate), flexibility (how diverse the ideas are), and originality (how novel an idea is).35

Similar research shows that fluency is correlated with both flexibility and originality.36 In other words, as we generate more ideas, the diversity and novelty of those ideas increases. Additionally, the most original ideas tend to be generated toward the end of the ideation session.37 They weren’t the first ideas we came up with. So even though our brain is very good at generating fast solutions, we want to learn to keep the loop open longer. We want to learn to push beyond our first mediocre and obvious ideas, and delve into the realm of more diverse, original ideas.

Most product teams are inundated with too many ideas. We have endless backlogs, countless customer requests, and a never-ending roadmap. The problem, however, is that many of these ideas are first ideas to a variety of customer opportunities.

If we took the time to map each item in our backlog, each customer request, and each initiative on our roadmap to the opportunities on our opportunity solution tree (see Chapters 2 and 6), odds are we’ll have only one or two solutions for each opportunity. Even though we are inundated with ideas, we aren’t pushing past our first or second mediocre ideas to get to the realm of diverse and original ideas.

Now, not all opportunities need an innovative solution. You don’t need to reinvent the “forgot password” workflow (but you should still test it—more on that in Chapter 11). But for the strategic opportunities where you want to differentiate from your competitors, you’ll want to take the time to generate several ideas to ensure that you uncover the best ones.

Okay, so let’s get everyone in a room to brainstorm so that we can find those more diverse and original ideas, right? Not quite. We first need to discuss the challenges with brainstorming.

The Problem With Brainstorming

Brainstorming was introduced and popularized by Alex Osborn, an executive at a respected advertising firm, in his 1953 book Applied Imagination. He believed brainstorming was the lynchpin underlying creativity and wanted to share his company’s process with the world. To help put this book into context, it’s similar to what we see today with Ed Catmull’s book Creativity, Inc. about Pixar’s creative process or Tom Kelley’s The Art of Innovation about how the leading design firm IDEO works. Like Pixar and IDEO today, people admired Osborn’s creative success, and brainstorming spread quickly.

Osborn outlined four rules for brainstorming. One, focus on quantity. In other words, generate as many ideas as you can. Two, defer judgment, and separate idea generation from idea evaluation. Three, welcome unusual ideas. And four, combine and improve ideas. He suggested that groups come together real-time, face-to-face (remember he predated the digital, asynchronous communication tools we have today), to generate ideas together, using these four rules. For those of you who have participated in brainstorming sessions, these rules aren’t new. They are still in common use today.

As brainstorming rose in popularity, academic researchers started to question if it worked. Was brainstorming in groups the most effective way to generate ideas? For decades researchers ran studies in which they compared the creative output of brainstorming groups against the creative output of the same number of individuals generating ideas alone. Study after study found that the individuals generating ideas alone outperformed the brainstorming groups. Individuals generated more ideas, more diverse ideas, and more original ideas.38

As researchers dug into why individuals outperformed groups, they identified four mitigating factors. First, research has found that people tend to work harder when working individually than when working in groups. This is called social loafing. When we are on our own, we have no choice but to put in the work, whereas when we are in a group, we can rely on the efforts of others.

Second, brainstorming groups exhibited many of the common challenges associated with group conformity. The early ideas set the tone for later ideas. Ideas were often too conservative or similar to each other. Members censored their ideas due to concerns about how others would judge their ideas.

Third, brainstorming groups ran into challenges with production blocking—that’s a fancy term for a simple idea. Have you ever been about to say something when someone else jumped in, prompting you to forget what you were going to say? That’s production blocking. In group brainstorming sessions, people lose ideas amid the chaos of everyone sharing ideas in rapid succession.

And finally, the fourth factor is a common group trait known as downward norm setting—the performance of the group tends to be limited to the lowest-performing member. Rather than the strongest member raising everyone else up, the opposite happens. The weakest member brings everyone else down. These factors combined to inhibit the performance of the brainstorming groups as compared to the individuals who generated ideas alone.39

This raises the question: Why are brainstorming advocates so adamant that brainstorming works? It turns out researchers have an answer to this question as well. Bernard Nijstad and colleagues at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands found that brainstorming groups are subject to what they call “the illusion of group productivity.”40 This is a phenomenon in which groups overestimate their performance. They also report high levels of satisfaction with their work despite their lesser performance.

Nijstad and colleagues attribute this overestimation to a reduction in cognitive failures. They define a “cognitive failure” as occurring when a participant can’t generate any ideas. When you are brainstorming alone, you generate more cognitive failures than when you are brainstorming in a group. Ideas from the group help other group members get unstuck.

But even with this group advantage, individuals generating ideas alone still generated more ideas, more diverse ideas, and more original ideas than brainstorming groups. The individuals simply had to work harder to get there. However, since the brainstorming groups spent less time stuck, their perception was that their performance was higher. This illusion of group productivity may explain why so many brainstorming advocates consider it a panacea.

So, if we stick to what the research tells us, individuals generating ideas on their own do outperform brainstorming groups. Even if we think brainstorming is effective, we are probably falling prey to the illusion of group productivity. Working in a group feels easier, so we think we must be performing at a higher level. Now, if you are wondering if there is a way to get the benefit of reducing cognitive failures that we see in groups with the creative output of individuals brainstorming on their own, it turns out there is.

Runa Korde and Paul Paulus, researchers at the University of Texas-Arlington, ran a series of studies that showed alternating between individual ideation and group sharing of ideas can improve the quality of ideas generated in subsequent individual ideation sessions.41 Exposure to other people’s ideas did inspire new ideas.

The key difference here is that individuals still generated ideas on their own. Participants started by ideating on their own. Then they shared their ideas with the group. Then they went back to ideating on their own. They never ideated as a group, but they received the benefit of hearing each other’s ideas. You’ll see in the methods described below that we’ll be putting this same pattern into practice.

Getting Unstuck

When generating ideas on your own, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll get stuck. Generating ideas is hard work and takes effort. The first thing to recognize when you get stuck is that it happens to everyone. You aren’t bad at generating ideas. You are creative.

Many of us have self-limiting beliefs around creativity. We believe because we can’t draw, paint, or play a musical instrument, we must not be creative. I’m here to tell you, you are. Creativity is a universal human trait. And as a product-team member, there is no one better than you to generate creative solutions to your customers’ problems. If it’s been a while since you’ve generated ideas, it might be slow to start. That’s normal. Push through the discomfort and keep thinking. The following tips will help.

First, don’t try to spend an hour generating ideas. Take frequent breaks. Spread it out throughout your day. Try to generate ideas in the few minutes you have between meetings. After lunch, go for a walk, and daydream about what you might build. A change of scenery can often inspire new ideas. Try generating ideas at different times of the day. Some of us will be better first thing in the morning, when we have a lot of mental energy; others might find the late afternoon to be the optimal idea-generation time. Experiment. Find what works best for you.

In addition to ideating at different times and in different places, take advantage of incubation.42 Incubation occurs when your brain continues to consider a problem even after you’ve stopped consciously thinking about it. You’ve probably experienced this often in your life. After working on what seems like an unsolvable challenge all day, you finally go home and take a break. After a good night’s sleep, you come to work, returning to the problem. Instantly, you identify a solution. In fact, it’s hard to imagine why it seemed like such a hard problem yesterday. That’s incubation. And it works. Incubation can be particularly helpful after hearing other people’s ideas. You may not think of new ideas right away, but odds are, your brain is still working on it in the background. So, if you get stuck, sleep on it. Tomorrow will likely bring fresh ideas.

Another common way of getting unstuck is to look to analogous products for inspiration. For many product teams, this means competitive research. You should draw inspiration from your competitors, but look broader than that. Many innovative ideas come from unrelated domains. For example, Velcro was invented after the inventor found a cocklebur in his sock. He was intrigued by how the latching mechanism worked, and it inspired the design of Velcro.

When you get stuck, start with your competition. But then look wider. Ask yourself: What other industries have solved similar problems? They don’t need to be similar or even be in an adjacent industry. You are looking for similarities in the target opportunity. For example, if you work for a job board and you are helping recruiters evaluate job candidates, you can look at other job boards, but you can also look at how online shopping sites help shoppers evaluate products, you can look at how travel aggregators help travelers choose hotels, and you can look at how insurance companies present different policies. These industries are unrelated to each other, but they are each solving analogous problems.

Additionally, when you are stuck, you can start to consider what your extreme users might need. What would a power user want? What does the first-time user need? What about people with different disabilities? How about people who live in remote locations or bustling cities? Young people? Senior citizens? Your extreme users will vary by product, but thinking about the needs of different types of users as they relate to your target opportunity can help you generate more ideas that may work for everyone.

And finally, don’t be afraid to consider wild ideas. Some people don’t like this suggestion, because wild ideas are rarely pursued. But wild ideas can improve more feasible ideas. This is where the power of mixing and matching different solutions to identify even-better ideas comes into play. So, when ideating, pretend you have a magic wand—anything is possible.

Putting It All Into Practice

Enough theory. Let’s put some of these ideas into practice.

1. Review your target opportunity. Make sure that everyone on your team knows what it means and is familiar with the necessary context. Make sure it’s distinct from the other opportunities that you’ve discussed and that it’s an appropriately sized leaf-node opportunity. If you need to revisit any of these concepts, review the prior chapter before continuing.

2. Generate ideas alone. Take some time to jot down as many ideas as you can. When you get stuck, take a break, and come back to it. If you are still stuck, try to find inspiration from your competitors and analogous products. For analogous products, think broadly. You aren’t limited to just the other players in your space.

3. Share ideas across your team. You can do this in a face-to-face, real-time meeting, or you can do it asynchronously in a digital chat channel (e.g., Slack or Microsoft Teams). The key is to take the time to describe each of your ideas, allow people to ask questions, and to riff on the ideas.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3. Remember, the benefit of sharing your ideas is that hearing other people’s ideas will inspire even more ideas. So, don’t skip repeating step 2 to ensure that you reap the rewards. Repeat until you’ve generated between 15 and 20 ideas for your target opportunity. Remember, research shows that your first ideas are rarely your best ideas. The goal is to push your creative output to find the more diverse and more original ideas.

Evaluating Your Ideas

Once you’ve generated 15 to 20 ideas for the same target opportunity, it’s time to start evaluating your ideas. First, start by asking for each, “Does this idea solve the target opportunity?” It’s okay if it’s only a partial solution, but you’ll be surprised to find several ideas that don’t solve your target opportunity at all. Don’t worry—this is a natural side effect of idea generation. But now is the time to weed them out.

Next, you’ll “dot-vote”43 as a team to whittle your set down from lots of ideas to three ideas. Dot voting is a simple method that facilitates group evaluation. Research shows that while we are better at generating ideas individually, we are better at evaluating ideas as a group.44 To dot-vote, allot three votes per member. As you vote, the only criteria you should be considering is how well the idea addresses the target opportunity. You aren’t voting for the coolest, shiniest ideas. Nor are you ruling out the hardest or even impossible ideas. We’ll deal with that down the road. Each person can assign their votes however they please. They can place all three votes on one idea or vote for three ideas individually. Once everyone has placed their votes, you’ll select the top three ideas that garnered the most votes.

It may take a few rounds of dot-voting to get to your top three. For example, if after round one of voting, several ideas have one or two votes, but no ideas have three or more votes, take some time to discuss your votes. Don’t let this turn into a long debate or argument. Instead, let each person pitch the ideas they voted for. During your pitch, be sure to highlight why each idea best addresses the target opportunity. Then vote again.

Coming out of any voting round, if there’s a clear winner, set it aside as one of your three to move forward with. Continue dot-voting until you have set aside three ideas. It’s important after you are done dot-voting to take a quick poll and make sure everyone on the team is excited about the set you are moving forward with. This doesn’t mean you have to have consensus on all three options. But everyone on the team should be excited about at least one idea, and each idea should have a strong advocate in the group. If that’s not the case, revisit your set of ideas, and dot-vote again.

Dot-voting is a great way to go from lots of ideas down to some ideas. Groups tend to evaluate ideas better than individuals because groups have a wider breadth of experience to draw on. However, we don’t want to dot-vote to select one idea. You’ll see in the coming chapters that we will use prototyping and assumption testing to whittle our set down from three to one. Our goal for now is to set up a good compare-and-contrast decision: Which of these three ideas best delivers on our target opportunity? You’ll learn how to answer that question with the next couple of habits.

Avoid These Common Anti-Patterns

As you generate ideas, be sure to avoid these common anti-patterns:

Not including diverse perspectives. Most of the exercises in this book are designed for product trios to do together. However, ideation is best done with the entire team. You want to make sure everyone has a chance to contribute their ideas. You also might consider inviting key stakeholders who bring a different perspective. The more diversity in the group, the more diverse ideas you’ll generate. However, make sure that you set the context for ideation by sharing your target opportunity and the customer context in which that opportunity occurs.

Generating too many variations of the same idea. When we get stuck generating ideas, we tend to riff on variations of the same idea. If we try to list as many types of animals as possible, once we identify lions and tigers, we might add pumas, cheetahs, and snow leopards. This can be a good tactic for increasing the number of ideas that you generate. However, when selecting three to be in your consideration set, you want as much diversity as possible. So, this can’t be the only way that you generate ideas. Instead, deliberately work to identify categorically different ideas. If you get stuck, look for inspiration from analogous products. Analogous products don’t need to be from your industry. In fact, the further away they are from your industry, the more likely you’ll uncover diverse ideas. So, ask, “Who else has to solve a problem like this?” and then investigate how they solve it.

Limiting ideation to one session. Hosting a brainstorming meeting is a common business norm. We expect to generate ideas in one sitting. But research on generating ideas shows this isn’t the most effective tactic. Instead, give ideation the time it deserves. Let your ideators consider ideas over time. Take advantage of the brain’s innate ability to incubate a problem.

Selecting ideas that don’t address the target opportunity. When ideating, you want to encourage your participants to defer judgment. As a result, it’s not uncommon to end up with solutions that don’t address your target opportunity. Before dot-voting, remove any ideas that don’t address your target opportunity. Otherwise, it can be easy to get distracted by a shiny idea that might be a good idea for some day in the future but isn’t a good idea right now. In the previous chapter, you made a strategic decision when you chose a target opportunity. Don’t undo that work now.
