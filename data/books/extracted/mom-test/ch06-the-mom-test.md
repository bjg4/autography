## **Passing the mom test**

```
    Son:
```

“Hey mom, how’s that new iPad treating you?”

```
    Mom:
```

“Oh - I love it! I use it every day.”

```
    Son:
```

“What do you usually do on it?” Whoops — we asked a

generic question, so answer to this probably won’t be terribly
valuable.

```
    Mom:
```

“Oh, you know. Read the news, play sudoku, catch up with

my friends. The usual.”

```
    Son:
```

“What’s the last thing you did on it?” Get specific about

examples in the past to get real, concrete data.

```
    Mom:
```

“You know your father and I are planning that trip? I was

figuring out where we could stay. “ She uses it for both
entertainment and utility, which didn’t come up during the
“usually” answer.

```
    Son:
```

“Did you use an app for that?” A slightly leading question,

but sometimes we need to nudge to get to the topic we’re


10


interested in.

```
Mom:
```

“No, I just used Google. I didn’t know there was an app.

What’s it called?” Younger folks use the App Store as a search
engine, whereas your mom waits for a specific
recommendation. If that’s true more broadly, finding a reliable
marketing channel outside the App Store is going to be crucial.

```
Son:
```

“Where did you find out about the other ones you use?” Dig

into interesting and unexpected answers to understand the
behaviours and motivations behind them.

```
Mom:
```

“The Sunday paper has a section on the apps of the week.”

You can’t remember the last time you cracked open a paper, but
it sounds like traditional PR might be a viable option for
reaching customers like your mom.

```
Son:
```

“Makes sense. Hey, by the way, I saw a couple new

cookbooks on the shelf — where did those come from?”
Business ideas usually have several failure points. Here it’s
both the medium of an iPad app and the content of a cookbook.

```
Mom:
```

“They’re one of those things you just end up getting at

Christmas. I think Marcy gave me that one. Haven’t even
opened it. As if I need another lasagna recipe at my age!” Aha!
This answer is gold dust for 3 reasons: 1. Old people don’t
need another generic set of recipes. 2. The gift market may be
strong . 3. Younger cooks may be a better customer segment
since they don’t yet know the basics.

```
Son:
```

“What’s the last cookbook you did buy for yourself?” Attack

generic answers like “I don’t buy cookbooks” by asking for
specific examples.

```
Mom:
```

“Now that you mention it, I bought a vegan cookbook about 3

months ago. Your father is trying to eat healthier and thought my
veggies could benefit from a pinch more zazz.” More gold:
experienced chefs may still buy specialised or niche
cookbooks.

The conversation continues. If it’s going well, I would raise the topics of
whether she ever thought to look for recipes on the iPad or for cooking
videos on YouTube.


Overall, your mom can’t remember the last time she had such an enjoyable
conversation with you. You were so interested in her life for once! You
thank her for the lasagna, pet the dog, and head home. You’ve learned that
building an app and waiting for people to find it on the App Store probably
isn’t a good plan. But you’ve got some good insight about your customer
segment and a few promising leads to look into. That was a useful
conversation.

## **A useful conversation**


The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it
gives us concrete facts about our customers' lives and world views. These
facts, in turn, allow us to improve our business.


Our original idea looked like this: old people like cookbooks and iPads.
Therefore, we will build a cookbook for the iPad. It’s generic. There are a
thousand possible variations of this premise.


With an idea this vague, we can’t answer any of the difficult questions like
which recipes to include or how people will hear about it. Until we get
specific, it always seems like a good idea.


After just one conversation (with our mom, of all people), we have a higher
fidelity vision. We now see that there are at least 2 specific customer
segments we might serve, each of which needs a slightly different product.
We’ve also identified some major risks to address before we commit too
heavily.


1. We could offer niche recipes (ethnic, diets) which experienced cooks

may not already know. Our biggest question is how to reach them when
they don’t search for apps. We have a possible lead with newspaper
and magazine PR.
2. Alternately, we might make generic recipes for younger cooks who are

easier to reach via the App Store and who haven’t memorised all their


12


favourites yet. We haven’t talked to any, so we have loads of questions,
but one big one is whether a customer segment who isn’t already in the
habit of buying expensive cookbooks will pay a premium for ours.


The first conversation gave us rope to hang ourselves. The second gave us
actionable insight. Why? What was different about the second conversation?


Mom was unable to lie to us because we never talked about our idea.


That’s kind of weird, right? We find out if people care about what we’re
doing by never mentioning it. Instead, we talk about them and their lives.


The point is a bit more subtle than this. Eventually you do need to mention
what you’re building and take people’s money for it. However, the big
mistake is almost always to mention your idea too soon rather than too late.


If you just avoid mentioning your idea, you automatically start asking better
questions. Doing this is the easiest (and biggest) improvement you can make
to your customer conversations.


Here are 3 simple rules to help you. They are collectively called (drumroll)
The Mom Test:


**The Mom Test:**


1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about
the future

3. Talk less and listen more


It’s called The Mom Test because it leads to questions that even your mom
can’t lie to you about. When you do it right, they won’t even know you have
an idea. There are some other important tools and tricks that we’ll introduce
throughout the rest of the book. But first, let’s let’s put The Mom Test to
work on some questions.


Rule of thumb: Customer conversations are bad by default. It’s your job to


13


fix them.
