## **How long are meetings?**

Early conversations are very fast. The chats grow longer as you move from
the early broad questions (“Is this a real problem?”) toward more specific
product and industry issues (“Which other software do we have to integrate
with to close the sale?”).


It only takes 5 minutes to learn whether a problem exists and is important.
Learning how someone currently achieves a certain goal or solves a
problem is also quick.


Soon you’ll find yourself asking questions which are answered with long
stories explaining their workflow, how they spend their time, or what else
they’ve tried. You can usually get what you came for in 10-15 minutes, but
people love telling stories about themselves, so you can keep this
conversation going indefinitely if it’s valuable for you and interesting for
them.


At the longer extreme, learning the details of an industry takes an hour or
more. Thankfully, those are easier conversations to manage since the other
person (usually some sort of industry expert) can go into a monologue once
you point them in the right direction.


The duration of formal B2B meetings (the kind you schedule) is determined
more by the arbitrary calendar block than by what you actually want to
learn. Of course, you've liable to burn 15 minutes just to get a cup of tea and
say hello.


Once you have a product and the meetings take on a more sales-oriented
feel, you’ll want to start carving out clear blocks of 30+ minutes. You might
lose 5 minutes due to miscellaneous tardiness, spend 5 minutes saying hello,
5 minutes asking questions to understand their goals/problems/budget, 10
minutes to show/describe the product, and the last 5 minutes figuring out
next steps and advancement. That's your half hour.


The potential speed of the early conversations one of the big reasons I like
keeping it casual and skipping the meeting. Scheduling and going to a
meeting has a lot of overhead for a 10 minute chat. Even explaining that
you’re starting a company and would love to ask a couple questions can take

5 or 10 minutes. You'll make progress a lot faster if you’re able to leave
your idea out of it for as long as possible.

## **Putting it together**


Even within a more formal meeting, you still might want to keep it casual if
you’re hoping to get non-biased feedback.


I once had a product idea to help busy investors to manage their dealflow. I
knew they got hundreds of applications per month and figured it must be a
spreadsheet nightmare. I lined up a couple meetings to ask about the
industry. I showed up to the first meeting and, while making smalltalk, said
something like “I was thinking, you guys must get a ton of leads, right?” The
guy laughed and said, yeah, it was crazy. “How in the world do you deal
with all of that?” He sort of shrugged and pointed at a cluster of about a
dozen sticky notes on the wall.


Each held a name and a phone number. “Our analysts kill most of them
before they ever reach us, and then we throw out a bunch more. We only end
up with about 10 apiece that are serious contenders. We just call every
couple weeks to see how it’s going.” Well that doesn’t sound so bad, I said.
“Yeah, it works pretty well,” he replied. “Anyway, what did you want to
talk about?”


They don’t have the problem. That’s successful learning. We disproved our
idea before the guy even realised we were talking about it. It took 5 minutes,
avoided biases, and didn’t feed us any bad data in the form of compliments,
fluff, or ideas. Instead, we got concrete facts about our customers which are
directly relevant to our core business questions.


Of course, it took me a 2-hour commute to get to those 5 minutes. It can’t be
perfect every time.


In the aforementioned case, we proved ourselves wrong. Sometimes,
however, it goes in the opposite direction and everything we learn from
customers makes us even more excited. In that case, we stand atop all that
we’ve learned and take the visionary leap of coming up with a specific
product and business to make our customers’ lives better. And then we ask
them to commit to it.


61


Rule of thumb: Give as little information as possible about your idea while
still nudging the discussion in a useful direction.

**CHAPTER FIVE**

# **Commitment and** **advancement**


Once we've learned the key facts about our industry and customers, it’s time
to zoom in again and start revealing our idea and showing some product.
The bad news is that this invites nefarious compliments. The good news is
that since we have the beginnings of a product, we're now in a position to
cut through the false positives by asking for commitments.


In sales, moving a sales relationship to the next stage is called
"advancement". It's like pushing a customer into the next step of your realworld acquisition funnel. They'll either move forward or make it clear that
they're not a customer. Both are good results for your learning.


When you fail to push for advancement, you end up with zombie leads:
potential customers (or investors) who keep taking meetings with you and
saying nice things, but who never seem to cut a check. It's like your startup
has been friend-zoned. Thankfully, you caused it, and that means you can fix
it. It's a consequence of being clingy and fearing rejection. By giving them a
clear chance to either commit or reject us, we get out of the friend-zone and
can identify the real leads.


As always, you’re not trying to convince every person to like what you’re
doing. When you’ve got the information you came for (even if it’s that they
don’t care), you can leave. But at some point, you do need to put them to a
decision in order to get it.


**Symptoms:**


63


A pipeline of zombie leads
Ending product meetings with a compliment
Ending product meetings with no clear next steps
Meetings which "went well"
They haven't given up anything of value


As I use them in a customer learning context, commitment and advancement
are separate concepts which overlap quite a lot and tend to appear together.


Commitment — They are showing they’re serious by giving up
something they value such as time, reputation, or money.
Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world
funnel and getting closer to a sale.


Commitment and advancement often arrive hand-in-hand. For example, to
move to the next step (advancement), you might need an introduction to your
contact’s boss (reputation commitment). As such, they are functionally
equivalent for our purposes and I’m going to blur them into one concept for
the following sections.


Rule of thumb: “Customers” who keep being friendly but aren’t ever going
to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals.

## **Meetings succeed or fail**


It took me years to learn that there’s no such thing as a meeting which just
"went well". Every meeting either succeeds or fails. You've lost the meeting
when you leave with a compliment or a stalling tactic. While we might spot
something as blatant as "Let's talk again after the holidays... Don't call me,
I'll call you," we accept the more subtle versions every day.


A meeting has succeeded when it ends with a commitment to advance to the
next step. But you have to force this resolution or the meetings drift along in
la-la-land while performing their ancient duty: wasting everyone’s time.


64


If you leave with worthless wishy washiness, I'd bet you're falling for one
or both of the following traps:


1. You're asking for their opinion about your idea (e.g. fishing for

compliments)
2. You're not asking for a clear commitment or next steps


You know how to deal with compliments by now: deflect, ignore, and get
back to business. Commitments are similarly easy to master, once we know
what we’re looking for. When we leave without a commitment, sometimes
it’s because we asked and got rejected. That’s sad, but it happens. Not
everyone is going to convert and at least you now know where you stand.
You have a strong negative data point.


The real failure is listed above as #2: not even asking. I never consider
rejection to be a real failure. But not asking certainly is. This can happen
because you avoid the scary question or because you haven’t figured out
what the next steps should be.


Commitment is important. It tells us whether people are actually telling the
truth. The more they give us, the more we can trust what they say.


Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales
meeting, the meeting was pointless.

## **The currencies of conversation**


Commitment can be cash, but doesn’t have to be. Think of it in terms of
currency—what are they giving up for you? A compliment costs them
nothing, so it’s worth nothing and carries no data. The major currencies are
time, reputation risk, and cash.


A time commitment could include:


Clear next meeting with known goals


65


Sitting down to give feedback on wireframes
Using a trial themselves for a non-trivial period


Reputation risk commitments might be:


Intro to peers or team
Intro to a decision maker (boss, spouse, lawyer)
Giving a public testimonial or case study


Financial commitments are easier to imagine and include:


Letter of intent (non-legal but gentlemanly agreement to purchase)
Pre-order
Deposit


Sometimes, strong commitments combine multiple currencies, such as
someone agreeing to run a paid trial with their whole team, thus risking their
time, money, and reputation.


Just like compliments aren’t data when you’re trying to learn about a
problem, they also aren’t progress when you’re trying to validate a product.
Hearing a compliment can still be useful though—it’s a warning flag that the
person you’re talking to is trying to get rid of you.


Rule of thumb: The more they’re giving up, the more seriously you can take
their kind words.

## **Good meeting / bad meeting**


Game time again. We just had a meeting. But how did it go? Were they good
meetings or bad meetings? Why? And if they’re bad, what can we do to fix
them?


Have a think about the meetings listed below and then turn the page for
further discussion.

“That’s so cool. I love it!”
“Looks great. Let me know when it launches.”
“There are a couple people I can intro you to when you’re ready.”
“What are the next steps?”
“I would definitely buy that.”
“When can we start the trial?”
“Can I buy the prototype?”
“When can you come back to talk to the rest of the team?”
