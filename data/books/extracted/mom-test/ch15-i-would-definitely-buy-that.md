#### "I would definitely buy that."

Bad meeting. Danger! There’s admittedly some signal here, but the false
positive danger is off the charts. This is the mis-interpreted answer which
sunk the first startup I worked at to the tune of ten million bucks.


To fix it, you need to shift from fuzzy future promises into concrete current
commitments. For example, you could ask for a letter of intent, a prepurchase or deposit, or intros to other decision makers and team members.
Kickstarter is so wonderful because it forces customers who say they would
buy it to actually pull out a credit card and commit.

#### "When can we start the trial?"


Maybe a good meeting. Unlike “when does it launch," which is usually a
stall, “When can we start” is a step forward. Setting up new software and
training staff to use it is a big deal for most businesses. Even a "free" trial
can cost them serious money. However, in some cases, "trying" software
costs nothing, especially for individuals. For example, I've “tried” countless
CRM (contact management) apps. It takes ten seconds to log in, look around,
and never think about it again.


As always, think in terms of currency. What are they giving up to try it out?
If your trial is too "cheap" to try, you can try to increase the cost of it. For
example, you could ask to write a case study about them after they've spent
2 weeks using it. Or you could get them to promise to try using it with their
team for at least a week. If you've got a more developed product, you can
take their credit card and just charge them nothing if they cancel within 30
days. The more they are giving up for you, the more seriously you can take
their validation.
