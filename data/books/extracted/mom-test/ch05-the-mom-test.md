## **Failing the mom test**

```
    Son:
```

“Mom, mom, I have an idea for a business — can I run it by

you?” I am about to expose my ego — please don’t hurt my
feelings.

```
    Mom:
```

“Of course, dear.” You are my only son and I am ready to lie

to protect you.

```
    Son:
```

“You like your iPad, right? You use it a lot?”

```
    Mom:
```

“Yes.” You led me to this answer, so here you go.

```
    Son:
```

“Okay, so would you ever buy an app which was like a

cookbook for your iPad?” I am optimistically asking a
hypothetical question and you know what I want you to say.

```
    Mom:
```

“Hmmm.” As if I need another cookbook at my age.

```
    Son:
```

“And it only costs $40 — that’s cheaper than those

hardcovers on your shelf.” I’m going to skip that lukewarm
signal and tell you more about my great idea.

```
    Mom:
```

“Well...” Aren’t apps supposed to cost a dollar?

```
    Son:
```

“And you can share recipes with your friends, and there’s an

iPhone app which is your shopping list. And videos of that
celebrity chef you love.” Please just say “yes.” I will not leave
you alone until you do.

```
    Mom:
```

“Oh, well yes honey, that sounds amazing. And you’re right,

$40 is a good deal. Will it have pictures of the recipes?” I have
rationalised the price outside of a real purchase decision, made
a non-committal compliment, and offered a feature request to
appear engaged.

```
    Son:
```

“Yes, definitely. Thanks mom — love you!” I have

completely mis-interpreted this conversation and taken it as
validation.

```
    Mom:
```

“Won’t you have some lasagna?” I am concerned that you

won’t be able to afford food soon. Please eat something.


Our misguided entrepreneur has a few more conversations like this,
becomes increasingly convinced he’s right, quits his job, and sinks his
savings into the app. Then he wonders why nobody (even his mom) buys the
app, especially since he had been so rigorous.


Doing it wrong is worse than doing nothing at all. When you know you’re
clueless, you tend to be careful. But collecting a fistful of false positives is
like convincing a drunk he’s sober: not an improvement.


Let’s fix the conversation and show that if we do it right, even mom can help
us figure out whether our business is a good idea.
