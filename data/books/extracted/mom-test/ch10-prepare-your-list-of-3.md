## **Prepare your list of 3**

Always pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn from any
given type of person.


Pre-planning your big questions makes it a lot easier to ask questions which
pass The Mom Test and aren’t biasing. It also makes it easier to face the
questions that hurt. If we go through an unplanned conversation, we tend to
focus on trivial stuff which keeps the conversation comfortable. Instead,
decide what to ask with your team in a calm environment.


Your 3 questions will be different for each type of person you’re talking to.
If you have multiple types of customers or partners, have a list for each.


Don’t stress too much about choosing the “right” important questions. They
will change. Just choose the 3 questions which seem murkiest or most
important right now. Doing so will give you firmer footing and a better
sense of direction for your next 3.


You might get answers 1-3 from customer A, answer 4 from customer B,
answers 5-7 from customer C. There’s overlap and repetition, but you don’t
need to repeat the full set of questions with every participant. Don’t feel
obliged to repeat questions you already have reliable data on. Pick up
where you left off and keep filling in the picture.


Knowing your list allows you to take better advantage of serendipitous
encounters. Instead of running into that dream customer and asking to
exchange business cards so you can “grab a coffee” (exactly like everyone
else), you can just pop off your most important question. And that goes a
long way toward Keeping it Casual.


Rule of thumb: You always need a list of your 3 big questions.
