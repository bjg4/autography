## **To commute or to call**

One of the solutions to the time cost of these conversations is to move them
onto Skype or phone calls. In most situations, I don’t think the added volume
is worth the information you lose by not being in the room. I get confused
enough by what people are telling me in person. Losing access to their face
and body language feels like shooting myself in the foot.


More subtly, calls damage the delicate power dynamic of these
conversations. When someone is having a coffee with you, there’s the
potential to chat as friends. You can just shoot the breeze about the industry
for a bit. You can keep it casual. They’re enjoying the conversation


The same is decidedly not true on the phone or Skype. People try to squeeze
calls in between other activities, wondering how quickly they can “finish
with business” and hang up. Folks on the phone are super annoyed when you
“just want to chat”. So you need to make the whole thing more formal,
which is one of the exact mistakes we’re trying to avoid!


Phone calls end up sounding more like scripted interviews than natural
conversations, because they are. It’s a constraint of the medium.


Plus, nobody becomes friends over the phone, which means you aren't going
to get the warm intros and future meetings you need. Setting up a call feels
like less overhead in the short-term, but that’s because you aren’t yet able to
see all the time-saving and business-saving benefits of in-person
relationships with your customers.


That being said, some other great people in the field like and recommend
phone calls. Use whatever works. But I will say that you should start in
person. It’s too easy to use surveys or phone calls as an excuse to skip the
awkwardness of meeting in person rather than as a considered trade-off.
