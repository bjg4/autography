# **Conclusion and** **cheatsheet**

I still ask dumb questions all the time. You will too. Don’t beat yourself up
over it. In fact, just yesterday I screwed up a particularly important meeting
by slipping into pitch mode (this was yesterday at the time of writing…
hopefully not again at the time of reading).


It happens. It’s okay. Review with your team, don’t beat yourself up (or your
cofounders) over mistakes. Work on getting better as a team.


I make tons of mistakes. At least now I notice and have a chance to fix them.
Most bad conversations can be fixed. You’re trying to do something
difficult. You’re never going to be perfect, but it always helps to be better.


People love startups. Startups do cool stuff and make their lives better.
Everyone supports the entrepreneur. When entrepreneurs screw up, people
want to forgive them. They want the entrepreneur and the startup to
succeed.


By asking good questions, we can fix many flawed ideas before they get us
in trouble. But still, sometimes it doesn’t work out. It’s okay. Go to the
people who believed in and supported you and thank them. If relevant,
apologise. They’ll say something like:


“Hey, don’t even worry about it — I know how it goes.”


Eternity will forgive our earthly blunders. Everyone loves an entrepreneur.

After all, you’re putting it on the line to try and make their lives better.


Rule of thumb: It’s going to be okay.

## **Hack it**


In ancient times it was prophesied that whoever undid the convoluted
Gordian Knot would rule the land. Coming across the knot, Alexander drew
his sword and with a single stroke, cut the knot in half. The knot was undone
and he became “the Great”.


Struggling to untie the knot was the “proper” process. Cutting through it was
a hack (ba-dum tish!). Alexander jumped straight to the end result without
any of the work.


When we find a new and exciting process, it’s easy to spend hours
obsessively geeking out about exactly the right way to untie this big, gnarly
knot.


At a workshop about customer segmentation, a personal trainer said he was
spending most of his time on the non-billable commutes between his clients.
At some point it was suggested that the police might be a better customer,
since he could go to the station and spend all day working with different
officers. No commute, more billable hours, and a less price-sensitive
customer. Sounds good in theory.


We all started geeking out about how he was going to validate this. Who
could he talk to? Did anyone have family in the police? What should his
interview questions be? What was the market size? Etc etc.


He looked at us like we were all idiots and held up his phone. “Why
wouldn’t I just call them?” It’s not like he didn’t know their number. We all
stood around a bit dumbfounded while he went outside and called the
police. Twenty minutes later, he came back in with a trial session
scheduled.


Having a process is valuable, but don’t get stuck in it. Sometimes you can
just pick up the phone and hack through the knot.
