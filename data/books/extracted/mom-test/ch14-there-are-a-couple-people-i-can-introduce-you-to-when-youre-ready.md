#### "There are a couple people I can introduce you to when you're ready."

Nearly a good meeting, but right now it’s bad. There’s some data here, but
probably not as much as you initially hope. On the bright side, at least you
know he doesn’t think you’re completely nuts or he wouldn’t have even
made the fluffy offer (unless he’s just name dropping). The problem is that
the promise is so generic that it’s a worthless signal.


To fix it, try to convert fuzzy promises into something more concrete. The
more specific it is, the more seriously you can take it. For example: who
does he want to introduce you to and what does “ready” mean? And why
can’t he make the intro now? This isn’t about being pushy. You don’t have
manifest destiny over his rolodex. But you do need to distinguish between
legitimate offers and polite gesturing. Knowing what “ready” means can
also give you a better sense of what your short-term goals should be.

#### "What are the next steps?"


Good meeting. A classic good meeting conclusion. To succeed, a meeting
doesn’t need to end with a check in your pocket. It just needs to advance to
the next step, whatever that is.


It's worth noting that you need to know your next steps to benefit from this. If
you have to say, “Let me have a think about that and get back to you,” then
you’ve ruined a perfectly good meeting.


Of course, even clear next steps can be a lie. Everything can be a lie. But
with next steps in your pocket, you've got a fighting chance.
