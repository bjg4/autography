## **Is this book for you?**

Hello,


You’ve read about Customer Development or Lean Startup and aren’t sure
how to actually go about having your first customer conversation.


You’re a traditional business or sales person aiming to be more effective
within a young company which hasn’t yet found its business model.


You mentor, support, or invest in startups and want to help them have more
useful customer conversations.


You’ve fallen in love with a new business idea and want to figure out if it
has legs before quitting your job.


You’re raising funding and the investors want to see more evidence that
you’re solving a real problem.


You find this whole process incredibly awkward and really wish there was
an easier way to do it.


You’ve got a vague sense of an opportunity and want to figure out exactly
what it is.


You’ve always wanted to build your own company and want to start making
real progress today.


This book is for you.
