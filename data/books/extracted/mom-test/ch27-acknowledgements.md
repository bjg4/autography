## **Acknowledgements**

A huge thanks to all the people who helped with feedback, and especially
those who took the time to write up their ridiculously useful line-by-line
comments: Daniel Tenner, Andreas Klinger, Veronica Torras, Dave
Chapman, Salim Virani, Sabrina Kiefer, Madeleine Evans, Spike Morelli,
Adele Barlow, and Orsolya Toth. Thanks!


Nobody gets through the startup life alone. Thanks to Paul Graham for taking
a punt on us when we were so clearly clueless and to Devin, Laurence, and
Ryan for getting on that crazy train. Thanks to Saul Klein for lovingly yelling
at me about sales every Friday and for forcing me to actually read 4 Steps to
the E.piphany. Thanks to Steve Blank for writing it. Thanks to Peter Read
and Andy C for showing me how sales really works.


Thanks to Ian and Pete for getting us settled in London. Thanks to my peers
in the Braintrust who were the perfect sounding board, and especially Salim
Virani for calling me on my BS. Thanks to Tom Stone, Dave Chapman, John
Spindler, and Tim Barnes for showing me the good bits of the startup
education world and giving me my first chance to teach.


Beyond the obvious influence from Steve Blank and Eric Ries, a big thanks
to some other writers who have directly helped this book with their work:
Amy Hoy on worldviews, Brant Cooper on segmentation, Richard Rumelt
and Lafley/Martin on strategy, Neil Rackham on sales, and Derek Sivers on
remembering that businesses are meant to make you happy.


And of course, big thanks for Mom & Dad for gently planting the
entrepreneurial seed through both encouragement and their own collection
of insane startup and/or shipwreck stories.


The cover was put together by Devin Hunt.
