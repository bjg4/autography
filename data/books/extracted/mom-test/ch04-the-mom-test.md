# **The Mom Test**


People say you shouldn’t ask your mom whether your business is a good
idea. That’s technically true, but it misses the point. You shouldn’t ask
anyone whether your business is a good idea. At least not in those words.
Your mom will lie to you the most (just ‘cuz she loves you), but it’s a bad
question and invites everyone to lie to you at least a little.


It’s not anyone else’s responsibility to show us the truth. It’s our
responsibility to find it. We do that by asking good questions.


The Mom Test is a set of simple rules for crafting good questions that even
your mom can't lie to you about.


Before we get there, let's look at two conversations with mom and see what
we can learn about our business idea: digital cookbooks for the iPad.
