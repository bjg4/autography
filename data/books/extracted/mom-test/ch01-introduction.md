# **Introduction**

Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating a delicate
archaeological site. The truth is down there somewhere, but it’s fragile.
While each blow with your shovel gets you closer to the truth, you’re liable
to smash it into a million little pieces if you use too blunt an instrument.


I see a lot of teams using a bulldozer and crate of dynamite for their
excavation. They are, in one way or another, forcing people to say
something nice about their business. They use heavy-handed questions like
“do you think it’s a good idea” and shatter their prize.


At the other end of the spectrum, some founders are using a toothbrush to
unearth a city, flinching away from digging deep and finding out whether
anything of value is actually buried down there.


We want to find the truth of how to make our business succeed. We need to
dig for it—and dig deep—but every question we ask carries the very real
possibility of biasing the person we’re talking to and rendering the whole
exercise pointless. It happens more than you’d ever imagine.


The truth is our goal and questions are our tools. But we must learn to wield
them. It’s delicate work. And well worth learning. There’s treasure below.
