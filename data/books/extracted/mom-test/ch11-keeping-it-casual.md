# **Keeping it casual**


We know that zooming prematurely and introducing your idea too early
creates biases and can get you stuck on a local maximum. In his original
book on Customer Development, 4 Steps to the E.piphany, Steve Blank
solves this by recommending 3 separate meetings: the first about the
customer and their problem; the second about your solution; and the third to
sell a product. By splitting the meetings, you avoid the premature zoom and
biasing them with your ideas.


In practice, however, I’ve found it both difficult and inefficient to set them
up. The time cost of a 1-hour meeting is more like 4 hours once you factor in
the calendar dance, commuting, and reviewing. It’s also a big time
commitment to ask from the customer before you’re in a position to show
them anything in return.


In the early days, asking for the first conversation was simply impossible
for me. I wasn’t credible enough, so nobody wanted to take a meeting just to
talk to me about their day. Steve recommends starting with friendly first
contacts. Definitely do that if you have them. Thanks to The Mom Test, the
fact that they’re friends won’t bias your data, so long as you ask good
questions. In my case though, I was entering a new industry with high walls
(brand advertising) and no friendly first contacts.


As my credibility built after a couple years in the industry, I found I was
now able to get meetings without any real “reason”. The 3-meeting structure
was finally viable! But once I started doing it, it felt like a bad use of my
time. The most precious resource a startup has is its founders’ time and
attention. You have to put yourself where you matter most, and I wasn’t
finding early customer meetings to be that place. I wished I could get the


56


learning without all the overhead.


If the solution isn’t a 3-meeting series, then what is it? You may have
noticed a trend throughout the conversation examples we’ve seen so far:
keeping it casual.


Let’s say I’m trying to build tools to help public speakers get more speaking
gigs and I bump into one at a conference. I’m not going to try to set up a
meeting. Instead, I’m just going to immediately transition into my most
important question: “Hey, I’m curious—how did you end up getting this
gig?” As a side bonus, we’re also now having an interesting conversation
and I’m far more likely to be remembered and get a meeting later.


When you strip all the formality from the process, you end up with no
meetings, no interview questions, and a much easier time. The conversations
become so fast and lightweight that you can go to a industry meet-up and
leave with a dozen customer conversations under your belt, each of which
provided as much value as a formal meeting.


The structure of separate problem/solution/sales conversations is critical
for avoiding bias, but it’s important to realise that the first one doesn’t
actually need to be a meeting.


Rule of thumb: Learning about a customer and their problems works better
as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting.

## **The meeting anti-pattern**


The Meeting Anti-Pattern is the tendency to relegate every opportunity for
customer conversation into a calendar block.


Beyond being a bad use of your time and setting expectations that you’re
going to show them a product, over-reliance on formal meetings can cause
us to overlook perfectly good chances for serendipitous learning.


Imagine that you’re in a crowded cafe, tapping away at your keyboard, when
your dream boy/girl sits down next to you. They’re wearing a charming hat
and give you a friendly nod before cracking open a dog-eared old novel
which just totally completes the mood. You slam down a quick espresso to


57


psych yourself up and fumble through some sort of awkward monologue
about how they seem like a really nice person and this is kind of weird
because you don’t even know each other but maybe they want to go get a
coffee sometime? Like, a different coffee? At a different place?


We know this is a silly situation. After all, the purpose of a date is to talk to
each other and see if you get along. Therefore, for all intents and purposes,
you were already on a date. And then you messed it up by trying to overformalise it when you could have just chatted a bit and skipped that whole
first date completely.


We’re going to pull exactly the same trick on our early customer
conversations. We’re going to strip the pomp and circumstance and reduce it
from a meeting to a chat. If we do it right, they won’t even know we were
talking about our idea.


I was considering a product idea to make office managers more efficient. I
played with the possibilities on Friday, figured out the big questions over
the weekend, and then went to an industry event on Monday. A handful of
office managers were there and without any of them realising we’d “had a
meeting”, I'd learned that the big problem was really about debt collection
rather than efficiency. I got there by just being interested and chatting with
them over a beer: “X seems really annoying, how do you deal with it?” “Is
Y as bad as it seems?” “You guys did a great job with Z… Where did you
get that from?”


Being too formal is a crutch we use to deal with an admittedly ambiguous
and awkward situation. Instead of leaving wiggle room for the unexpected,
everything becomes a process.


**Symptoms of formality:**


“So, first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I just have a few
questions for you and then I’ll let you get back to your day…”
“On a scale of 1 to 5, how much would you say you…”


Learning from customers doesn’t mean you have to be wearing a suit and
drinking boardroom coffee. Asking the right questions is fast and touches on


58


topics people find quite interesting. You can talk anywhere and save
yourself the formal meetings until you have something concrete to show.


At their best, these conversations are a pleasure for both parties. You’re
probably the first person in a long time to be truly interested in the petty
annoyances of their day.


Rule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking to you,
it’s probably too formal.
