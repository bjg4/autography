## **Cheatsheet**

Just in case you like lists.


**Key skills:**


Asking good questions (Chapters 1 & 3)
Avoiding bad data (Chapter 2)
Keeping it casual (Chapter 4)
Pushing for commitment & advancement (Chapter 5)
Framing the meeting (Chapter 6)
Customer segmentation (Chapter 7)
Prepping & reviewing (Chapter 8)
Taking notes (Chapter 8)


**The Mom Test:**


1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about

the future

3. Talk less and listen more


**Getting back on track (avoiding bad data):**


Deflect compliments
Anchor fluff
Dig beneath opinions, ideas, requests, and emotions


**Mistakes and symptoms:**


1. Fishing for compliments


115


“I’m thinking of starting a business... so, do you think it will work?”
“I had an awesome idea for an app — do you like it?”


1. Exposing your ego (aka The Pathos Problem)


“So here’s that top-secret project I quit my job for... what do you
think?”
“I can take it — be honest and tell me what you really think!”


1. Being pitchy


“No no, I don’t think you get it...”
“Yes, but it also does this!”


1. Being too formal


“So, first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I just have a few
questions for you and then I’ll let you get back to your day…”
“On a scale of 1 to 5, how much would you say you…”
“Let’s set up a meeting.”


1. Being a learning bottleneck


“You just worry about the product. I’ll learn what we need to know.”
“Because the customers told me so!”
“I don’t have time to talk to people — I need to be coding!


116


1. Collecting compliments instead of facts and commitments


“We’re getting a lot of positive feedback.”
“Everybody I’ve talked to loves the idea.”


**The process before, during and after the meeting:**


If you haven’t yet, choose a focused, findable segment
With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals
If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments
If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to
Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about
If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first


Frame the conversation
Keep it casual
Ask good questions which pass The Mom Test
Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals
Take good notes
If relevant, press for commitment and next steps


With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes
If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage
Update your beliefs and plans
Decide on the next 3 big questions


**Results of a good meeting:**


Facts — concrete, specific facts about what they do and why they do it


117


(as opposed to the bad data of compliments, fluff, and opinions)
Commitment — They are showing they’re serious by giving up
something they value such as meaningful amounts of time, reputational
risk, or money.
Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world
funnel and getting closer to a sale.


**Signs you’re just going through the motions:**


You’re talking more than they are
They are complimenting you or your idea
You told them about your idea and don’t know what’s happening next
You don’t have notes
You haven’t looked through your notes with your team
You got an unexpected answer and it didn’t change your idea
You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked
You aren’t sure which big question you’re trying to answer by doing
this
You aren’t sure why you’re having the meeting


**Writing it down — signal symbols:**


:) Excited
:( Angry
:| Embarrassed
☇ Pain or problem (symbol is a lightning bolt)

Goal or job-to-be-done (symbol is a soccer/football goal)
☐ Obstacle

⤴ Workaround
^ Background or context (symbol is a distant mountain)
☑ Feature request or purchasing criteria
＄ Money or budgets or purchasing process
♀ Mentioned a specific person or company
☆ Follow-up task


**Signs you aren’t pushing for commitment and advancement:**


118


A pipeline of zombie leads
Ending product meetings with a compliment
Ending product meetings with no clear next steps
Meetings which "went well"
They haven't given up anything of value


**Asking for and framing the meeting:**


Vision — half-sentence version of how you’re making the world better
Framing — where you’re at and what you’re looking for
Weakness — show how you can be helped
Pedestal — show that they, in particular, can provide that help
Ask — ask for help


**The big prep question:**


“What do we want to learn from these guys?”
