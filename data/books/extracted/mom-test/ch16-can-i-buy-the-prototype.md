#### "Can I buy the prototype?"

Great meeting. The best meeting conclusion I've seen is the rarely-heard but
always appreciated, “Can I buy the prototype?”


A product designer was once showing me a brilliant smartphone tripod he
was designing. He demo’d the 3D-printed prototype unit for me and I
immediately asked him how much it would cost to buy the prototype. He
laughed and said he’d gone through about a dozen prototypes already
because people kept buying them. That’s a good sign.

#### "When can you come back to talk to the rest of the team?"


Good meeting. Bingo! If you are selling anything to companies, you’re going
to have to talk to multiple people. If they won’t introduce you, then it’s a
sure bet you’re at a dead end.


Enterprise sales is tedious, but one of the perks is that you can get really
accurate signals like this one quite early in the process. Building consumer
products is a lot murkier since the customer conversation process doesn’t
mimic the purchase process.

## **How to fix a bad meeting**


The worst meetings are the wishy-washy ones that you leave with neither
rejection nor advancement. You are in no-man’s-land and you won’t learn
anything until you fix the meeting by forcing a next step (or rejection).


A lost meeting can often be saved by just pushing for a commitment at the
end while you're being brushed off with a compliment.


But don't be annoying. You aren't trying to strong-arm folks into handing
over their wallet. You are trying to cut through some of the polite rejections
and find out if they're actually going to become a partner/investor/customer.


If they aren't excited, then good news: you got the information you came for.
Assimilate it, decide if it matters enough to change your strategy, and then
keep on keeping on. The goal is just to put them to a decision so you can


71


learn whether you've found a must-have product and a real customer.


Rule of thumb: It’s not a real lead until you’ve given them a concrete chance
to reject you.

## **Don't pitch blind**


Even once you've moved on to more product-focused sales meetings, you
still want to start with some open-ended learning to get your bearings. You
may know what the market cares about, but figuring out what’s unique about
this particular person feels. It will make the rest of the conversation much
smoother, increases your chances of closing the deal, and also gives you
ongoing learning even after you've got a product.


Startup sales meetings too often go like this:

```
    You:
```

"We do X. Want to buy it?"


`Them:` "No thanks."


Those rejections aren't helpful. Hard pitching gives binary feedback: you
either nailed it or you didn't. That's okay when you're making fine
adjustments (tweak this feature) but bad for bigger questions (does anybody
care at all about what I'm doing).


Ask learning questions which pass The Mom Test. Then confirm by selling
it. This happens over both the life of your company and during a single
meeting.

## **Crazy customers and your first sale**


It’s pretty weird that anybody buys anything from young startups. In all
likelihood, before the year is up, you’re going to either go out of business,
abandon the product, or sell the company. And even if you stay the course,
there’s no guarantee you can actually do what you say you can do.


First customers are crazy. Crazy in a good way. They really, really want


72


what you’re making. They want it so badly that they’re willing to be the
crazy person who tries it first.


Keep an eye out for the people who get emotional about what you’re doing.
There is a significant difference between: “Yeah, that’s a problem” and
“THAT IS THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE AND I WILL PAY YOU

RIGHT NOW TO FIX IT.”


Steve Blank calls them earlyvangelists (early evangelists). In the enterprise
software world, they are the people who:


Have the problem
Know they have the problem
Have the budget to solve the problem
Have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution


They’re the company who will commit way before it makes rational sense
to do so. It’s the guy who will give you cash right now from his
discretionary budget to run a trial. Or who will fight for you against his boss
and lawyers when they’re saying the tech is unproven.


In the consumer space, it’s the fan who wants your product to succeed so
badly that they’ll front you the money as a pre-order when all you’ve got is
a duct-tape prototype. They're the one who will tell all their friends to chip
in as well. They’re the person reading your blog and searching for
workarounds.


We’ve got 2 takeaways.


Firstly, when someone isn’t that emotional about what you’re doing, it’s
pretty unlikely that they’re going to end up being one of the people who is
crazy enough to be your first customer. Keep them on the list, but don’t count
on them to write the first check.


Secondly, whenever you see the deep emotion, do your utmost to keep that
person close. They are the rare, precious fan who will get you through the
hard times and turn into your first sale.


73


In summary, after you've learned the facts of your industry and customers
and designed the solution, you start pushing for advancement and
commitments to separate dead leads from real customers.


Rule of thumb: In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is just
a side-effect.

**CHAPTER SIX**
# **Finding** **conversations**


Now that you know how to ask good questions and fix bad meetings, you
know enough to have good customer conversations. Take this opportunity to
go flex your conversational muscles and talk to some people.


If you’re scratching your own itch with this business, you likely already
know your customers. Great! Go talk to them. Now that you’re armed with
The Mom Test, they won’t be able to lie to you even though they know you.


But if you don’t already know folks, where do these conversations and
meetings come from?
