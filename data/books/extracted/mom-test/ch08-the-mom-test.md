## **Using the mom test**

You’ll notice that none of the good questions were about asking what you
should build. One of the recurring “criticisms” about talking to customers is
that you’re abdicating your creative vision and building your product by
committee. Given that people don’t know what they want, that wouldn’t be a
terribly effective approach. Deciding what to build is your job.


The questions to ask are about your customers’ lives: their problems, cares,
constraints, and goals. You humbly and honestly gather as much information
about them as you can and then take your own visionary leap to a solution.
Once you’ve taken the leap, you confirm that it’s correct (and refine it)
through Commitment & Advancement, which we’ll look at in Chapter 5.


It boils down to this: you aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is,
and in return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the
problem, you own the solution.


Before we move look at ways to confirm that you’re building the right
product to fit your customers’ lives, we’re going to look at fixing some of
the ways conversations go wrong.
