## **How to write it down**

Taking good notes is the best way to keep your team (and investors and
advisors) in the loop. Plus, notes make it harder to lie to yourself. And
when, months later, you decide to adjust the business's direction, you'll be
able to return to your notes instead of having to go do a whole new set of
interviews.


When possible, write down exact quotes. Wrap them in quotation marks so
you know it's verbatim. You can later use them in your marketing language,
fundraising decks, and to resolve arguments with skeptical teammates. Other
times the exact quote isn't relevant and you just write down the big idea.


In either case, add symbols to your notes as context and shorthand. I use 12
main symbols and make up more in the field as I need them. You probably
won't exactly copy mine, so don't worry about memorising them. You'll
build your own go-to list as you have more conversations.


:) :( :| ☇ ☐ ⤴ ^ ☑＄ ♀ ☆


**Emotions**


:) Excited
:( Angry
:| Embarrassed


Someone saying "that's a problem" should be interpreted totally differently
depending on whether they are neutral or outraged. Any strong emotion is
worth writing down. For example, depending on your industry, you might
also choose to make symbols for lust or laughter. Capture the big emotions
and remember to dig into them when they come up.


**Their life**


☇ Pain or problem (symbol is a lightning bolt)

Goal or job-to-be-done (symbol is a soccer/football goal)
☐ Obstacle

⤴ Workaround
^ Background or context (symbol is a distant mountain)


105


These five “life” symbols are your bread and butter. Combine them with
emotion symbols where appropriate. Pains and obstacles carry a lot more
weight when someone is embarrassed or angry about them.


Obstacles are preventing a customer from solving their problems even
though they want to. They're important because you'll probably also have to
deal with them. For example, a lot of corporate folks would love to use
cloud services and hate their current options, but can't use anything else
because their company's IT policy is an obstacle. Their workaround might
be to use their personal phone as a secondary computer or by doing certain
work at home. Also worth noting.


**Specifics**


☑ Feature request or purchasing criteria
＄ Money or budgets or purchasing process
♀ Mentioned a specific person or company
☆ Follow-up task


As we discussed, feature requests usually get ignored, but they're a good
signal to capture and explore. Must-have purchasing criteria are obviously
more important. Money signals are also key.


Write down specific names and companies. If it’s someone they know, ask
for an intro at the end of the conversation. If it’s a competitor or alternate
solution, write it down to research it later.


Put a big star on items to follow-up on after the meeting, especially next
steps you promised as a condition of their advancement/commitment.

## **Where to write it down**


You want to take your customer notes so that they are:


Able to be sorted, mixed, and re-arranged
Able to be combined with the notes of the rest of your team
Permanent and retrievable


106


Not mixed in with other random noise like todo lists and ideas


In practice, I’ve found that taking notes in my primary notebook is
practically useless. Over the course of several months’ sprawl, you set an
insurmountable search and retrieval task for yourself. If you won’t look at
your notes, they aren’t much good.


If you do end up taking notes in non-ideal places, you just need to spend a
little extra post-meeting time moving them over into your permanent format.
Otherwise you’ll be kicking yourself when you remember that amazing
quote someone gave you which you can’t quite remember well enough to
convince those skeptical investors.


What is a better note-taking medium?


Google Docs spreadsheets and Evernote are both great for team sharing,
search, and retrieval. Spreadsheets are wonderfully sortable if you write
your key signals in their own column. The downside is that it comes across
as rude to take notes directly on a computer during a meeting, so you add a
bit of mandatory post-meeting work to transfer your notes. I always found
this a bit annoying, but it’s way better than losing your learning in an offtopic notebook.


A dedicated notebook is fine, if you can remember to carry it with you and
use it. For a while, I would use my regular notebook for my customer notes
and then just tear out every page which wasn’t from an interview so it was
easier to find them later. Hardly the most elegant.


My favourite medium is index cards. Post-it notes also work. I carry around
blank cards and take notes on them, with one quote or learning per card
(along with a signal icon, of course). After the meeting I jot down the date
and name of the person on each card. It takes a couple minutes, but it’s faster
than moving over all your notes. When we review, we lay the cards out on
the table and sort through them. Cards are great because of the random
access and sorting. If you learn that the problem you’re solving doesn’t
really matter, you can just pull out all the cards marked with a lightning bolt
and find yourself a new problem that’s already been confirmed.


When I first started, I would make audio recordings, but that suffered from


107


the same problem as notebooks. I'd end up with a ton of content and no real
way to sort it or find the bit I wanted, so I ended up ignoring the recordings.


If you do want to use audio, you’ll find people are surprisingly willing to be
recorded. Put your phone on the table as you sit down and say, “Hey, is it
cool if I record this, because I’m always paranoid I’ll miss something
important in my notes. It won’t get shared with anyone or posted anywhere.”
Almost everyone says yes, but it does blow your cover if you’re trying to
Keep it Casual.


If you embrace Keeping it Casual, you'll find customer conversations
appearing out of nowhere and catching you by surprise. Just go with it. I've
got notes written on paper plates from a pizza party, on beer mats from the
pub, and on newspapers from the cafe. You'll want to transfer them over to
your main storage system once you get back to the office, but it's better to
capture what's said on something weird than to try to remember all the
important bits.


If it’s totally inappropriate to take notes during the chat, just have the
conversation and then immediately retreat to a corner to write down what
was said. This is how I usually handle customer conversations at the pub or
conferences.


Regardless of the medium, the most important thing is that the notes are
lightweight enough that you'll actually review them yourself and with your

team.


Rule of thumb: Notes are useless if you don't look at them.

## **The process**


Talking to customers is a tool, not an obligation. If it’s not going to help or
you don’t want to do it for whatever reason, just skip it. I’m sure you’ve
been on the receiving end of a half-assed survey sent out by some new
startup to tick the box marked “learn from customers” on their startup todo
list. There are better ways to waste your time.


Without figuring out what actually matters to your company and how to deal
with it effectively, you’re just going through the motions.


108


When it comes to conversations, it looks like this:


**Signs you’re just going through the motions:**


You’re talking more than they are
They are complimenting you or your idea
You told them about your idea and don’t know what’s happening next
You don’t have notes
You haven’t looked through your notes with your team
You got an unexpected answer and it didn’t change your idea
You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked
You aren’t sure which big question you’re trying to answer by doing
this


The persistent presence of any of these problems suggests that you’re doing
something wrong and wasting your time.


Here are the steps I go through to keep on track. Feel free to ignore or tweak
as needed given your situation and company. It’s as light-weight as I’ve
been able to get it and should reduce rather than increase the amount of time
you need to spend on conversations.


**The process before a batch of conversations:**


If you haven’t yet, choose a focused, findable segment
With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals
If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments
If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to
Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about
If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first


**During the conversation:**


Frame the conversation
Keep it casual


109


Ask good questions which pass The Mom Test
Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals
Take good notes
If relevant, press for commitment and next steps


**After a batch of conversations:**


With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes
If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage
Update your beliefs and plans
Decide on the next 3 big questions


The goal of this process is twofold. Firstly, to make sure you're spending
your time well by attacking the questions which really matter and using the
whole founding team’s brains. Secondly, to spread any new learning through
your team as quickly and completely as possible.


There you go. Now you know everything I do about how to learn from
conversations. Combine this process with The Mom Test, Keeping it
Casual, and Advancement for maximum learning in minimum time. But even
if it goes wrong, don’t worry so much. Eternity will forgive.

## **This stuff is fast**


The time scales of the process are important. The point is to make your
business move faster, not slower.


Don’t spend a week prepping for meetings; spend an hour and then go talk to
people. Anything more is stalling.


Don’t spend months doing full-time customer conversations before
beginning to move on a product. Spend a week, maybe two. Get your
bearings and then give them something to commit to.


You’ll keep talking to customers for the life of your company, of course. I’m
not advising you to become a recluse after the first two weeks. Your


110


customers are a crucial source of ongoing insight and will help catch any
badgers in the bush, so to speak. With the tools in this book (especially
Keeping it Casual) you should be able to keep benefitting from customer
learning without spending any real time on it. You can do it alongside
growing your business rather than in place of it.


This stuff moves really quickly when you’re doing it right. This book isn’t
meant you an excuse to squander precious months on theorising. It’s meant to
help you extract maximum value in minimum time from conversations so you
can get back to what really matters: building your business.


Rule of thumb: Go build your dang company already.
