# **Avoiding bad data**


They say that to bankrupt a fool, give him information. Practically everyone
I’ve seen talk to customers (including myself) has been giving themselves
bad information. You probably are too. Bad data gives us false negatives
(thinking the idea is dead when it’s not) and—more dangerously—false
positives (convincing yourself you’re right when you’re not).


There are three types of bad data:


1. Compliments
2. Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)
3. Ideas


Sometimes we invite the bad data ourselves by asking the wrong questions,
but even when you try to follow The Mom Test, conversations still go off
track. It could happen because you got excited and started pitching, because
you had to talk about your idea to explain the reason for the meeting, or
because the conversation is just stuck in hypothetical la-la-land.


These things happen. Once you start to notice, it’s easy to get back on track
by deflecting compliments, anchoring fluff, and digging beneath ideas.

## **Deflect compliments**


Most of your meetings will end with a compliment. It feels good. They said
they liked it!


24


Unfortunately, they’re almost certainly lying. Not necessarily intentionally.
They might want to be supportive or to protect your feelings. Or your
excitement might be rubbing off on them.


Even if they really do like it, that data is still worthless. For example,
venture capitalists (professional judges of the future) are wrong far more
than right. If even a VC's opinion is probably wrong, what weight could that
of some random guy's possibly have?


With the exception of industry experts who have built very similar
businesses, opinions are worthless. You want facts and commitments, not
compliments.


The best way to escape the misinformation of compliments is to avoid them
completely by not mentioning your idea. If they happen anyway, you need to
deflect the compliment and get on with the business of gathering facts and
commitments.


Before we look at how to properly deflect compliments, here's what
happens when you take them at face value:


**A bad conversation:**


`You:` “…And that’s it. It’s like X for Y, but better because of Z.”

Bam! Totally nailed that pitch.


`Them:` “That’s cool. Love it.” How is this relevant to me?

(Compliment)

```
    You:
```

“It’s going to totally change the way you work. We’re

predicting cost savings of 35%.” I am so great.

```
    Them:
```

“Sounds terrific. Keep me in the loop.” I can’t believe I

keep agreeing to these startup pitches. (Compliment + stalling
tactic)

```
    You:
```

“Awesome, thanks.” I’m just like Steve Jobs. Except more

handsome.


25


```
    You:
```

(Back at the office) “That meeting went really well. They

said they loved it! In fact, everybody loves it. I really think
we’ve finally found our big idea. We’ve found something
people want.” It’s margarita time!

```
    Your Team:
```

(6 months later) “Why do we have zero customers? I

thought you said everybody loved it?” Wasn’t this your job?

```
    You:
```

“I don’t know, I talked to like a thousand people. I must have

missed one of their buying criteria. Don’t worry, I’ll go talk to
them some more and we’ll get it next time.” Doooooomed.


Let’s try that again while properly deflecting the confounding compliments:


**A good conversation:**


`You:` “…And that’s it. It’s like X for Y, but better because of Z.”

Rats, I just slipped into pitch mode. Let’s try to recover this and
learn something.

```
    Them:
```

“That’s really cool. I love it.” How is this even relevant to

me? (Compliment)

```
    You:
```

“Whoops — really sorry about that — I got excited and

started pitching. Listen: you guys seem to be doing a good job
in this space — do you mind if I ask how you’re dealing with
this stuff at the moment?” That compliment made me suspicious.
Let's deflect it and find out whether they're a potential customer
or are just trying to get rid of me.

```
    Them:
```

“What? Oh, well, sure. We’ve got a couple people who

manage the process just to make sure we’re all in sync, and then
we use Excel and a lot of emails to keep it all moving. Anyway,
I really like your idea. I’m sure it will do well.” If you want
facts, here they are, but your idea still isn’t a good fit for me
and there’s no way I’m going to express an interest in buying
(notice the sneaky compliment at the end).

```
    You:
```

“I haven’t heard of anyone solving it quite like that — that’s

interesting. Can you talk me through how it actually all fits


26


together?” Let's ignore & deflect that compliment to focus on
the fact that they’re spending a lot of money to solve this. Two
full time staff!? I didn’t know it was worth this much.

```
    Them:
```

(More delicious workflow data)

```
    You:
```

“What sort of difficulties have come up with that solution?”

This is a bit generic and isn’t the world’s greatest question, but
I’m trying to find an anchor to learn about workflow
inefficiencies and bumps. When I find one, I’ll dig around that
signal with more follow-ups.

```
    Them:
```

(Even more workflow and alternate solution data)


If we’re early in the learning process, the meeting could end here quite
happily. We have the learning we came for. If we were slightly later-stage
and already had a product, we might continue by zooming in and pushing for
commitments or sales.


Remember though: you don’t need to end up with what you wanted to hear in
order to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth. Here’s a
good conversation with a solid negative result.


**A good (negative) conversation:**

```
    Them:
```

“That’s really cool. I love it.” Compliment.

```
    You:
```

“How are you dealing with this stuff at the moment?” Deflect

that compliment and get to the real facts.

```
    Them:
```

“Oh, it’s really not that big of a deal for us. We kind of just

ignore it.” The implications of the problem are non-existent so
I’m not in the market for a solution.


You can always be happy with a conversation like the above. You saw
through the false compliment and found the facts behind the mirage. If the
conversation is going well, I’d try to have them talk me through their
process anyway so I can try to figure out whether it’s an industry wide nonproblem or something specific to their particular situation.


27


Did you notice that in the conversations above, practically every response
contains a sneaky compliment? They are pervasive, constantly trying to trick
us into thinking the conversation “went well”.


Ignoring compliments should be easy, but it’s not. We so desperately want to
hear them that we are often tricked into registering them as positive data
points instead of vacuous fibs. Sometimes it’s easier to spot the symptoms
than to notice the original compliment.


**Symptoms (in the meeting):**


“Thanks!”
“I’m glad you like it.”


**Symptoms (back at the office):**


“That meeting went really well.”
“We’re getting a lot of positive feedback.”
“Everybody I’ve talked to loves the idea.”


All of these are warning signs. If you catch yourself or your teammates
saying something like this, try to get specific. Why did that person like the
idea? How much money would it save him? How would it fit into his life?
What else has he tried which failed to solve his problem? If you don’t know,
then you’ve got a compliment instead of real data.


Rule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer learning: shiny,
distracting, and entirely worthless.

## **Anchor fluff**


Fluff comes in 3 cuddly shapes:


Generic claims (“I usually”, "I always", "I never")


28


Future-tense promises (“I would”, "I will")
Hypothetical maybes ("I might", "I could")


When someone starts talking about what they “always” or “usually” or
“never” or “would” do, they are giving you generic and hypothetical fluff.
Follow The Mom Test and bring them back to specifics in the past. Ask
when it last happened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it,
and what else they tried.


The world’s most deadly fluff is: “I would definitely buy that.”


It just sounds so concrete. As a founder, you desperately want to believe it’s
money in the bank. But folks are wildly optimistic about what they would do
in the future. They’re always more positive, excited, and willing to pay in
the imagined future than they are once it arrives.


The first startup I worked at fell for the “I would definitely buy that” trap
and subsequently lost about 10 million bucks. They mistook fluffy future
promises and excited compliments for commitment, wrongly believed they
had proven themselves right, and wildly over-invested.


The worst type of fluff-inducing question is, “Would you ever?” Of course
they might. Someday. That doesn't mean they will. Fluff-inducing questions
include:


“Do you ever…”
“Would you ever…”
“What do you usually…”
“Do you think you…”
“Might you…”
“Could you see yourself…”


You don’t need to avoid these questions 100% of the time. They aren’t
exactly toxic. It’s just that the responses are useless. The mistake is in
valuing the answers, not asking the questions. In fact, sometimes these
questions can even help you transition into more concrete questioning.


29


**Transitioning from a fluffy question to a concrete one:**

```
    You:
```

“Do you ever X?” A fluff-inducing question.

```
    Them:
```

“Oh yeah, all the time.” A fluffy answer which has no value

in itself, but which we can anchor from.

```
    You:
```

“When’s the last time that happened?” We use the Mom Test

and ask for concrete examples in the past.

```
    Them:
```

“Two weekends ago.” We’ve successfully anchored the fluff

and are ready to get real facts now instead of generics and
hypotheticals.

```
    You:
```

“Can you talk me through that?” Back to asking good

questions.


To use a more tangible example, let’s say you’re designing some sort of
inbox management tool:


**A good conversation, anchoring generic fluff:**

```
    Them:
```

“I’m an ‘Inbox 0’ zealot. It’s totally changed my life.” A

generic (e.g. fluffy) claim.

```
    You:
```

“Haha, nice. I’m an ‘Inbox 0’ failure. What’s your inbox at

right now?” Let’s get specific to see if this fluff holds up.

```
    Them:
```

“Looks like about ten that have come in since this morning.”

Facts!

```
    You:
```

“Okay wow, so you are on top of things. I have like 200 right

now. When’s the last time it totally fell apart for you?” He’s
still claiming to be on top of his email, so I’m going to look for
concrete examples where he wasn’t.

```
    Them:
```

“Ug, 3 weeks ago. I was travelling and the internet at the

hotel totally didn’t work. It took me like 10 days to get back on
track.”


30


```
    You:
```

“Can you talk me through how you handled it?” Successfully

anchored — now we’re talking about what actually happens
instead of what “usually” happens.


In this case, we took the generic claim, “My inbox is always under control”
and added the important caveat: “Except when it’s not, in which case it’s a
total nightmare to recover from.” While using generics, people describe
themselves as who they want to be, not who they actually are. You need to
get specific to bring out the edge cases.


Let’s say you’re building a mobile loyalty app to help stores give deals and
discounts to their most loyal customers and you hear the guy in line in front
of you complaining:


**A bad conversation (pitching and accepting fluff):**

```
    Them:
```

“Which idiot decided it was a good idea to make me carry

around a thousand cafe loyalty cards?”

```
    You:
```

“Whoa! Hey! I’m building a mobile app to help stores give

out discounts to their most loyal customers so you’d never need
to carry paper cards again. Do you think you would use
something like that?” This is pretty much as bad of a question
as you can find. You’ve revealed your ego and asked a “would
you ever” question. You’re begging for a false positive.

```
    Them:
```

“Heck yes, it's about time! I would definitely use that.”

Fluffy hypothetical future promise!


By switching into pitch mode, we just wasted a perfectly good opportunity
for learning and instead got a fistful of fluff. Let’s try again.


**A good conversation:**

```
    Them:
```

“What idiot decided it was a good idea to make me carry

around a thousand cafe loyalty cards?”

```
    You:
```

“It’s crazy, right? My wallet is like two feet thick. Hey —

have you ever tried any of those loyalty apps for your phone?”
Anchor to past behaviours.


31


```
    Them:
```

“Those exist?” Perhaps my rage is misplaced…

```
    You:
```

“Yeah, I’m sure you’ve seen the little signs for that one in the

campus cafe.”

```
    Them:
```

“Oh yeah, I remember that. I’m always kind of in a rush.”

This is a nice bit of customer insight about their state of mind
and circumstances when you’re trying to advertise to them.

```
    You:
```

“Why don’t you download it now?” If someone’s being flaky,

put them to a decision. If they don’t care enough to try solving
their problem already, they aren’t going to care about your
solution.

```
    Them:
```

“I’ll do it next time.” Not a real problem.


You can’t help but laugh when you hear this one. “Someone should
definitely make an X!” “Have you looked for an X?” “No, why?” “There
are like 10 different kinds of X.” “Well I didn't really need it anyway.”


Long story short, that person is a complainer, not a customer. They’re stuck
in the la-la-land of imagining they’re the sort of person who finds clever
ways to solve the petty annoyances of their day.


Beyond rousting some poor soul’s consumeristic hypocrisy, anchoring the
fluff can also yield useful signals:

```
    You:
```

“…Have you ever tried any of those loyalty apps for your

phone?”

```
    Them:
```

“Yeah, I downloaded a couple of them. You need a different

one for every chain. I don’t want a hundred apps clogging up
my phone any more than I want a bunch of cards in my wallet.”


So he’s an actively searching potential user, but we’d need to get critical
mass with the stores he goes to before he'll be happy. Maybe we could take
over a small university town first. Or he might say:

```
    Them:
```

“I looked into it, but you only end up getting like a 10%


32


discount. That seems less like a loyalty reward and more like a
cheap way for them to collect a bunch of data about me.”


So he was on the fence, but needs better perks. Maybe we could find a way
to force merchants into deeper discounts like Groupon was able to do. He
also has privacy concerns. Or he could respond with:

```
    Them:
```

“Have you ever actually tried using that app? It's abysmal. It

takes me longer to find the stupid button than to buy my coffee.”


So all we need to do (for this particular user) is to out-execute and simplify.
We could try to be the Instagram to their flickr.


The list goes on. There are tons of useful responses you can get. Even
learning that the person is a non-customer is useful. To get toward this truth,
you just need to reject their generic claims, incidental complaints, and fluffy
promises. Instead, anchor them toward the life they already lead and the
actions they’re already taking.

## **Dig beneath ideas**


Entrepreneurs are always drowning in ideas. We have too many ideas, not
too few. Still, folks adore giving us more. At some point during a good
conversation, the person you’re talking to may “flip” to your side of the
table. This is good news. They are excited and see the potential, so they’ll
start listing tons of ideas, possibilities and feature requests.


Write them down, but don’t rush to add them to your todo list. Startups are
about focusing and executing on a single, scalable idea rather than jumping
on every good one which crosses your desk.


Let’s say you’re mid-conversation when this idea drops:

```
    Them:
```

“Are you guys going to be able to sync to Excel? I really

think that’s the a killer feature.”


What do you do here? The wrong response is to write “sync to Excel” on
your todo list and then move on. That’s the fast-lane to feature-creep.
Instead, take a moment to dig into the motivations behind the request.


33


```
    You:
```

“What would syncing to Excel allow you to do?” Maybe

there’s an easier way I can help you achieve the same thing.

```
    Them:
```

“We’ve got all these legacy reports and we need to go

through them every now and then. It would be nice to have
everything in one place, you know?” Don’t worry, it’s not a key
buying criteria.


Or they might say:

```
    Them:
```

“We’ve tried a bunch of these things and it’s always the

syncing that kills it.” They’re actively searching for solutions
which are all missing a must-have feature — this could be your
major differentiator if it’s important enough to the segment and
difficult enough for your competitors to emulate.


Or:

```
    Them:
```

“We have a decent workaround, as you saw. But it takes

nearly a week at the end of each month to pull all the reports
together in one place. It’s a big pain and totally stalls our
work.” They’ve cobbled together a home-brew solution, know
it’s costing them money, and are ideally suited to become an
early customer.


At my first company Habit, we were adapting our product to sell to
enterprise companies. MTV told me they needed analytics and reports for
their campaigns.


I made a big mistake by accepting the feature request and face value and
beginning the next meeting with a demo of our shiny new analytics
dashboard (custom-built to solve their request, of course). They “ooh’ed”
and “ahh’ed” appropriately and I left thinking we’d nailed it. It offered a
zillion options and could carve up your data every which way. It was
technically and aesthetically lovely.


Unfortunately, 90% of what we had built was irrelevant. We just didn’t
know that yet.


34


They started calling every Friday asking me to email over a CSV (data file)
of the week’s stats, so we added CSV export to the dashboard. Later, they
asked for the report as a PDF instead of an CSV, so we obediently built PDF
export. That took longer.


Salt was rubbed in the wound when, weeks later, they were still calling me
every Friday and asking me to export and send over the same stupid
analytics report. And every week, I would do so while politely explaining
that, you know, we built this awesome self-serve dashboard so they could
have their data whenever they wanted. And then, the next Friday, they’d call

me.


It turned out we had entirely missed the real reason they’d been excited
about our analytics demo. In fact, we'd missed their whole motivation for
wanting analytics.


The memory of being burned by feature requests was still fresh in my mind
when they asked if we could add their logo and colours to the reports. I
asked a couple incredulous questions about why in the world they wanted
this feature when they didn’t even use the ones I had already built, like an
exasperated Dad at Christmas: “But you don’t even play with the toys I
bought for your birthday!”


So, I finally—and inadvertently—did the smart thing when I asked, “Why do
you want this feature? What do branded reports get you that unbranded ones
don’t? It’s the same data, right?” She replied, “Oh yeah, of course. I mean,
nobody even reads these. Our clients just like to get something emailed to
them at the end of every week and we think they’d be happier if it was a bit
fancier, you know?” I knew exactly.


They had asked for analytics. We had jumped to the conclusion that they
wanted to better understand their data. But they had really wanted a way to
keep their own clients happy. If we had properly understood that, we would
have built a totally different (and much simpler) set of features.


Consider how much easier our lives would have been if we’d understood
the motivation behind the request. Instead of enabling the exploration and
export of all campaign data, we could have just always exported the few
high-level numbers a big brand manager would be interested in. And instead
of a self-serve dashboard, we could set up a little scheduler to send it to


35


them every Friday. In fact, we didn’t even need to build a dashboard at all.
And instead of coding up a layout and branding system for the reports, we
could have had an intern hand-build them each week. All wasted because I
didn’t ask the right question. I sure wish I had those 3 months back!


When you hear a request, it’s your job to understand the motivations which
led to it. You do that by digging around the question to find the root cause.
Why do they bother doing it this way? Why do they want the feature? How
are they currently coping without the feature? Dig.


You should dig in the same way around emotional signals to understand
where they’re coming from. Just like feature requests, any strong emotion is
worth exploring. Is someone angry? Dig. Embarrassed? Dig. Overjoyed?
Dig!


I once overheard a founder interviewing someone at a cafe table next to me.
The founder mentioned a problem and the guy responded, “Yeah, that’s
pretty much the worst part of my day.” The founder jotted something down
in his notebook, and then moved on to the next question. What!? It’s the
worst part of his day and you’re not going to figure out why? That’s insane.
You’ve got to dig.


**Questions to dig into feature requests:**


“Why do you want that?”
“What would that let you do?”
“How are you coping without it?”
“Do you think we should push back the launch add that feature, or is it
something we could add later?”
How would that fit into your day?


**Questions to dig into emotional signals:**


“Tell me more about that.”
“That seems to really bug you — I bet there’s a story here.”
“What makes it so awful?”
“Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?”


36


“You seem pretty excited about that — it’s a big deal?”
“Why so happy?”
“Go on.”


These nudges don’t need to be complicated. People love talking about their
opinions and emotions. Digging into a signal is basically just giving them
permission to do a brain dump.


Rule of thumb: Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not
obeyed.

## **Stop seeking approval**


As we’ve seen, compliments are dangerous and sneaky. So if we can nip
them in the bud before they bloom, so much the better. The main source of
compliment-creation is seeking approval, either intentionally or
inadvertently.


Doing it intentionally is fishing for compliments. You aren’t looking for
contradictory information. You’ve already made up your mind, but need
someone’s blessing take the leap.


**Symptoms of Fishing For Compliments:**


“I’m thinking of starting a business... so, do you think it will work?”
“I had an awesome idea for an app — do you like it?”


Accidental approval-seeking is what I call “The Pathos Problem.” It
happens when you expose your ego, leading people to feel they ought to
protect you by saying nice things.


This comes up when you tell someone about an idea you obviously care
about (which is pretty much always, since otherwise you wouldn’t be
asking). Even if you give folks permission to be honest and ask for
criticism, they’re still going to pull their punches.


37


**Symptoms of The Pathos Problem:**


“So here’s that top-secret project I quit my job for... what do you
think?”
“I can take it — be honest and tell me what you really think!”


To deal with The Pathos Problem, keep the conversation focused on the
other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. Once
someone detects that your ego is on the line, they’ll give you fluffy mistruths and extra compliments. Disregard that data and use The Mom Test to
re-focus on the person, their life, and their goals. People rarely lie about
specific stuff that’s already happened, regardless of your ego.


Some famous entrepreneurs don’t suffer the effects of The Pathos Problem,
but you should ignore their advice since it’s not reproducible if you aren’t
them. Guys like Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, and Gordon Ramsey are all
notorious for actively seeking negative feedback. It evidently works for
them. But nobody is worried about hurting Elon, Reid, or Gordon’s feelings.
You and I must be more circumspect.


In short, remember that compliments are worthless and people’s approval
doesn’t make your business better. Keep your idea and your ego out of the
conversation until you’re ready to ask for commitments.


Rule of thumb: If you’ve mentioned your idea, people will try to protect
your feelings.

## **Cut off pitches**


Being pitchy is the dark side of the “seeking approval” coin. Instead of
inviting compliments by being vulnerable, you’re demanding them by being
annoying. It’s when you hold someone hostage and won’t let them leave until
they’ve said they like your idea. Normally, compliments are wellintentioned. In this case, they’re just trying to get you out of their office.


“Won’t-take-no-for-an-answer” is generally a good quality for a founder to
have. But when it creeps into a conversation that’s meant to be about


38


learning, it works against you.


**Symptoms:**


“No no, I don’t think you get it...”
“Yes, but it also does this!”


If you slip into pitch mode, just apologise. You’re excited about your idea.
That’s good! Otherwise you wouldn’t have taken this crazy leap in the first
place. But suddenly, you find yourself five minutes into an enthusiastic
monologue while the other person nods politely. That’s bad. Once you start
talking about your idea, they stop talking about their problems. Cut yourself
off and say something like:


“Whoops—I just slipped into pitch mode. I’m really sorry about
that—I get excited about these things. Can we jump back to what
you were just saying? You were telling me that…"


If they say they really want to hear about what you’re working on, promise
that you’ll tell them at the end of the meeting or loop them in for an early
demo, and that you just want to talk a bit more about their stuff before
biasing them with your idea.


Rule of thumb: Anyone will say your idea is great if you’re annoying enough
about it.

## **Talk less**


You can’t learn anything useful unless you’re willing to spend a few minutes
shutting up (even if you have something really smart to say).


After you introduce your idea (either intentionally or accidentally), they’re
going to begin a sentence with something like “So it’s similar to…” or “I
like it but…” It’s tempting to interrupt and “fix” their understanding about
how it’s totally different and actually does do that thing they want.


Alternately, they’ll raise a topic you have a really good answer to. For


39


example, they’ll mention how important security is, and you’ll want to cut in
and tell them you’ve thought about all that already. This is also a mistake.


In both cases, the listener was about to give you a privileged glimpse into
their mental model of the world. Losing that learning is a shame. You’ll
have the chance to fill them in later. Plus, it’s annoying to people if they start
trying to help you and you cut them off to correct them.


Rule of thumb: The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing.

**CHAPTER THREE**
# **Asking important** **questions**


Once we know about The Mom Test and start trying to ask non-biasing
questions, sometimes we over-compensate and ask completely trivial ones.
Asking someone how old they are isn’t biasing, but it also doesn’t move
your business forward. You have to apply The Mom Test to the questions
which matter. Otherwise you’re just spinning your wheels.


In addition to ensuring that you aren’t asking trivialities, you also need to
look for the world-rocking scary questions you’re shrinking from. The best
way to find them is to run thought experiments. Imagine that the company has
failed and ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask
what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical
pieces.


You can tell it’s an important question when the answer to it could
completely change (or disprove) your business. If you get an unexpected
answer to a question and it doesn’t affect what you’re doing, it wasn’t a
terribly important question.


Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking a question which has
the potential to completely destroy your currently imagined business.


One of my companies had some legal ambiguities around content ownership.
It was okay in theory, but lacked strong precedents. I was always a bit
nervous we would get “found out.” Their execs were excited, their creatives
were thrilled. We had even brought the stubborn tech team around to our


41


side. But in all my early customer conversations, I never asked to talk to
their lawyers. For whatever reason, that was an important question which I
shrunk from, and not asking it cost us at least half a million bucks.


There’s no easy solution to making yourself face and ask these questions. I
once heard the general life advice that, for unpleasant tasks, you should
imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it.
Then do that.


And remember, you’re allowed to ask about money. You're a startup. It's
okay.


Rule of thumb: You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you’re
asking in every conversation.

## **Love bad news**


One of the reasons we avoid important question is because asking them is
scary. It can bring us the upsetting realisation that our favourite idea is
fundamentally flawed. Or that the major client is never going to buy.
Although it seems unfortunate, this we need to learn to love bad news. It’s
solid learning and is getting us closer to the truth.


If you’ve only got one shot, then bad news is bad news. If your bungee jump
doesn’t work, that’s bad. If you’ve sunk your retirement savings into opening
a cafe and it doesn’t work, that’s bad. If you hustle together $50k to start
your business and spend all $50k on your first idea only to see it fail, that’s
bad.


On the other hand, if you have $50k and spend $5k to learn you’re running
down a dead end, that’s awesome. You can use the rest to find a viable path
to your goal.


Similarly, if you have an exciting idea for a new product and go talk to a
couple customers who don’t actually care about it, then that’s a great result.
You just saved yourself however much time and money it would have cost to
try building and selling it.


We go through the futile process of asking for opinions and fish for


42


compliments because we crave approval. We want to believe that the
support and sign-off of someone we respect means our venture will
succeed. But really, that person’s opinion doesn’t matter. They have no idea
if the business is going to work. Only the market knows.


You’re searching for the truth, not trying to be right. And you want to do it as
quickly and cheaply as possible. Learning that your beliefs are wrong is
frustrating, but it’s progress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a
real problem and a good market.


The worst thing you can do is ignore the bad news while searching for some
tiny grain of validation to celebrate. You want the truth, not a gold star.


Some of the most informative (and thus best) responses you can get are
along the lines of, “Umm, I’m not so sure about that” and "That's pretty
neat." Both are lukewarm responses which tell you they don’t care.


In this context, “best” means learning, not selling. If you’re a sales guy going
door to door selling gadgets and someone doesn’t care, then that is a bad
result: you’re not getting paid. But if you’re trying to decide whether to
invest your time and money in developing, building and promoting that
gadget, then lukewarm is a terrific response. It gives you a crystal clear
signal that this person does not care. It’s perfectly reliable information you
can take to the bank.


The classic error in response to a lukewarm signal is to “up your game” and
pitch them until they say something nice. Unless they’re holding a check, the
only thing to gain from “convincing” them are false positives. You’re not
here to collect compliments; you’re trying to learn the truth. Their lukewarm
response already gave you that.


If they’re still engaged in the conversation, it’s worth asking a couple
follow-up questions to understand the nature of their apathy. Is the
“problem” not actually that big of a deal? Are they fundamentally different
from your ideal customers? Do they not care about the specific
implementation? Are they worn out and skeptical from hearing too many
pitches, like cafe owners in the aftermath of Groupon? Are they just plain
tired today?


After that, say a big thanks and leave them to their day. They’ve probably


43


helped you more than the guy who said he loved it.


Rule of thumb: There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!”
You can’t build a business on a lukewarm response.

## **Look before you zoom**


Another way we miss the important questions is by instead spending our
time on ultimately unimportant details. This can happen when we get stuck
in the details before understanding the big picture.


Most people have lots of problems which they don’t actually care enough
about to fix, but which they’ll happily tell you the details of if you ask them.
Before you have solid evidence that you’re fixing a meaningful problem for
your customer segment, you can really mess yourself up by zooming in too
quickly.


**A (really, really) bad conversation:**

```
    You:
```

“Hello. Thanks for taking the time. We’re building phone and

tablet apps to help people stay in shape and just wanted to
understand how you stay fit.” This isn’t a terrible opening, but
I’d generally avoid mentioning the idea immediately since it
gives them a good idea of which answers you’re hoping to hear.

```
    Them:
```

“Okay.” I never exercise, so this should be quick.

```
    You:
```

“How often do you go to the gym?” This sort of demographic

data doesn’t give you any new insight, but can still be useful at
the start of a conversation to figure out what sort of person
you’re talking to so you can ask relevant follow-ups.

```
    Them:
```

“Not really ever.” Well, looks like we’re done here then!

```
    You:
```

“What would you say your biggest problem with going to the

gym is?” This is where the conversation goes horribly wrong.
Instead of figuring out whether staying fit is actually a real
problem, we’re prematurely zooming in on it. Any response we
get is going to be dangerously misleading.


44


```
    Them:
```

“I guess the time it takes to get there. I’m always kind of

busy, you know?” Wait, who says I have a problem with going
to the gym? I thought I just told you I don’t care about the gym!
But if I had to choose one, I guess I’d go with convenience. Not
that I’ve done a pushup in 5 years. Pushups are pretty
convenient.

```
    You:
```

“Perfect. That’s great. And could you rank these 4 in terms of

which is most important to you in a fitness program:
convenience, personalisation, novelty, or cost?” Note that
we’re still assuming we’re talking to a person who actually
cares about getting in shape. Questions like this don’t actually
tell you if the person cares about any of it at all.

```
    Them:
```

“Probably convenience, then cost, then personalisation, then

novelty.” Since you asked, I’ll answer. Hypothetically
speaking, of course.

```
    You:
```

“Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. We’re working on an app

to help you exercise in the convenience of your own home. I
think it’s going to be a great fit for what you care about.”
Totally missing the point and mis-interpreting the conversation
as validation. Now fishing for compliments.

```
    Them:
```

“Cool. I’d love to try it when it launches.” Half-hearted

compliment plus non-committal stalling tactic.

```
    You:
```

“Great — I’ll send over one of our beta keys so you can

check it out.” We got a user!

```
    Them:
```

“Thanks.” I am literally never going to type that in.


The reason this conversation is so very bad is because, if you aren’t paying
attention, it seems like it went well. If you focus the conversation too
quickly on one problem area, you can think you’ve validated a “top”
problem when you haven’t. You just led them there.


If you ask me what my biggest problem with staying fit is, I’ll probably tell
you it’s the time cost of going to the gym. But then, if you build me a


45


workout-at-home app, I’m going to ignore it. Even though commute time is
the biggest problem with getting in shape, the whole area of fitness just isn’t
something I care about enough to act on. My #1 fitness problem is still an
unimportant one.


Let’s start the conversation again and fix it when it starts to go off track:


**A good conversation:**

```
    You:
```

“How often do you go to the gym?”

```
    Them:
```

“Um. Not really ever.” Looks like we’re done here.

```
    You:
```

“Why not?” Instead of taking for granted that staying fit is one

of their top priorities, let’s dig into the motivations.

```
    Them:
```

“I don’t know, it’s just not something I’m that worried about,

you know?” Not trying to fix this, so unlikely to buy or use an

app.

```
    You:
```

“When’s the last time you did try? Have you ever joined a

gym or taken up jogging or anything?” Let’s anchor the generic
just to make sure…

```
    Them:
```

“Oh yeah, I used to be into sports in high school. It just

hasn’t been a big deal since I settled down. Running around
after the kids gives me all the cardio I need!”

```
    You:
```

“Haha, gotcha. Thanks for the time!” This was a pleasant

conversation and we learned what we came for, so we can
abandon ship and leave him to his day.


The premature zoom is a real problem because it leads to data which seems
like validation, but is actually worthless. In other words, it’s a big source of
false positives.


Let’s re-run the same conversation, but instead of immediately zooming in
on exercise, we’ll start more generic, since we aren’t sure that fitness is a
must-solve problem:


46


**A good conversation:**

```
    You:
```

“What are your big goals and focuses right now?” Products

which solve problems on this list are infinitely more likely to
get bought. We might alternately ask for major annoyances,
costs, or joys.

```
    Them:
```

“The big one is finalising that promotion at work. And we

just bought our first house, so I’ve got to get that all fixed up
and ready to go. Exciting times. And I want to find a bit more
time for the missus, you know? Things have been pretty busy
lately.” Work, house, and marriage. Not looking good for us!

```
    You:
```

“You’re buying a new house and expect to be less busy?”

```
    Them:
```

“Can’t blame a guy for hoping.”

```
    You:
```

“Is getting healthier on that list?” We probably already know

the answer, but it doesn’t hurt to ask leading questions when
you’re about to abort the conversation anyway. If they come
back with a positive, just be a little extra careful in making sure
they aren’t lying.

```
    Them:
```

“I’m actually feeling pretty good at the moment.” Not a


customer.


However, we don’t always need to start the conversation from the square
one of do-they-care-at-all. Sometimes we know the problem exists as a top
priority and we can safely zoom in immediately.


For example, let’s say we help drive qualified leads to small business
websites. We know that marketing is always a top 3 problem for small
businesses, so we can focus on it and start the conversation by zooming in
with a question like:


`You:` What are your big problems with marketing? We can

immediately zoom in on the problem if we are 100% certain
it’s a must-solve problem which people are ready to pay for.


Versus:


47


```
    You:
```

What are your big problems right now? If we aren’t sure it’s

a must-solve problem, we start more generic to see if they care
at all about the problem category, in which case they’ll mention
it.


Now imagine you’ve built the aforementioned marketing tool for small
businesses and realise it could also be used to help bloggers get more
attention. You’re wondering if you have another strong customer segment.
However, since blogs have a harder time monetising traffic than small
businesses, we can’t necessarily assume that they’re also going to happily
pay for traffic.


For example, I have a blog which I quite like (but which I don’t take
seriously as a business). If you’re talking to me and you ask, “Hey Rob,
what are your top problems with marketing your blog?” Then you’ve just
prematurely zoomed on a non-problem.


I’m going to tell you some sort of answer which sounds legit but is actually
misleading. I might say that my keywords are all kind of generic, so it’s hard
to attract the right people. Or that I walk a fine line between writing
beginner and advanced articles, so it’s tough to attract the right people.
Whatever. Problems exist with my blog marketing, but the whole space just
isn’t something I’m too fussed about. I write because it’s fun, not because
it’s how I pay my rent.


To have a useful conversation, you need to zoom back out to ask about my
blog in general, rather than marketing my blog.


**A good conversation:**

```
    You:
```

“Hey Rob, what are the top problems with your blog?”

```
    Me:
```

“I’m pissed that Google Reader is disappearing — I feel that

I’m going to lose like half my followers. And this book is
consuming all of my interest in writing, so I haven’t really
posted in months. And Wordpress seems so slow these days.”
Of the topics here, one of them (Google Reader and audience
size) is related to marketing, so you can anchor on that and
figure out whether I’m a customer or just a complainer.


48


```
    You:
```

“That Google Reader thing is a mess. What are you doing

about it?” Now that you’ve let me raise the topic, you know it’s
on my mind and can more safely zoom in to talk about that
specifically. As before, try to figure out what I’m already
spending time and money on.

```
    Me:
```

“Nothing, really. I don’t know what to do. But it sucks.” I’m

not appearing terribly motivated, but the fact that I don’t know
what to do could give you hope.

```
    You:
```

“Have you looked into what your options are?” Continue

anchoring and digging.

```
    Me:
```

“No, I just caught the drama on Hacker News.” I knew the

reader-pocalypse was coming and didn’t even search around to
properly understand the implications and my options. This just
isn’t a big deal for me, despite how “annoyed” I claim to be.

```
    You:
```

“Are you going to make a serious effort to build your

audience back up?” You are digging into the audience size
signal, since it’s relevant to your space. It’s a fluff-inviting
question (hypothetical future-tense), so you should be skeptical
of the answer, but it’s hard to see a better way to get at the
information you want from here. Not every question can be
perfect, sadly.

```
    Me:
```

“Probably just keep on writing when I have something to say.

It’s more of a hobby than a business, really.”


At this point, you might be suspicious about how much I actually care about
my blog. When it’s not clear whether a problem is a must-solve-right-now
(e.g. you’re selling a painkiller) or a nice-to-have (you’re selling a
vitamin), you can get some clarity by asking cost/value questions like the
following.


**“Does-this-problem-matter” questions:**


“How seriously do you take your blog?”


49


“Do you make money from it?”
“Have you tried making more money from it?”
“How much time do you spend on it each week?”
“Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?”
“Which tools and services do you use for it?”
“What are you already doing to improve this?”
“What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?”


Some of these questions are generic, but give us signals that we can anchor
on and dig around. The bulk of them are about finding out whether the
person we’re talking to is taking this space seriously. Are they spending
money or making money? Is it in their top 3? Are they actively looking for
solutions?


When you fall into a premature zoom, you can waste a ton of time figuring
out the minutia of a trivial problem. Even if you learn everything there is to
know about that particular problem, you still haven’t got a business.


Rule of thumb: Start broad and don't zoom in until you’ve found a strong
signal, both with your whole business and with every conversation.

## **Look at the elephant**


Lastly, sometimes we comfort ourselves by asking questions which don’t
actually de-risk the business or resolve those critical, big, scary, lurking
questions. We ignore the elephant in the room.


Let’s say we suspect that teachers from the poorest schools are completely
overloaded, and that our tools would save them time so they could better
educate their students. We go talk to them and confirm that yes, they are
completely overloaded. We then spend weeks with them, figuring out
exactly what their dream tool would do. Unfortunately, we've missed the
elephant, which is that the poorest schools may not have the budgets
available to pay us what we need. We're liable to spend a huge amount of
time exploring a real and urgent problem, only to hop into the deadpool due
to our customer's budgeting issues.


Successful startups tend to depend on multiple failure points. In this case it


50


is both the needs of the teachers and the ability of the schools to pay us. If
any of these conditions doesn't exist, we have to significantly overhaul our
idea. It's tempting to obsess over the most interesting of several failure
points and ignore the others. It's a great way to miss important questions.


Beyond the risks of our customers and market, we also have challenges with
our own product. Overlooking the product risks is just as deadly as
overlooking the goals and constraints of our customers. Take the following
conversation with a professional public speaker. Is it full of good data or
bad data?


**An ambiguous conversation:**

```
    Them:
```

“…I get paid 2 or 3 grand per talk. Sometimes more if it’s

corporate work.” Some good pricing and value signals.

```
    You:
```

“Where do you get your gigs? Do you have an agent?” Trying

to understand the alternatives.

```
    Them:
```

“Yeah. He kind of sucks though. Most of my work comes

through people who just know me from my blog or have seen
my other talks.” Hardly a must-solve problem since he has a
reliable workaround, but at least it’s high value.

```
    You:
```

“What’s wrong with the agent? And why do you still work

with him?” Dig.

```
    Them:
```

“I’m one of the lowest-paid people they work with, so I get

ignored a lot. But sometimes he brings in deals, so whatever.
It’s free money.” Good information on his motivations and
goals.


At this point, let’s say I’m confident that getting gigs is important to him. I
also know what it’s worth and how he’s currently accomplishing it. So I
zoom in to introduce the problem I’m solving and the way I want to
approach it.

```
    You:
```

“I’m building a marketplace to cut out the agents and connect

event organisers directly with speakers. It should help you get
more gigs and keep the agent fees. How would that fit into your


51


speaking life?”

```
    Them:
```

“Man, that’s awesome. If you could get me more more gigs

— or better paid ones — I’d happily drop my agent and pay
you 20% of the boost. I know a bunch of other people who
would love to as well.” This is the important bit — is it good?


So what’s the result? Beyond being excited, we got some concrete data
about how valuable this could be to him. Plus, it involved a commitment to
be one of our early users. It sure seems good.


But what did he actually tell us? He said that if we can get him more gigs,
then he’ll pay a cut. Well, obviously. Who doesn’t want free money? His
needs are clear: he wants to make more money by speaking. If we can send
him work, he’ll share some of it with us. This was never really in doubt.


The key phrase of “if you could get me more gigs” is basically shifting the
burden from the customer to your product. Even though you’ve found a pain,
your success is dependent on a bunch of other factors, such as your ability to
grow a healthy supply of paying gigs which are a good fit for him. Will you
be able to do that? It remains to be seen.


This situation is easier to spot in the online advertising industry. Imagine
running customer conversations with an advertiser to try to understand their
pains so you can convince them to advertise on your site. They’d sort of
look at you blankly and say, “Listen, if you can get enough page views,
we’ll pay you for them.” In fact, it’s such a well established would-pay-tosolve-problem that you don’t even need to talk to them to set it up. You just
plug in an ad network and you’re done.


Similarly with affiliate commissions. If you sell a company’s products, you
get a cut. That’s just how it works. You don’t need to explore or validate or
understand their problems. The risk resides in your ability to get lots of
traffic and sell lots of products. If you can, they’ll pay you.


In all of these examples, the risk is in your product, not in the market or the
customer. The customer will pay if your product gets big enough.


Product risk — Can I build it? Can I grow it? Will they keep using it?


52


Market risk — Do they want it? Will they pay? Are there enough of
them?


You don’t want to overlook one or the other. I met a founder who had

wasted 3 months on worthless customer conversations. He wanted to start a
company building gadgets to track the fertility of farm animals, ultimately
boosting birthrates and thus revenue. When he talked to farmers, he asked
questions like, “Would you switch trackers if something cheaper and more
effective was available?” That’s the same as asking someone whether they
would like more money. The answer is always “Yes.” The farmers
responded along the lines of, “If you can build what you say you can build,
I’ll equip my whole herd.” The problem is, he couldn’t build it. The risk
was in the product.


I’ve also seen this strike several of the recent companies who want to use
mobile/realtime deals to drive foot traffic to bars and clubs. They run
customer conversations with bar owners who confirm that: yes, they would
like more customers on the slow nights; and yes, they would pay you if you
could send customers on demand. The founders take this as strong validation
(“They have the problem and committed to pay!”) without recognising that
the vast majority of the risk is in the product, not the market. Bars will pay,
but only if you can amass a huge audience of consumers. Then the founders
talk to consumers and ask if they would use an app which always pointed
them to booming parties with cheap booze. Again, obviously yes. But that
doesn’t tell us whether we can actually get to that critical mass of users.


Video games are pure product risk. What sort of question could you ask to
validate your game idea? “Do you like having fun?” “Would you like to
have even more fun?” Practically 100% of the risk is in the product and
almost none is in the customer. You know people buy games. If yours is
good and you can find a way to make them notice it, they’ll buy it. You don’t
need to rediscover people’s desire to play video games.


This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t talk to anyone if you’re building
something with product risk. In the case of the farm fertility monitor, it’s
good to know that the farmer isn’t opposed to switching tech once he’s
already got something installed, for example. For the nightclubs, it’s good to
know that they’re at least theoretically willing to pay for promotion. It
would be tragic to succeed at the hard work of creating the technology or


53


community only to learn nobody will pay for it.


What all this does mean is that if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed
to pure market risk), then you’re not going to be able to prove as much of
your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a
starting point, but you’ll have to start building product earlier and with less
certainty than if you had pure market risk.
