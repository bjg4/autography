# **THE SCALE ANTICIPATION FALLACY**

The other day I was talking to a couple of friends of mine, one a VC and the
other a CEO. During the meeting, we discussed one of the executives at the
CEO’s company. The executive in question performs exceptionally but lacks
experience managing at larger scale. My friend the VC innocently advised the
CEO to carefully consider whether the executive would scale to meet the
company’s needs in the future. I responded swiftly, aggressively, and loudly,
saying, “That’s a horrible idea and makes no sense at all.” Both of my friends
were startled at my outburst. Normally I am disciplined enough to refrain from
letting my feelings pass straight through my mouth without stopping at my brain
for review. Why the outburst? Here is my answer.

As CEO, you must constantly evaluate all the members of your team.
However, evaluating people against the future needs of the company based on a
theoretical view of how they will perform is counterproductive, for the following

reasons:


_Managing at scale is a learned skill rather than a natural ability._ Nobody
comes out of the womb knowing how to manage a thousand people.
Everybody learns at some point.


_It’s nearly impossible to make the judgment in advance._ How do you tell
in advance if an executive can scale? Was it obvious that Bill Gates would

learn how to scale when he was a Harvard dropout? How do you go about
making that decision?


_The act of judging people in advance will retard their development._ If
you make a judgment that someone is incapable of doing something such as
running a larger organization, will it make sense to teach them those skills
or even point out the anticipated deficiencies? Probably not. You’ve already
decided they can’t do it.


_Hiring scalable execs too early is a bad mistake._ There is no such thing
as a great executive. There is only a great executive for a specific company
at a specific point in time. Mark Zuckerberg is a phenomenal CEO for


Facebook. He would not be a good CEO for Oracle. Similarly, Larry
Ellison does a terrific job at Oracle but he would not be the right person to
manage Facebook. If you judge your team in advance and have a high sense
of urgency, you will bring in executives who can manage at high scale in
advance of needing them. Unfortunately, you will probably ignore their
ability to do the job for the next twelve months, which is the only relevant
measure. As a result, you will swap out good executives for worse ones.


_You still have to make the judgment at the actual point in time when you_
_hit the higher level of scale._ Even if you avoid the trap of hiring a scalable
executive too early or retarding the new executive’s development, you still
haven’t actually bought yourself anything by making the prejudgment.
Regardless of what you decided at point in time A, you still have to
evaluate the situation with far better data at point in time B.


_It’s no way to live your life or run an organization._ Deciding (with
woefully incomplete data) that someone who works their butt off, does a
terrific job, and loyally contributes to your mission won’t be with you three
years from now takes you to a dark place. It’s a place of information hiding,
dishonesty, and stilted communication. It’s a place where prejudice
substitutes for judgment. It’s a place where judgment replaces teaching. It’s
a place where teamwork becomes internal warfare. Don’t go there.
So, if you don’t prejudge people’s ability to scale, how do you make the
judgment? You should evaluate your team at least once a quarter on all
dimensions. Two keys can help you avoid the scale anticipation trap:


_Don’t separate scale from the rest of the evaluation._ The relevant
question isn’t whether an executive can scale; it’s whether the executive
can do the job at the current scale. You should evaluate holistically and this
will prevent you from separating out scale, which often leads to an unwise
prediction of future performance.


_Make the judgment on a relative rather than an absolute scale._ Asking
yourself whether an executive is great can be extremely difficult to answer.
A better question: For this company at this exact point in time, does there
exist an executive who I can hire who will be better? If my biggest
competitor hires that person, how will that impact our ability to win?
Predicting whether an executive can scale corrupts your ability to
manage, is unfair, and doesn’t work.

## **HOW TO LEAD EVEN WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW** **WHERE YOU ARE GOING**


“This for every ghetto in the hood

Nas the Don, Super Cat the Don Dada, understood.”


**—NAS, “THE DON”**

# **A**

fter selling the Loudcloud business to EDS, we immediately plunged into a
new crisis. Our investors could not understand how selling all of our revenue and
all of our customers could possibly leave us with anything worth investing in. As
a result, institutional investors sold all of their Opsware shares, and our stock
price fell to $0.35 per share. This turned out to be a noteworthy price, because it
computed to a market capitalization equal to half of the cash we had in the bank.
This signaled that investors believed that the Opsware business had no value,
and they further expected us to burn up half our cash before coming to our
senses and returning the cash to investors. To make matters more miserable, I
received a notice from NASDAQ informing me that if I did not get our stock
price above $1 within the next ninety days, they would delist us and we would
trade with the penny stocks.

I brought this cheery news to the board with three options:


**1.** _Reverse split._ We could reverse split the stock 10:1 and have ten times
fewer shares and a ten times higher stock price.


**2.** _Give in._ We could become a penny stock.


**3.** _Hit the road._ I could go on the road and try to get enough people to buy
so that the stock price would triple.


The board was extremely sympathetic and open to every option. Andy


Rachleff pointed out that the negative connotation with reverse splits among
investors had lessened due to the sheer number of them. Marc hypothesized that
being delisted in a post-newspaper economy might not matter so much.

Still, I did not want to reverse split the stock. More than anything, it felt like a
capitulation and a dramatic sign of weakness. Reverse splitting would say to the
market that I believed we really were worth half the cash that we had in the
bank. I also didn’t want the company to get delisted. I knew that Marc would be
right one day, but I also knew that many institutional investors were prohibited
from buying penny stocks in the current day and age. I decided to hit the road.

The first big question was “Hit the road to go see whom?” At that time, most
institutional investors wouldn’t invest in stocks with prices under $10, let alone
under $1. So Marc and I called our networking guru, the famous angel investor
Ron Conway, for advice. We told him the story, explaining that the $20 million
a year EDS contract alone made the Opsware business worth something, and
adding that we had a great team and huge amount of intellectual property, so
there was no reason for us to trade at half of cash. Ron listened carefully and
then said, “I think you should go see Herb Allen.”

I had heard about Herb’s investment bank, Allen & Company, but didn’t
really know much about him. Allen & Company was famous for running the best
business conference in the world. The conference is invitation-only and
consistently attracts guests whom you will never find at any other conference.
People like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Rupert Murdoch are regulars. Allen
& Company may attract more top-tier guests than all other business conferences
combined—it’s that good.

Marc and I arrived at the Allen & Company office in Manhattan, located in
the Coca-Cola building where Herb’s father, Herbert, had served on the board of
directors for many years. If a single word could describe the Allen & Company
office it would be _classy_ . Beautifully decorated, yet not flashy, the office was
both elegant and comfortable.

Like his office, Herb himself was both unassuming and classy. He opened the
meeting by complimenting Ron, saying that any referral from Ron was
personally important to him. Marc and I then carefully took Herb through the
story of Loudcloud—how we had sold the services business to EDS, retaining
the software and the key people, and had secured a $20 million a year software
license. Beyond that, we had a totally clean balance sheet and were surely worth
more than $0.35 per share. Herb listened attentively to the entire presentation
and then said, “I’d like to be helpful. I’ll see what I can do.” I had no idea if he


meant, as many in Silicon Valley would mean, “Screw off, I’m not buying a
penny stock” or if he meant what he’d said. I soon found out.

Over the next couple of months, Allen & Company bought Opsware stock,
Herb Allen personally bought Opsware stock, and several Allen & Company
clients became major investors. This activity propelled the stock from $0.35 to
$3 per share in a matter of months. We’d avoided delisting, rebuilt the
shareholder base, and given employees hope. Everything was largely due to a
single meeting with Herb Allen.

Years later I asked Herb why he believed in our company at a time when
nobody else did. I pointed out that, at the time, Allen & Company wasn’t very
involved in technology, let alone data center automation. Herb replied, “I didn’t
understand anything about your business and I understood very little about your
industry. What I saw was two guys come visit me when every other public
company CEO and chairman was hiding under their desk. Not only did you
come see me, but you were more determined and convinced you would succeed
than guys running giant businesses. Investing in courage and determination was
an easy decision for me.”

That’s how Herb Allen does business. And that’s why, if given the chance,
you’d be a fool not to do business with Herb.

## P erhaps the most important thing that I learned as an entrepreneur was to focus

on what I needed to get right and stop worrying about all the things that I did
wrong or might do wrong. This section encapsulates the various parts of those
lessons and provides guidance on how to get the important things right.
