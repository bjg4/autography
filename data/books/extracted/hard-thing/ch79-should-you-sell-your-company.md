# **SHOULD YOU SELL YOUR COMPANY?**

One of the most difficult decisions that a CEO ever makes is whether to sell her

company. Logically, determining whether selling a company will be better in the
long term than continuing to run it stand-alone involves a huge number of
factors, most of which are speculative or unknown. And if you are the founder,
the logical part is the easy part.

The task would be far simpler if there were no emotion involved. But selling
your company is always emotional and deeply personal.


**TYPES OF ACQUISITIONS**


For the purpose of this discussion, it is useful to think about technology
acquisitions in three categories:


**1.** **Talent and/or technology,** when a company is acquired purely for its
technology and/or its people. These kinds of deals typically range between
$5 million and $50 million.


**2.** **Product,** when a company is acquired for its product, but not its
business. The acquirer plans to sell the product roughly as it is, but will do
so primarily with its own sales and marketing capability. These kinds of
deals typically range between $25 million and $250 million.


**3.** **Business,** when a company is acquired for its actual business (revenue
and earnings). The acquirer values the entire operation (product, sales, and
marketing), not just the people, technology, or products. These deals are
typically valued (at least in part) by their financial metrics and can be
extremely large (such as Microsoft’s $30 billion–plus offer for Yahoo).


My take on the subject is most applicable to _business_ acquisitions, with some
relevance to _product_ acquisitions, and will be fairly useless if you are selling
people and/or technology.


**THE LOGICAL**


When analyzing whether you should sell your company, a good basic rule of
thumb is if (a) you are very early on in a very large market _and_ (b) you have a
good chance of being number one in that market, then you should remain standalone. The reason is that nobody will be able to afford to pay what you are
worth, because nobody can give you that much forward credit. For an easy-tounderstand example, consider Google. When they were very early, they
reportedly received multiple acquisition offers for more than $1 billion. These
were considered very rich offers at the time and they amounted to a gigantic
multiple. However, given the size of the ultimate market, it did not make sense
for Google to sell. In fact, it didn’t make sense for Google to sell to any suitor at
any price that the buyer could have paid. Why? Because the market that Google
was pursuing was actually bigger than the markets that all of the potential buyers
owned and Google had built a nearly invincible product lead that enabled them
to be number one.


Contrast this situation with Pointcast. Pointcast was one of the first Internet

applications to catch fire. They were the buzz of Silicon Valley and the
technology industry in general. They received billion-dollar acquisition offers
that they passed on. Then, due to flaws in their product architecture, their
customers started to turn off their application. Overnight, their market collapsed
and never returned. They were ultimately sold for a relatively tiny amount.

So, the judgment that you have to make is (a) is this market really much
bigger (more than an order of magnitude) than has been exploited to date? and
(b) are we going to be number one? If the answer to either (a) or (b) is no, then
you should consider selling. If the answers to both are yes, then selling would
mean selling yourself and your employees short.

Unfortunately, these questions are not as simple to answer as I’ve made them
out to be. In order to get the answer right, you also have to answer the question
“What is the market, really, and who are the competitors going to be?” Was
Google in the search market or the portal market? In retrospect, they were in the
search market, but most people thought they were in the portal market at the
time. Yahoo was a tough competitor in the portal market, but not so much in the
search market. If Google had really been in the portal market, then selling might
have been a good idea. Pointcast thought that their market was much larger than
it turned out to be. Interestingly, Pointcast’s own product execution (or lack
thereof) caused their market to shrink.

Let’s look at the case of Opsware. Why did I sell Opsware? Another good
question is why didn’t I sell Opsware until I did?


At Opsware, we started in the server automation market. When we received
our first inquiries and offers for the server automation company, we had fewer
than fifty customers. I believed that there were at least ten thousand target
customers and that we had a decent shot at being number one. In addition,
although I knew the market would be redefined, I thought that we could expand
to networks and storage (data center automation) faster than the competition and
win that market as well. Therefore, assuming 30 percent market share, somebody
would have had to pay sixty times what we were worth in forward credit to buy
out our potential. You won’t be surprised to find that nobody was willing to pay
that.


Once we grew to several hundred customers and expanded into data center
automation, we were still number one and were more valuable stand-alone than
any of the prior acquisition offers. At that point both Opsware and our main
competitor, BladeLogic, had developed into full-fledged companies (worldwide
sales forces, built-out professional services, etc.). This was significant, because it
meant that a large company could buy one of us and potentially execute
successfully (big enterprise companies can’t generally succeed with small
acquisitions, because too much of the important intellectual property is the sales
methodology, and big companies can’t build that).

At this point, it became clear that BMC was going to buy either Opsware or
BladeLogic. As a result, the calculus, or whether Opsware was going to be
number one in the market, needed to be redefined as follows:


**1.** We had to be number one in the systems and network management
market rather than the data center automation market, because like the word
processor market, the data center automation market was going to be
subsumed by a larger market that contained it.


**2.** In order to be number one, we had to beat BMC and BladeLogic
together, which was a significantly more difficult opponent than either
company stand-alone.


Finally, the market itself was transforming due to an underlying technological
shift: virtualization. Virtualization meant that the entire market needed to be

retooled, so we were embarking on a new R&D race to build the best
management for virtualized environments. This meant deferring earnings for a
very long time.

Based on all these factors, it made sense for us to at least consider the


possibility of acquisition and run a short process to understand the interest in the
M&A market.


Through that process, eleven companies made acquisition offers of some
form. This told me that we were at a local maxima in terms of the market price
for Opsware. In other words, the set of potential buyers was convinced that the
market was very important, and there was no extra premium that we could hope
to achieve through better awareness. In the end, based on a lot of analysis and
soul-searching, I determined that the current local maxima was higher than we
could expect to achieve in the next three to five years and I sold the company to
Hewlett-Packard for $1.65 billion. I think and hope that was the right decision.


**THE EMOTIONAL**


The funny thing about the emotional part of the decision is that it’s so
schizophrenic.

How can you ever sell your company after you’ve personally recruited every
employee and sold them on your spectacular vision of a thriving, stand-alone
business? How can you ever sell out your dream?

How can you walk away from total financial independence for yourself and
every member of your close and distant family? Aren’t you in business to make
money? How much money does one person need?

How can you reconcile _Dr. Stay-the-Course_ and _Mr. Sell-the-Thing_ ? Clearly
they are irreconcilable, but the key is to mute them both.

A few keys on muting the emotions:


_Get paid (a salary)._ Most venture capitalists like entrepreneurs that are
“all in,” meaning the entrepreneur has everything invested in the company
and will have very little to show for her efforts if it does not succeed. As
part of this, they prefer the founding CEO to have a very low salary. In
general, this is a good idea, because the temptation to walk away when
things go poorly is intense and total financial commitment helps him to
keep his other commitments. However, once the company starts to become
a company rather than an idea it makes sense to pay the CEO at market.
More specifically, once the company has a business (as defined above) and
becomes an attractive acquisition target, it makes sense to pay the CEO, so
that the decision to keep or sell the company isn’t a direct response to the
CEO’s personal financial situation, as in “I don’t think that we should sell
the company, but I live in an eight-hundred-fifty-square-foot apartment


with my husband and two kids and it’s that or divorce.”


_Be clear with the company._ One question that every startup CEO gets
from her employees is “Are you selling the company?” This is an incredibly
difficult question. If she says nothing, the employee will likely interpret this
to mean the company is for sale. If she says “at the right price,” the
employee will wonder what that price is and may even ask. If the company
ever reaches that price, the employee will assume the company will be sold.
If she dodges the question with the standard “the company is not for sale,”
the employee may feel betrayed if the company is ever sold. More
important, the CEO may feel like she is betraying the employee and that
feeling will influence her decision-making process. One way to avoid these
traps is to describe the analysis in the prior section: If the company achieves
product-market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be
number one, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will
likely be sold. This is one good method to describe the interests of the
investors in a way that’s not at odds with the interests of the employees, and
it is true.


**FINAL THOUGHT**


When faced with the decision of whether to sell your company, there is no easy
answer. However, preparing yourself intellectually and emotionally will help.

## **THE END OF THE BEGINNING**


“We walk the same path, but got on different shoes


Live in the same building, but we got different views.”


**—DRAKE, “RIGHT ABOVE IT”**

# **A**

fter selling Opsware, I spent a year at HP running the bulk of their software
business. And then I tried to figure out what to do next. Should I start another
company? Should I be CEO of someone else’s company? Should I retire?
Should I do something completely different?

The more I thought about my future, the more I thought about my past. What
would have happened if I’d never met Bill Campbell? How would I have
possibly worked my way through all the challenges I’d faced? Why was
entrepreneurship such a black art? Did everybody have the same problems I’d
had? If they did, why didn’t anybody write anything down? Why did so few
startup advisers and venture capitalists have any experience starting companies?

As these thoughts rolled around in my head, I sent Marc Andreessen an instant
message: “We ought to start a venture capital firm. Our motto for general
partners would be ‘some experience required’ as in some experience in founding
and running companies is required to advise people who are founding and
running companies.” To my surprise, he replied, “I was thinking the same
thing.”

## **SOME EXPERIENCE NECESSARY**


Further contemplation took me back to one of my first serious encounters with
venture capital.

Back in 1999, after raising our first round of funding for Loudcloud, my
cofounders and I went to visit our new venture capital firm and meet their full


team. As founding CEO, I remember being excited to meet our financial backers
and to talk about how we could partner to build a great company. The
conversation took a sharp downhill turn when one of the senior partners, David
Beirne, asked me, in front of my cofounders, “When are you going to get a real
CEO?”


The comment knocked the wind out of me. Our largest investor had basically
called me a fake CEO in front of my team. I asked, “What do you mean?”—
hoping he would revise his statement and enable me to save face. Instead he
pressed on: “Someone who has designed a large organization, someone who
knows great senior executives and brings prebuilt customer relationships,
someone who knows what they are doing.”

I could hardly breathe. It was bad enough that he had undermined my standing
as CEO, but to make matters worse, I knew that at some level he was right. I
didn’t have those skills. I had never _done_ those things. And I did not know those
people. I was the founding CEO, not a professional CEO. I could almost hear the
clock ticking in the background as my time running the company quickly ran
out. Could I learn the job and build my network fast enough or would I lose the
company? That question tortured me for months.

In the years that followed, I remained CEO, for better or worse. I worked
incredibly hard to become the kind of CEO that everyone expected. Thanks to a
lot of effort and help from friends and mentors, especially Bill Campbell, the
company survived and became successful and valuable.

Not a day went by, however, when I didn’t think about that interaction with
David Beirne. I always wondered how long I had to grow up and how I could
find help to build my skills and make the necessary connections along the way.

Marc and I discussed this paradox often. We wondered aloud why as founders
we had to prove to our investors beyond a shadow of a doubt that we could run
the company, rather than our investors assuming that we would run the company
we’d created. This conversation ultimately became the inspiration for
Andreessen Horowitz.


To get started, we studied the venture capital industry and we came across a
potential problem with our approach. Historically, all the returns in venture
capital had been concentrated in a tiny number of firms and consistently by a
small number of the same firms. Of the more than eight hundred venture capital
firms of the day, only about six had delivered great returns for their investors. As
we dug deeper, we uncovered an excellent reason for this: The best
entrepreneurs will only work with the best venture capital firms. Since venture


capital firms were notoriously secretive about their methods and beliefs—most
firms did almost no PR and stated very little about what they did—the firms
competed on their investing track records. Therefore, the firms with the best
track records continued to have the best track records, thus making it nearly
impossible for a new firm, with no track record, to crack into the top tier.

We needed some way to break through to become the firm that great
entrepreneurs wanted to work with. But how?

We needed to change the rules by which entrepreneurs evaluated VCs. We
thought there was an opening to do this, because times had changed. When Marc
and I first became entrepreneurs back in the mid-1990s, we did not know many
other entrepreneurs. We just did what we did, without really seeing ourselves as
part of a larger “movement” or a community. We were entrepreneurs at the
beginning of the Internet and before Facebook, Twitter, and the other social
networking platforms were built. We did not talk to other entrepreneurs, because
there was no entrepreneurial community. We were completely heads down on
the business. All that has changed in the last ten years. Entrepreneurs are now
socializing, friending each other, meeting up, and hanging out. There is a real
community. Once we realized this, we figured that if we had a better offering,
word-of-mouth marketing would work now where it hadn’t before.

We needed to be better, but we also needed to be different. As we thought
about what would make us both better and different, two core ideas greatly
influenced our thinking: First, technical founders are the best people to run
technology companies. All of the long-lasting technology companies that we
admired—Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook—had
been run by their founders. More specifically, the innovator was running the
company. Second, it was incredibly difficult for technical founders to learn to
become CEOs while building their companies. I was a testament to that. But,
most venture capital firms were better designed to replace the founder than to
help the founder grow and succeed.

Marc and I thought that if we created a firm specifically designed to help
technical founders run their own companies, we could develop a reputation and a
brand that might vault us into the top tier of venture capital firms despite having
no track record. We identified two key deficits that a founder CEO had when
compared with a professional CEO:


**1.** **The CEO skill set** Managing executives, organizational design, running
sales organizations and the like were all important skills that technical


founders lacked.


**2.** **The CEO network** Professional CEOs knew lots of executives, potential
customers and partners, people in the press, investors, and other important
business connections. Technical founders, on the other hand, knew some
good engineers and how to program.


Next, we asked, “How might a venture capital firm help founder CEOs close
those gaps?”

Addressing the skill set issue proved to be difficult because, sadly, the only
way to learn how to be a CEO is to be a CEO. Sure, we might try to teach some
skills, but learning to be a CEO through classroom training would be like
learning to be an NFL quarterback through classroom training. Even if Peyton
Manning and Tom Brady were your instructors, in the absence of hands-on
experience, you’d get killed the moment you took the field.

We decided that while we would not be able to give a founder CEO all the
skills she needed, we would be able to provide the kind of mentorship that would
accelerate the learning process. As a result, we decided that all of our general
partners would need to be effective mentors for a founder striving to be a CEO.
(Of course, not all founders want to be CEO. For some companies, the right
thing is to bring in a professional CEO. For those companies, we would focus on
helping the founders identify the right CEO, and then helping the CEO
successfully integrate into the company and partner with the founders to retain
their unique strengths.) This is why so many of the general partners we choose
are former founders or CEOs or both, and they are all highly focused on helping
founders become outstanding CEOs. The idea seemed so simple and obvious
that it had to work.


Next, we decided to systematize and professionalize the network. For this we
drew both the inspiration and the formula from my friend and Opsware board
member Michael Ovitz. Thirty-four years earlier, Michael had founded Creative
Artists Agency (CAA), the powerhouse of Hollywood talent agencies. When
Michael started CAA, it was not an obvious idea. The talent agency business had
existed since vaudeville and had changed very little in the ensuing seventy-five
years. Michael was a rising star at the William Morris Agency, the most
important agency in the industry at the time. Quitting that job to pursue what
must have looked like a windmill tilt made no sense to anybody. But Michael
had a clear vision: If he could build a firm so good that it attracted all the top
talent in the world, then he would shift the economics of the industry from the


corporations to the talent, where he felt that it belonged.

The firms of the day were essentially collections of loosely affiliated talent
agents. Agents worked under the same umbrella, but acted largely alone, each
agent tapping into her own network on behalf of her own clients. For example,
Agent A might introduce Dustin Hoffman to the head of Warner Bros., but both
the relationship with Dustin Hoffman and the relationship with Warner Bros.
were controlled entirely by the agent; other William Morris agents and clients
didn’t automatically get access to either. This traditional model sounded a lot
like the traditional venture capital business, where VCs worked in the same firm
but managed their own networks and their own portfolios.

Ovitz’s breakthrough idea was to build an integrated network that would
allow any of the firm’s agents to connect their clients to a firm-wide grid of new
opportunities. As a result, the firm would be a hundred times more powerful than
any one agent at any other agency. To implement the idea, Ovitz and his
founding partners agreed to defer their salaries for several years and invest their
commissions into building what Ovitz referred to as “The Franchise.” The
Franchise consisted of specialists running networks and portfolios in each
relevant area: book publishing, international, music, and more. His theory
worked, and within fifteen years, CAA represented 90 percent of the top talent in
Hollywood and had rewritten the rules—giving talent more say in deals and a
bigger piece of the financial pie.

We decided to copy CAA’s operating model nearly exactly—in fact,
Andreessen Horowitz employees have the same titles as the original CAA
employees: partner. Michael thought it was a great idea, but he was the only one.
Everyone else offered some variation of the following: “This is Silicon Valley,
not Hollywood. You guys don’t understand the business.” Still, with Michael’s
endorsement and enthusiastic support, we pushed forward with the idea. As we
applied it to venture capital, we decided to build the following networks:


**Large companies** Every new company needs to either sell something to
or partner with a larger company.


**Executives** If you succeed, at some point you need to hire executives.


**Engineers** In the technology business, you can never know enough great
engineers.


**Press and analysts** We have a saying around the firm: Show it, sell it;
hide it, keep it.


**Investors and acquirers** Being venture capitalists, providing access to
money was obvious.


Once we designed the firm, we needed to help entrepreneurs understand how
we were different. This seemed tricky, because no major venture capital firm did
any marketing of any kind. We figured there must be a good explanation for this,
but struggled to find one. Finally, Marc discovered that the original venture
capital firms in the late 1940s and early ’50s were modeled after the original
investment banks such as J.P. Morgan and Rothschild. Those banks also did not
do PR for a very specific reason: The banks funded wars—and sometimes both
sides of the same war—so publicity was not a good idea. This insight, combined
with our general instinct to counterprogram whatever the big guys were doing,
led us to launch Andreessen Horowitz with great fanfare. When deciding on the
name, the biggest problem we faced was that, as a firm, we were nobodies. No
track record, no portfolio companies, no nothing. But people knew us and they
especially knew Marc. So I said, “Rather than trying to create a totally new
brand from scratch, why not just use your brand?” Marc thought that made
sense, but nobody would ever be able to spell “Andreessen Horowitz” when
typing in the URL. Thinking back to old-time computer programming in the
days before programming languages supported internationalization, we used to
have to “internationalize” our code. We called this internationalization process
“I18N” for short (localization was L10N), which meant _I_ followed by eighteen
letters followed by _N_ . We decided that the firm’s nickname would be “a16z,” as
in _a_ followed by sixteen letters followed by _z_ .

We hired the Outcast marketing agency, headed up by its formidable founder,
Margit Wennmachers, to generate media interest. We needed people to know
what we were about as we had decided to defy the conventional venture capital
theory of no PR. The daughter of a German pig farmer, Margit was the furthest
thing from a swine wrangler imaginable. Smart and sophisticated, she was the
Babe Ruth of PR. She worked her contacts, landing a cover story in _Fortune_ in
2009 that featured Marc posing as Uncle Sam. Andreessen Horowitz was an
overnight sensation, and yet Marc and I were still the only two people in the
firm.


After eight years of running Loudcloud and Opsware, I had learned so many
hard lessons that building the team was easy. I understood the importance of
hiring for strength rather than for lack of weakness, and I understood the
meaning of “fit.” There are lots of smart people in the world, but smart is not


good enough. I needed people who were great where I needed greatness. I
needed people who really wanted to do the jobs they were hired for. And I
needed people who believed in the mission—to make Silicon Valley a better
place to build a company.

The first person we hired was Scott Kupor, who had been the director of
finance from Opsware. Scott worked for me for nearly the entire eight years, and
I’m not sure that he enjoyed any of it, but he performed phenomenally
nonetheless. He ran customer support, planning, and technical field operations
during those years, but none of the jobs were what he wanted to do. Scott loved
three tasks: running things, strategy, and deals. If he could do those things, he’d
almost never sleep. But at Opsware, he’d only gotten to do two of the three. Not
getting to work on transactions was torture for Scott. He was like a caged
animal. And I’d kept him in that cage for eight long years. So, when we designed
the firm, the first thing that came to my mind was “I finally found the perfect job
for Kupor.” Scott became the firm’s chief operating officer.

We then filled out the rest of the team. We hired Mark Cranney, head of sales
at Opsware, to run the large-company network; Shannon Callahan, former head
of recruiting and HR, to run the engineering network; Margit Wennmachers, the
Sultan of Swat, to run the marketing network; Jeff Stump, the best executive
recruiter we knew, to run the executive network; and Frank Chen, my former
head of product management, to run a centralized research group.

Our theory about what a venture capital firm should offer turned out to
resonate with the best entrepreneurs in the world. In four very short years, we
have gone from nothing to being one of the most respected venture capital firms
in the world.

## **FINAL LESSON**


“I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece

But my life been good since I started finding peace.”


**—NAS, “LOCO-MOTIVE”**


I often joke that I am considered to be a much better CEO now than I was when I
was actually CEO. These days people sometimes refer to me as a management
guru, but when I managed Opsware most people referred to me as, well, less
than that. As Felicia is fond of saying, “They called you everything but a child of
God.”


What happened? Did I change or did perception change?


There is no question that I learned a great deal over the years and I am pretty
embarrassed about how I conducted myself in the early days, but by the end I
became pretty good at running the company. There is plenty of evidence
supporting this view. I completely changed our business midstream—even while
it was a publicly traded company—and still managed to grow its value from $29
million to $1.65 billion in five years. A large percentage of the employees from
Opsware either work for me at Andreessen Horowitz or in one of our portfolio
companies, so they must have liked something about working together. The
acquisition by HP was the largest outcome in the sector, so we won our market.

Still, during the years that I was good at running Opsware—from 2003 to
2007—you would be hard-pressed to find a single article or blog post or
message board comment that said anything nice about me. During that time, the
press declared the company dead and shareholders called for my resignation. No,
I was not considered to be very good at all.

In retrospect, people’s perceptions changed because of the sale to HP and the
things that I’ve since written. Once I stopped being CEO, I was granted a
freedom that I did not have before. As a venture capitalist, I have had the
freedom to say what I want and what I really think without worrying what
everybody else thinks. As a CEO, there is no such luxury. As CEO, I had to
worry about what everybody else thought. In particular, I could not show
weakness in public. It would not have been fair to the employees, the executives,
or the public company shareholders. Unrelenting confidence was necessary.

When we started Andreessen Horowitz, I could let all that go. Sure, we still
have employees, but we do not have public shareholders who live and die on
every piece of press. More important, at Andreessen Horowitz I am not really
CEO. We invest in companies that have CEOs. The burden of unrelenting
confidence lies with them. I can now share my weaknesses, my fears, and my
shortcomings. I can say what I want without worrying about offending the
wrong people in the power structure. And it’s those fears and controversial
opinions that hold the clues to dealing with hard things. Hard things are hard
because there are no easy answers or recipes. They are hard because your
emotions are at odds with your logic. They are hard because you don’t know the
answer and you cannot ask for help without showing weakness.

When I first became a CEO, I genuinely thought that I was the only one
struggling. Whenever I spoke to other CEOs, they all seemed like they had
everything under control. Their businesses were always going “fantastic” and
their experience was inevitably “amazing.” I thought that maybe growing up in


Berkeley with Communist grandparents might not have been the best
background for running a company. But as I watched my peers’ fantastic,
amazing businesses go bankrupt and sell for cheap, I realized that I was probably
not the only one struggling.

As I got further into it, I realized that embracing the unusual parts of my
background would be the key to making it through. It would be those things that
would give me unique perspectives and approaches to the business. The things
that I would bring to the table that nobody else had. It was my borrowing Chico
Mendoza’s shocking yet poetic style to motivate and focus the team. It was my
understanding of the people underneath the persona and skin color that enabled
me to put Jason Rosenthal together with Anthony Wright to save the company. It
was even my bringing in to the most capitalistic pursuit imaginable what Karl
Marx got right. On my grandfather’s tombstone, you will find his favorite Marx
quote: “Life is struggle.” I believe that within that quote lies the most important
lesson in entrepreneurship: Embrace the struggle.

When I work with entrepreneurs today, this is the main thing that I try to
convey. Embrace your weirdness, your background, your instinct. If the keys are
not in there, they do not exist. I can relate to what they’re going through, but I
cannot tell them what to do. I can only help them find it in themselves. And
sometimes they can find peace where I could not.

Of course, even with all the advice and hindsight in the world, hard things will
continue to be hard things. So, in closing, I just say peace to all those engaged in
the struggle to fulfill their dreams.
