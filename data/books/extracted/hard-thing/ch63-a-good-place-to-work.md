# **A GOOD PLACE TO WORK**

At Opsware I used to teach a management expectations course because I deeply
believed in training. I made it clear that I expected every manager to meet with
her people on a regular basis. I even gave instructions on how to conduct a oneon-one meeting so there could be no excuses.

Then one day, while I happily went about my job, it came to my attention that
one of my managers hadn’t had a one-on-one meeting with any of his employees
in more than six months. While I knew to “expect what I inspect,” I did not
expect this. No one-on-one in more than six months? How was it possible for me
to invest so much time thinking about management, preparing materials, and
personally training my managers and then get no one-on-ones for six months?
Wow, so much for CEO authority. If that’s how the managers listen to me, then
why do I even bother coming to work?

I thought that leading by example would be the sure way to get the company
to do what I wanted. Lord knows the company picked up all of my bad habits, so
why didn’t they pick up my good habits? Had I lost the team? I recalled a
conversation I’d had with my father many years ago regarding Tommy
Heinsohn, the Boston Celtics basketball coach at the time. Heinsohn had been
one of the most successful coaches in the world, including being named coach of
the year and winning two NBA championships.

However, he had gone downhill fast and now had the worst record in the
league. I asked my father what happened. He said, “The players stopped paying
attention to his temper tantrums. Heinsohn used to yell at the team and they’d
respond. Now they just ignore him.” Was the team now ignoring me? Had I
yelled at them one time too many?

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that while I had told the team
“what” to do, I had not been clear about “why” I wanted them to do it. Clearly,
my authority alone was not enough to get them to do what I wanted. Given the
large number of things that we were trying to accomplish, managers couldn’t get
to everything and came up with their own priorities. Apparently, this manager
didn’t think that meeting with his people was all that important and I hadn’t
explained to him why it was so important.


So why did I force every manager through management training? Why did I
demand that managers have one-on-ones with employees? After much
deliberation with myself, I settled on an articulation of the core reason and I
called up the offending manager’s boss—I’ll call him Steve—and told him that I
needed to see him right away.

When Steve came into my office I asked him a question: “Steve, do you know
why I came to work today?”

Steve: “What do you mean, Ben?”
Me: “Why did I bother waking up? Why did I bother coming in? If it was
about the money, couldn’t I sell the company tomorrow and have more money
than I ever wanted? I don’t want to be famous, in fact just the opposite.”

Steve: “I guess.”
Me: “Well, then why did I come to work?”
Steve: “I don’t know.”

Me: “Well, let me explain. I came to work because it’s personally very
important to me that Opsware be a good company. It’s important to me that the
people who spend twelve to sixteen hours a day here, which is most of their
waking life, have a good life. It’s why I come to work.”

Steve: “Okay.”
Me: “Do you know the difference between a good place to work and a bad
place to work?”

Steve: “Umm, I think so.”
Me: “What is the difference?”

Steve: “Umm, well . . .”
Me: “Let me break it down for you. In good organizations, people can focus
on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things
will happen for both the company and them personally. It is a true pleasure to
work in an organization such as this. Every person can wake up knowing that the
work they do will be efficient, effective, and make a difference for the
organization and themselves. These things make their jobs both motivating and
fulfilling.

“In a poor organization, on the other hand, people spend much of their time
fighting organizational boundaries, infighting, and broken processes. They are
not even clear on what their jobs are, so there is no way to know if they are
getting the job done or not. In the miracle case that they work ridiculous hours
and get the job done, they have no idea what it means for the company or their
careers. To make it all much worse and rub salt in the wound, when they finally


work up the courage to tell management how fucked-up their situation is,
management denies there is a problem, then defends the status quo, then ignores
the problem.”

Steve: “Okay.”
Me: “Are you aware that your manager Tim has not met with any of his
employees in the past six months?”

Steve: “No.”

Me: “Now that you are aware, do you realize that there is no possible way for
him to even be informed as to whether or not his organization is good or bad?”

Steve: “Yes.”

Me: “In summary, you and Tim are preventing me from achieving my one and
only goal. You have become a barrier blocking me from achieving my most
important goal. As a result, if Tim doesn’t meet with each one of his employees
in the next twenty-four hours, I will have no choice but to fire him and to fire
you. Are we clear?”

Steve: “Crystal.”


**WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?**


You might argue that no matter how well managed a company is, it will fail
without product/market fit. You might argue further that horribly managed
companies that achieve massive product/market fit succeed just fine. And you
would be right on both accounts. So was it really necessary for me to make such
a dramatic speech and threaten one of my executives?

I think it was, for the following three reasons:


Being a good company doesn’t matter when things go well, but it can be
the difference between life and death when things go wrong.


Things always go wrong.


Being a good company is an end in itself.


**THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH**


When things go well, the reasons to stay at a company are many:


Your career path is wide open because as the company grows lots of
interesting jobs naturally open up.


Your friends and family think you are a genius for choosing to work at
the “it” company before anyone else knew it was “it.”


Your résumé gets stronger by working at a blue-chip company in its
heyday.


Oh, and you are getting rich.


When things go poorly, all those reasons become reasons to leave. In fact, the
only thing that keeps an employee at a company when things go horribly wrong
—other than needing a job—is that she likes her job.


**THINGS ALWAYS GO WRONG**


There has never been a company in the history of the world that had a
monotonously increasing stock price. In bad companies, when the economics
disappear, so do the employees. In technology companies, when the employees
disappear, the spiral begins: The company declines in value, the best employees
leave, the company declines in value, the best employees leave. Spirals are
extremely difficult to reverse.


**BEING A GOOD COMPANY IS AN END IN ITSELF**


When I first met Bill Campbell, he was chairman of Intuit, on the board of
Apple, and a mentor to many of the top CEOs in the industry. However, those
things did not impress me nearly as much as his time running GO Corporation
back in 1992. The company raised more money than almost any other venturecapital-backed startup in history and lost nearly all of it before selling itself for
nearly nothing to AT&T in 1994.

Now that probably doesn’t sound impressive. In fact, it probably sounds like a
horrible failure. But I’d met dozens of GO employees in my career, including
great people like Mike Homer, Danny Shader, Frank Chen, and Stratton Sclavos.
The amazing thing was that every one of those GO employees counted GO as
one of the greatest work experiences of their lives. The best work experience
ever despite the fact that their careers stood still, they made no money, and they
were front-page failures. GO was a good place to work.

This made me realize what an amazingly effective CEO Bill was. Apparently,
John Doerr thought that, too, because when Scott Cook needed a CEO for Intuit,
John recommended Bill even though Bill lost a ton of John’s money at GO. And


for years, everyone who ever came into contact with GO employees knew what
Bill was about. He was about building good companies.

If you do nothing else, be like Bill and build a good company.


# **WHY STARTUPS SHOULD TRAIN THEIR** **PEOPLE**

I learned about why startups should train their people when I worked at
Netscape. People at McDonald’s get trained for their positions, but people with
far more complicated jobs don’t. It makes no sense. Would you want to stand on
the line of the untrained person at McDonald’s? Would you want to use the
software written by the engineer who was never told how the rest of the code
worked? A lot of companies think their employees are so smart that they require
no training. That’s silly.

When I first became a manager, I had mixed feelings about training.
Logically, training for high-tech companies made sense, but my personal
experience with training programs at the companies where I had worked was
underwhelming. The courses were taught by outside firms who didn’t really
understand our business and were teaching things that weren’t relevant. Then I
read chapter 16 of Andy Grove’s management classic, _High Output_
_Management_, titled “Why Training Is the Boss’s Job,” and it changed my career.
Grove wrote, “Most managers seem to feel that training employees is a job that
should be left to others. I, on the other hand, strongly believe that the manager
should do it himself.”


When I was director of product management at Netscape, I was feeling
frustrated by how little value most product managers added to the business.
Based on Andy’s guidance, I wrote a short document called “Good Product
Manager/Bad Product Manager,” which I used to train the team on my basic
expectations. (That document follows on page 111.) I was shocked by what
happened next. The performance of my team instantly improved. Product
managers whom I had almost written off as hopeless became effective. Pretty
soon I was managing the highest-performing team in the company. Based on this
experience, after starting Loudcloud, I heavily invested in training. I credit that
investment with much of our eventual success. And the whole thing started with
a simple decision to train my people and an even simpler training document. So,
I will now pay forward my debt to Andy Grove and explain why, what, and how


you should do the same in your company.


**WHY YOU SHOULD TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE**


Almost everyone who builds a technology company knows that people are the
most important asset. Properly run startups place a great deal of emphasis on
recruiting and the interview process in order to build their talent base. Too often
the investment in people stops there. There are four core reasons why it
shouldn’t:

# **1. Productivity**


I often see startups keep careful statistics of how many candidates they’ve
screened, how many have made it to the full interview process, and how many
people they’ve hired. All of these statistics are interesting, but the most
important statistic is missing: How many fully productive employees have they
added? By failing to measure progress toward the actual goal, they lose sight of
the value of training. If they measured productivity, they might be horrified to
find that all those investments in recruiting, hiring, and integration were going to
waste. Even if they were made aware of low productivity among new
employees, most CEOs think that they don’t have time to invest in training.
Andy Grove does the math and shows that the opposite is true:


_Training is, quite simply, one of the highest-leverage activities a_
_manager can perform. Consider for a moment the possibility of your putting_
_on a series of four lectures for members of your department. Let’s count on_
_three hours preparation for each hour of course time—twelve hours of work_
_in total. Say that you have ten students in your class._

_Next year they will work a total of about twenty thousand hours for your_
_organization. If your training efforts result in a 1 percent improvement in_
_your subordinates’ performance, your company will gain the equivalent of_
_two hundred hours of work as the result of the expenditure of your twelve_
_hours._

# **2. Performance management**


When people interview managers, they often like to ask, Have you fired anyone?


Or how many people have you fired? Or how would you go about firing
someone? These are all fine questions, but often the right question is the one that
isn’t asked: When you fired the person, how did you know with certainty that the
employee both understood the expectations of the job and was still missing
them? The best answer is that the manager clearly set expectations when she
trained the employee for the job. If you don’t train your people, you establish no
basis for performance management. As a result, performance management in
your company will be sloppy and inconsistent.

# **3. Product quality**


Often founders start companies with visions of elegant, beautiful product
architectures that will solve so many of the nasty issues that they were forced to
deal with in their previous jobs. Then, as their company becomes successful,
they find that their beautiful product architecture has turned into a Frankenstein.
How does this happen? As success drives the need to hire new engineers at a
rapid rate, companies neglect to train the new engineers properly. As the
engineers are assigned tasks, they figure out how to complete them as best they
can. Often this means replicating existing facilities in the architecture, which
leads to inconsistencies in the user experience, performance problems, and a
general mess. And you thought training was expensive.

# **4. Employee retention**


During a time of particularly high attrition at Netscape, I decided to read all of
the exit interviews for the entire company to better understand why people quit
high-tech companies. After putting economics aside, I found that there were two
primary reasons why people quit:


They hated their manager; generally the employees were appalled by the
lack of guidance, career development, and feedback they were receiving.


They weren’t learning anything: The company wasn’t investing resources
in helping employees develop new skills.


An outstanding training program can address both issues head-on.


**WHAT SHOULD YOU DO FIRST?**


The best place to start is with the topic that is most relevant to your employees:
the knowledge and skill that they need to do their job. I call this functional
training. Functional training can be as simple as training a new employee on
your expectations for them (see “Good Product Manager/Bad Product
Manager”) and as complex as a multiweek engineering boot camp to bring new
recruits completely up to speed on all of the historical architectural nuances of
your product. The training courses should be tailored to the specific job. If you
attempt the more complex-style course, be sure to enlist the best experts on the
team as well as the manager. As a happy side effect, this type of effort will do
more to build a powerful, positive company culture than a hundred culturebuilding strategic off-site meetings.

The other essential component of a company’s training program is
management training. Management training is the best place to start setting
expectations for your management team. Do you expect them to hold regular
one-on-one meetings with their employees? Do you expect them to give
performance feedback? Do you expect them to train their people? Do you expect
them to agree on objectives with their team? If you do, then you’d better tell
them, because the management state of the art in technology companies is
extremely poor. Once you’ve set expectations, the next set of management
courses has already been defined; they are the courses that teach your managers
how to do the things you expect (how to write a performance review or how to
conduct a one-on-one).

Once you have management training and functional training in place, there are
other opportunities as well. One of the great things about building a tech
company is the amazing people that you can hire. Take your best people and
encourage them to share their most developed skills. Training in such topics as
negotiating, interviewing, and finance will enhance your company’s competency
in those areas as well as improve employee morale. Teaching can also become a
badge of honor for employees who achieve an elite level of competence.


**IMPLEMENTING YOUR TRAINING PROGRAM**


Now that we understand the value of the training and what to train on, how do
we get our organization to do what we want? The first thing to recognize is that
no startup has time to do optional things. Therefore, training must be mandatory.
The first two types of training (functional and management) can be easily


enforced as follows:


Enforce functional training by withholding new employee requisitions.
As Andy Grove writes, there are only two ways for a manager to improve
the output of an employee: motivation and training. Therefore, training
should be the most basic requirement for all managers in your organization.
An effective way to enforce this requirement is by withholding new
employee requisitions from managers until they’ve developed a training
program for the TBH, “To Be Hired.”


Enforce management training by teaching it yourself. Managing the
company is the CEO’s job. While you won’t have time to teach all of the
management courses yourself, you should teach the course on management
expectations, because they are, after all, _your_ expectations. Make it an
honor to participate in these sessions by selecting the best managers on your
team to teach the other courses. And make that mandatory, too.


Ironically, the biggest obstacle to putting a training program in place is the
perception that it will take too much time. Keep in mind that there is no
investment that you can make that will do more to improve productivity in your
company. Therefore, being too busy to train is the moral equivalent of being too
hungry to eat. Furthermore, it’s not that hard to create basic training courses.

## W hen I ran the server product management group at Netscape, I became

extremely frustrated that everybody on the team I inherited had a completely
unique and different interpretation of their job. Finally, I had an epiphany that
nobody in the industry had ever defined the product management job. What
follows was my attempt to do that and bring down my blood pressure.
Amazingly, people still read it today. This taught me the importance of training.


**GOOD PRODUCT MANAGER/BAD PRODUCT MANAGER**


Good product managers know the market, the product, the product line, and the
competition extremely well and operate from a strong basis of knowledge and
confidence. A good product manager is the CEO of the product. Good product
managers take full responsibility and measure themselves in terms of the success
of the product.

They are responsible for right product/right time and all that entails. A good


product manager knows the context going in (the company, our revenue funding,
competition, etc.), and they take responsibility for devising and executing a
winning plan (no excuses).

Bad product managers have lots of excuses. Not enough funding, the
engineering manager is an idiot, Microsoft has ten times as many engineers
working on it, I’m overworked, I don’t get enough direction. Our CEO doesn’t
make these kinds of excuses and neither should the CEO of a product.

Good product managers don’t get all of their time sucked up by the various
organizations that must work together to deliver the right product at the right
time. They don’t take all the product team minutes; they don’t project manage
the various functions; they are not gofers for engineering. They are not part of
the product team; they manage the product team. Engineering teams don’t
consider good product managers a “marketing resource.” Good product
managers are the marketing counterparts to the engineering manager.

Good product managers crisply define the target, the “what” (as opposed to
the “how”), and manage the delivery of the “what.” Bad product managers feel
best about themselves when they figure out “how.” Good product managers
communicate crisply to engineering in writing as well as verbally. Good product
managers don’t give direction informally. Good product managers gather
information informally.

Good product managers create collateral, FAQs, presentations, and white
papers that can be leveraged by salespeople, marketing people, and executives.
Bad product managers complain that they spend all day answering questions for
the sales force and are swamped. Good product managers anticipate the serious
product flaws and build real solutions. Bad product managers put out fires all
day.

Good product managers take written positions on important issues
(competitive silver bullets, tough architectural choices, tough product decisions,
and markets to attack or yield). Bad product managers voice their opinions
verbally and lament that the “powers that be” won’t let it happen. Once bad
product managers fail, they point out that they predicted they would fail.

Good product managers focus the team on revenue and customers. Bad
product managers focus the team on how many features competitors are
building. Good product managers define good products that can be executed
with a strong effort. Bad product managers define good products that can’t be
executed or let engineering build whatever they want (that is, solve the hardest
problem).


Good product managers think in terms of delivering superior value to the
marketplace during product planning and achieving market share and revenue
goals during the go-to-market phase. Bad product managers get very confused
about the differences among delivering value, matching competitive features,
pricing, and ubiquity. Good product managers decompose problems. Bad
product managers combine all problems into one.

Good product managers think about the story they want written by the press.
Bad product managers think about covering every feature and being absolutely
technically accurate with the press. Good product managers ask the press
questions. Bad product managers answer any press question. Good product
managers assume members of the press and the analyst community are really
smart. Bad product managers assume that journalists and analysts are dumb
because they don’t understand the subtle nuances of their particular technology.

Good product managers err on the side of clarity. Bad product managers never
even explain the obvious. Good product managers define their job and their
success. Bad product managers constantly want to be told what to do.

Good product managers send their status reports in on time every week,
because they are disciplined. Bad product managers forget to send in their status
reports on time, because they don’t value discipline.


# **IS IT OKAY TO HIRE PEOPLE FROM YOUR** **FRIEND’S COMPANY?**

Every good technology company needs great people. The best companies invest
time, money, and sweat equity into becoming world-class recruiting machines.
But how far should you take your quest to build the world’s greatest team? Is it
fair game to hire employees from your friend’s company? Will you still be
friends?


First, what do I mean by “friends”? There are two relevant categories:


Important business partners


Friends


For this discussion, friends and important business partners are roughly the

same.


Most CEOs would never target a friend’s company as a source of talent. As
CEO, one generally doesn’t have many true friends in business, and raiding your
friend’s company is a sure way to lose one. Nevertheless, almost every CEO will
be faced with the decision of whether to hire an employee out of her friend’s
company. How does it happen? When is it okay? When will it cost you a friend?


**BUT THEY WERE ALREADY LOOKING**


It always starts in the same way. Your friend Cathy has a great engineer working
for her named Mitchell. Mitchell happens to be friends with one of your top
engineers. Your engineer brings Mitchell in for an interview, unbeknownst to
you, and he naturally sails through the process. The final step is the interview
with you, the CEO. You immediately notice that Mitchell currently works at
your good friend Cathy’s company. You check with your people to make sure
that they did not approach Mitchell first, and they assure you that Mitchell was
already looking and will go to another company if not yours. Now what?

At this point, you might be thinking, “If Mitchell is leaving, then logically my
friend Cathy should want him to go to my company rather than to a competitor


or a company with a CEO whom she doesn’t like.” Maybe Cathy will see it that
way, but probably not.

People generally leave companies when things are not going well, so you
should assume that Cathy is fighting for her company’s life. In this situation,
nothing will cut her deeper than losing a great employee, because she knows that
the other employees will see that as a leading indicator of the company’s demise.
Even more damaging for Cathy is the fact that her employees will perceive your
move as an act of betrayal—Cathy’s so-called friend is raiding her company.
They will think, “Cathy is such an ineffective CEO that she cannot even keep
her friends from hiring her people.” In this way, a logical issue quickly becomes
an emotional one.


You don’t want to lose Cathy as a friend, so you assure her that Mitchell is the
exception and that he came to you and that he will be the first and only one of
her employees that joins your company. Generally, this explanation will work
and Cathy will understand and appreciate the gesture. She will forgive, but rest
assured, she will not forget.

Her memory of Mitchell will be important, because Mitchell will be just the
first step in the demise of your relationship. Since Mitchell is a stellar hire,
Cathy’s other strong employees will likely call Mitchell to understand why he
left and where he is going. He will explain his reasoning and his reasons will be
compelling. And suddenly they will want to follow Mitchell’s path and join your
company, too. By the time you become aware of the situation, promises will
have been made to prospective employees who approached Mitchell and offers
may be out.

In each case, your employees will assure you that they were approached by
Cathy’s employees and not vice versa. They will point out that the candidates
have offers from other companies as well, so they will definitely leave and you
might as well benefit from their restlessness. Cathy’s managers will almost
certainly tell a different story. They will plead with her to get her friend to stop
raiding their stable of employees or else they will never be able to meet their
commitments. This will embarrass and enrage Cathy. In the end, social pressure
will trump all your brilliant countervailing logic.

Here’s an easy way to think about the dynamic. If your husband left you,
would you want your best friend to date him? He’s going to date somebody, so
wouldn’t you want your friend to have him? It seems logical, but this situation is
far from logical and you just lost one friend.


**SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?**


First, keep in mind that the employees are either extremely good or you probably
won’t want them in your company anyway. So, you will either be recruiting topnotch employees from your friend’s company or you will be adding mediocre
people. Do not assume the people you are taking will not be missed.

A good rule of thumb is my Reflexive Principle of Employee Raiding, which
states, “If you would be shocked and horrified if Company X hired several of
your employees, then you should not hire any of theirs.” The number of such
companies should be small and may very well be zero.

In order to avoid these sticky situations, many companies employ written or
unwritten policies that name companies where it is not okay to hire without CEO
(or senior executive) approval. With such a policy in place, you will be able to
give your friend one last chance to save their employee or to object prior to you
hiring them.

With that in mind, the best way to deal with these situations is openly and
transparently. Once you become aware of the conflict between hiring the
superstar employee and double-crossing your valued friend, you should get the
issue onto the table by informing the employee that you have an important
business relationship with his existing company and you will have to complete a
reference check with the CEO prior to extending the offer. Let him know that if
he does not want that to happen, then you will stop the process now and keep the
process to date confidential. By speaking with your friend before making the
hire, you will be able to better judge the relationship impact of hiring her
employee. In addition, you may avoid making a bad hire, as often candidates
who do well in interviews turn out to be bad employees.


**CLOSING THOUGHTS**


In the classic movie _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_, Clint Eastwood “The
Good” and Eli Wallach “The Ugly” are partners in crime. Wallach, a known
criminal, has a bounty on his head and the two of them run a scam to collect the
reward money. Eastwood turns Wallach in and collects the reward. Then
Wallach is sentenced to death by hanging. As Wallach sits on a horse, hands tied
behind his back and about to be hanged with a rope around his neck, Eastwood
shoots the rope from a distance and frees Wallach and they split the reward
money. This scheme works brilliantly, until one day Eastwood frees Wallach but
informs Wallach: “I don’t think you’ll ever be worth more than three thousand


dollars.” Wallach retorts, “What do you mean?” Eastwood informs him, “I
mean, our partnership is untied. Oh no, not you. You remain tied. I’ll keep the
money, and you can have the rope.” What follows is one of the great revenge
pursuits in motion picture history.

So, when you tell your CEO friend that you don’t think she’ll ever be worth
more than this employee, don’t expect to stay friends.


# **WHY IT’S HARD TO BRING BIG COMPANY** **EXECS INTO LITTLE COMPANIES**

So you’ve achieved product market fit and you are ready to start building the
company. The board encourages you to bring in some “been there, done that”
executives who will provide the right financial, sales, and marketing expertise to
help you transition from a world-class product to a world-class business. You
see a few candidates that you like, but the venture capitalist on the board says,
“You are undershooting. This is going to be a huge company. We can attract
better talent.” So you aim high and bring in a super-accomplished head of sales.
This guy has run huge organizations with thousands of employees. He has stellar
references and even looks the part. Your VC loves him, because he has an
awesome résumé.


**SIX MONTHS LATER . . .**


Fast-forward six months and everyone in the company is wondering why the
sales (or marketing or finance or product) guy who has produced nothing got
such a monster stock option package. Meanwhile, the people doing all the work
have much fewer options. Even worse than not getting your money’s worth, now
the company is in trouble, because you’ve been missing the numbers as your
super-expensive executive sits on his butt. What the frak just happened?

The most important thing to understand is that the job of a big company
executive is very different from the job of a small company executive. When I
was managing thousands of people at Hewlett-Packard after the sale of Opsware,
there was an incredible number of incoming demands on my time. Everyone
wanted a piece of me. Little companies wanted to partner with me or sell
themselves to me, people in my organization needed approvals, other business
units needed my help, customers wanted my attention, and so forth. As a result, I
spent most of my time optimizing and tuning the existing business. Most of the
work that I did was “incoming.” In fact, most skilled big company executives
will tell you that if you have more than three new initiatives in a quarter, you are
trying to do too much. As a result, big company executives tend to be interrupt

driven.


In contrast, when you are a startup executive, nothing happens unless you
make it happen. In the early days of a company, you have to take eight to ten
new initiatives a day or the company will stand still. There is no inertia that’s
putting the company in motion. Without massive input from you, the company
will stay at rest.


**SO WHAT HAPPENS?**


Once you hire one of these big company executives, there are two dangerous
mismatches that you will face:


**1.** **Rhythm mismatch** Your executive has been conditioned to wait for the
emails to come in, wait for the phone to ring, and wait for the meetings to
get scheduled. In your company, he will be waiting a long time. If your new
executive waits (as per his training), your other employees will become
suspicious. You’ll hear things like “What does that guy do all day long?”
and “Why did he get so many options?”


**2.** **Skill set mismatch** Running a large organization requires very different
skills than creating and building an organization. When you run a large
organization, you tend to become very good at tasks such as complex
decision-making, prioritization, organizational design, process
improvement, and organizational communication. When you are building
an organization, there is no organization to design, there are no processes to
improve, and communicating with the organization is simple. On the other
hand, you have to be very adept at running a high-quality hiring process,
have terrific domain expertise (you are personally responsible for quality
control), know how to create process from scratch, and be extremely
creative about initiating new directions and tasks.


**HOW CAN YOU STOP THINGS FROM GOING HORRIBLY**


**WRONG?**


There are two key steps to avoiding disaster:


**1.** Screen for devastating mismatches in the interview process.


**2.** Take integration as seriously as interviewing.


**SCREEN FOR MISMATCHES**


How do you tell if the rhythm mismatch or the skill set mismatch will be too
much to overcome? Here are some interview questions that I found very helpful:


**What will you do in your first month on the job?**

Beware of answers that overemphasize learning. This may indicate that the
candidate thinks there is more to learn about your organization than there
actually is. More specifically, he may think that your organization is as complex
as his current organization.

Beware of any indication that the candidate needs to be interrupt-driven rather
than setting the pace personally. The interrupts will never come.

Look for candidates who come in with more new initiatives than you think are
possible. This is a good sign.


**How will your new job differ from your current job?**

Look for self-awareness of the differences here. If they have the experience in
what you need, they will be articulate on this point.

Beware of candidates who think that too much of their experience is
immediately transferable. It may pay off down the line, but likely not tomorrow.


**Why do you want to join a small company?**

Beware of equity being the primary motivation. One percent of nothing is
nothing. That’s something that big company executives sometimes have a hard
time understanding.

It’s much better if they want to be more creative. The most important
difference between big and small companies is the amount of time running
versus creating. A desire to do more creating is the right reason to want to join

your company.


**AGGRESSIVELY INTEGRATE THE CANDIDATE ONCE ON**


**BOARD**


Perhaps the most critical step is integration. You should plan to spend a huge
amount of time integrating any new executive. Here are some things to keep in
mind:


_Force them to create._ Give them monthly, weekly, and even daily


objectives to make sure that they produce immediately. The rest of the
company will be watching and this will be critical to their assimilation.


_Make sure that they “get it.”_ Content-free executives have no value in
startups. Every executive must understand the product, the technology, the
customers, and the market. Force your newbie to learn these things.
Consider scheduling a daily meeting with your new executive. Require
them to bring a comprehensive set of questions about everything they heard
that day but did not completely understand. Answer those questions in
depth; start with first principles. Bring them up to speed fast. If they don’t
have any questions, consider firing them. If in thirty days you don’t feel
that they are coming up to speed, definitely fire them.


_Put them in the mix._ Make sure that they initiate contact and interaction
with their peers and other key people in the organization. Give them a list
of people they need to know and learn from. Once they’ve done that,
require a report from them on what they learned from each person.


**FINAL THOUGHTS**


Nothing will accelerate your company’s development like hiring someone who
has experience building a very similar company at larger scale. However, doing
so can be fraught with peril. Make sure to pay attention to the important leading
indicators of success and failure.


# **HIRING EXECUTIVES: IF YOU’VE NEVER** **DONE THE JOB, HOW DO YOU HIRE** **SOMEBODY GOOD?**

The biggest difference between being a great functional manager and being a
great general manager—and particularly a great CEO—is that as a general
manager, you must hire and manage people who are far more competent at their
jobs than you would be at their jobs. In fact, often you will have to hire and
manage people to do jobs that you have never done. How many CEOs have been
head of HR, engineering, sales, marketing, finance, and legal? Probably none.

So, with no experience, how do you hire someone good?


**STEP 1: KNOW WHAT YOU WANT**


Step 1 is definitely the most important step in the process and also the one that
gets skipped most often. As the great self-help coach Tony Robbins says, “If you
don’t know what you want, the chances that you’ll get it are extremely low.” If
you have never done the job, how do you know what to want?

First, you must realize how ignorant you are and resist the temptation to
educate yourself simply by interviewing candidates. While the interview process
can be highly educational, using that as the sole information source is dangerous.
Doing so will make you susceptible to the following traps:


**Hiring on look and feel** It may seem silly to think that anyone would
hire an executive based on the way they look and sound in an interview, but
in my experience, look and feel are the top criteria for most executive
searches. When you combine a CEO who doesn’t know what she wants and
a board of directors that hasn’t thought much about the hire, what do you
think the criteria will be?


**Looking for someone out of central casting** If I had followed this path,
I would never have hired Mark Cranney and you probably would not be
reading this now. This wrongheaded approach is the moral equivalent of


looking for the Platonic ideal for a head of sales. You imagine what the
perfect sales executive might be like, and then you attempt to match realworld candidates to your model. This is a bad idea for several reasons. First,
you are not hiring an abstract executive to work at an arbitrary company.
You must hire the right person for your company at this particular point in
time. The head of sales at Oracle in 2010 would likely have failed in 1989.
The VP of engineering at Apple might be exactly the wrong choice for
Foursquare. The details and the specifics matter. Second, your imaginary
model is almost certainly wrong. What is your basis for creating this
model? Finally, it will be incredibly difficult to educate an interview team
on such an abstract set of criteria. As a result, everybody will be looking for
something different.


**Valuing lack of weakness rather than strength** The more experience
you have, the more you realize that there is something seriously wrong with
every employee in your company (including you). Nobody is perfect.


The very best way to know what you want is to act in the role. Not just in title,
but in real action. In my career, I’ve been acting VP of HR, CFO, and VP of
sales. Often CEOs resist acting in functional roles, because they worry that they
lack the appropriate knowledge. This worry is precisely why you should act—to
get the appropriate knowledge. Indeed, acting is really the only way to get all the
knowledge that you need to make the hire, because you are looking for the right
executive for your company today, not a generic executive.

In addition to acting in the role, it helps greatly to bring in domain experts. If
you know a great head of sales, interview them first and learn what they think
made them great. Figure out which of those strengths most directly match the
needs of your company. If possible, include the domain expert in the interview
process. However, be aware that the domain expert only has part of the
knowledge necessary to make the hire. Specifically, she has very little
knowledge of your company, how it works, and what its needs are. Therefore,
you cannot defer the decision to the domain expert.

Finally, be clear in your own mind about your expectations for this person
upon joining your company. What will this person do in the first thirty days?
What do you expect their motivation to be for joining? Do you want them to
build a large organization right away or hire only one or two people over the
next year?


**STEP 2. RUN A PROCESS THAT FIGURES OUT THE RIGHT**


**MATCH**


In order to find the right executive, you must now take the knowledge that you
have gathered and translate it into a process that yields the right candidate. Here
is the process that I like to use.


**Write down the strengths you want and the weaknesses that you are willing**
**to tolerate.**


In order to ensure completeness, I find it useful to include criteria from the
following subdivisions when hiring executives:


Will the executive be world-class at running the function?


Is the executive outstanding operationally?


Will the executive make a major contribution to the strategic direction of
the company? This is the “are they smart enough?” criterion.


Will the executive be an effective member of the team? _Effective_ is the
key word. It’s possible for an executive to be well liked and totally
ineffective with respect to the other members of the team. It’s also possible
for an executive to be highly effective and profoundly influential while
being totally despised. The latter is far better.


These functions do not carry equal weight for all positions. Make sure that
you balance them appropriately. Generally, operational excellence is far more
important for a VP of engineering or a VP of sales than for a VP of marketing or
a CFO.


**Develop questions that test for the criteria (see the appendix).**


This effort is important even if you never ask the candidate any of the preprepared questions. By writing down questions that test for what you want, you
will get to a level of specificity that will be extremely difficult to achieve
otherwise. (See the appendix for an example of questions that I wrote for
running the enterprise sales function and operational excellence.) Assemble an
appropriate interview team and conduct the interviews.


**Assemble the interview team.**


In assembling the team, you should keep two questions in mind:


**1.** Who will best help you figure out whether the candidate meets the
criteria? These may be internal or external people. They can be board
members, other executives, or just experts.


**2.** Who do you need to support the decision once the executive is on board?
This group is just as important as the first. No matter how great an
executive is, they will have trouble succeeding if the people around them
sabotage everything they do. The best way to avoid that is to understand
any potential issues before the person is hired.


Clearly, some people will be in both groups one and two. The opinions of both
groups will be very important: Group one will help you determine the best
candidate and group two will help you gauge how easily each candidate will
integrate into your company. Generally, it’s best to have group two interview
finalist candidates only.

Next, assign questions to interviewers based on their talents. Specifically,
make sure that the interviewer who asks the questions deeply understands what a
good answer will sound like.

As you conduct the interviews, be sure to discuss each interview with the
interviewer. Use this time to drive to a common understanding of the criteria, so
that you will get the best information possible.


**Backdoor and front-door references.**


For the final candidates, it’s critically important that the CEO conduct the
reference checks herself. The references need to be checked against the same
hiring criteria that you tested for during the interview process. Backdoor
reference checks (checks from people who know the candidate, but were not
referred by the candidate) can be an extremely useful way to get an unbiased
view. However, do not discount the front-door references. While they clearly
have committed to giving a positive reference (or they wouldn’t be on the list),
you are not looking for positive or negative with them. You are looking for fit
with your criteria. Often, the front-door references will know the candidate best
and will be quite helpful in this respect.


**STEP 3: MAKE A LONELY DECISION**


Despite many people being involved in the process, the ultimate decision should
be made solo. Only the CEO has comprehensive knowledge of the criteria, the
rationale for the criteria, all of the feedback from interviewers and references,
and the relative importance of the various stakeholders. Consensus decisions
about executives almost always sway the process away from strength and toward
lack of weakness. It’s a lonely job, but somebody has to do it.


# **WHEN EMPLOYEES MISINTERPRET** **MANAGERS**

Early on at Loudcloud, many people would do crazy things backed up by “Ben
said.” Often I didn’t say any of it, but I definitely didn’t say it in the way they
used it. The management principles I share here are connected to many of those
experiences.

When I ran Opsware, we had the nonlinear quarter problem also known
affectionately as the hockey stick. The hockey stick refers to the shape of the
revenue graph over the course of a quarter. Our hockey stick was so bad that one
quarter, we booked 90 percent of our new bookings on the last day of the
quarter. Sales patterns like this make it difficult to plan the business and are
particularly harrowing when you are, as we were, a public company.

Naturally, I was determined to straighten out the hockey stick and bring some
sanity to the business. I designed an incentive for salespeople to close deals in
the first two months of the quarter by issuing bonuses for deals in those months.
As a result, the next quarter became slightly more linear, and slightly smaller
than anticipated—deals just moved from the third month to the first two of the
following quarter.

When I ran a large engineering group at Netscape, I measured one of our
engineering products on schedule, quality, and features. The team shipped a
product with all the required features, on time and with very few bugs.
Unfortunately, the product was mediocre, because none of the features were that

great.

When I was at HP, we ran all the businesses by the numbers with extremely
strict revenue and margin targets. Some divisions made their numbers, but did so
by underfunding R&D. They dramatically weakened their long-term competitive
position and set themselves up for future disaster.

In all three cases, managers got what we asked for, but not what we wanted.
How did this happen? Let’s take a look.


**FLATTENING OUT THE HOCKEY STICK: THE WRONG GOAL**


In retrospect, I should never have asked the team to flatten the quarters. If that is
what I wanted, I had to be willing to—at least temporarily—accept smaller
quarters. We had a fixed number of salespeople who were maximizing the size
of each quarter. In order to deliver linear quarters, they had to modify their
behavior and adjust their priorities. Unfortunately, I liked the old priority of
maximizing revenue better.

Given the situation, I was actually pretty lucky. Sun Tzu, in his classic work
_The Art of War_, warns that giving the team a task that it cannot possibly perform
is called crippling the army. In my case, I did not cripple the team, but I screwed
up my priorities. The right thing to do would have been to make the hard
decision up front, about what was more important, maximizing each quarter or
increasing predictability. The instruction only made sense if the answer was the
second one.


**FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON THE NUMBERS**


In the second example, I managed the team to a set of numbers that did not fully
capture what I wanted. I wanted a great product that customers would love with
high quality and on time—in that order.

Unfortunately, the metrics that I set did not capture those priorities. At a basic
level, metrics are incentives. By measuring quality, features, and schedule and
discussing them at every staff meeting, my people focused intensely on those
metrics to the exclusion of other goals. The metrics did not describe the real
goals and I distracted the team as a result.

Interestingly, I see this same problem play out in many consumer Internet
startups. I often see teams that maniacally focus on their metrics around
customer acquisition and retention. This usually works well for customer
acquisition, but not so well for retention. Why?

For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in
enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the
metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete
management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention
metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user
experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in
a great product. It’s important to supplement a great product vision with a strong
discipline around the metrics, but if you substitute metrics for product vision,
you will not get what you want.


**MANAGING STRICTLY BY NUMBERS IS LIKE PAINTING BY**


**NUMBERS**


Some things that you want to encourage will be quantifiable, and some will not.
If you report on the quantitative goals and ignore the qualitative ones, you won’t
get the qualitative goals, which may be the most important ones. Management
purely by numbers is sort of like painting by numbers—it’s strictly for amateurs.

At HP, the company wanted high earnings now and in the future. By focusing
entirely on the numbers, HP got them now by sacrificing the future.

Note that there were many numbers as well as more qualitative goals that
would have helped:


Was our competitive win rate increasing or declining?


Was customer satisfaction rising or falling?


What did our own engineers think of the products?


By managing the organization as though it were a black box, some divisions at
HP optimized the present at the expense of their downstream competitiveness.
The company rewarded managers for achieving short-term objectives in a
manner that was bad for the company. It would have been better to take into
account the white box. The white box goes beyond the numbers and gets into
how the organization produced the numbers. It penalizes managers who sacrifice
the future for the short term and rewards those who invest in the future even if

that investment cannot be easily measured.


**CLOSING THOUGHT**


It is easy to see that there are many ways for leaders to be misinterpreted. To get
things right, you must recognize that anything you measure automatically creates
a set of employee behaviors. Once you determine the result you want, you need
to test the description of the result against the employee behaviors that the
description will likely create. Otherwise, the side-effect behaviors may be worse
than the situation you were trying to fix.
