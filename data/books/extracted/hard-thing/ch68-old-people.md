# **OLD PEOPLE**

Your startup is going well and as your business expands you hear the dreaded
words from someone on your board: “You need to hire some senior people.
Some real ‘been there, done that’ executives to help you get the company to the
next level.” Really? Is now the time? If so, where do I begin? And once I get
them, what do I do with them? And how will I know if they are doing a good
job?

The first question you might ask is “Why do I need senior people at all?
Won’t they just ruin the culture with their fancy clothes, political ambitions, and
need to go home to see their families?” To some extent, the answer to all of
those may be “yes,” which is why this question must be taken quite seriously.
However, bringing in the right kind of experience at the right time can mean the
difference between bankruptcy and glory.

Let’s go back to the first part of the question. Why hire a senior person? The
short answer is _time_ . As a technology startup, from the day you start until your
last breath, you will be in a furious race against time. No technology startup has
a long shelf life. Even the best ideas become terrible ideas after a certain age.
How would Facebook go if Zuckerberg started it last week? At Netscape, we
went public when we were fifteen months old. Had we started six months later,
we would have been late to a market with thirty-seven other browser companies.
Even if nobody beats you to the punch, no matter how beautiful your dream
most employees will lose faith after the first five or six years of not achieving it.
Hiring someone who has already done what you are trying to do can radically
speed up your time to success.

But CEO, beware: Hiring senior people into a startup is kind of like an athlete
taking performance-enhancing drugs. If all goes well, you will achieve
incredible new heights. If all goes wrong, you will start degenerating from the
inside out.


In order to make all go well, if you are considering hiring a senior person do
not chase an abstract rationale like “adult supervision” or “becoming a real
company.” A weak definition of what you are looking for will lead to a bad
outcome. The proper reason to hire a senior person is _to acquire knowledge and_


_experience in a specific area_ .

For example, as a technical founder, you probably do not have terrific
knowledge of how to build a worldwide sales channel, how to create an
invincible brand, or how to identify and negotiate ecosystem-altering business
development deals. Acquiring a world-class senior person can dramatically
accelerate your company’s ability to succeed in these areas.

One good test for determining whether to go with outside experience versus
internal promotion is to figure out whether you value inside knowledge or
outside knowledge more for the position. For example, for engineering managers
the comprehensive knowledge of the code base and engineering team is usually
more important and difficult to acquire than knowledge of how to run scalable
engineering organizations. As a result, you might very well value the knowledge
of your own organization more than that of the outside world.

In hiring someone to sell your product to large enterprises, the opposite is
true. Knowing how your target customers think and operate, knowing their
cultural tendencies, understanding how to recruit and measure the right people in
the right regions of the world to maximize your sales—these things turn out to
be far more valuable than knowing your own company’s product and culture.
This is why when the head of engineering gets promoted from within, she often
succeeds. When the head of sales gets promoted from within, she almost always
fails. Asking yourself, “Do I value internal or external knowledge more for this
position?” will help you determine whether to go for experience or youth.


**ONCE THEY ARRIVE**


Bringing senior people on board can be fraught with peril, as I have outlined in
the sections “Why It’s Hard to Bring Big Company Execs into Little
Companies” and “Hiring Executives: If You’ve Never Done the Job, How Do
You Hire Somebody Good?” (see pages 119 and 124) _._

Equally difficult is managing them effectively once they come on board.
Senior people pose several important challenges:


_They come with their own culture._ They will bring the habits, the
communication style, and values from the company they grew up in. It’s
very unlikely these will match your environment exactly.


_They will know how to work the system._ Because senior people come
from larger environments, they usually develop the skills to navigate and be


effective in those environments. These skills may seem political and
unusual in your environment.


_You don’t know the job as well as they do._ In fact, you are hiring them
precisely because you don’t know how to do the job. So how do you hold
them accountable for doing a good job?


In order to prevent the internal degeneration mentioned earlier, it’s important
to be aware of the above issues and then employ appropriate countermeasures to
make sure they don’t metastasize.

First, you should demand cultural compliance. It’s fine that people come from
other company cultures. It’s true that some of those cultures will have properties
that are superior to your own. But this is your company, your culture, and your
way of doing business. Do not be intimidated by experience on this issue; stick
to your guns and stick to your culture. If you want to expand your culture to
incorporate some of the new thinking, that’s fine, but do so explicitly—do not
drift. Next, watch for politically motivated tactics and do not tolerate them.

Perhaps most important, set a high and clear standard for performance. If you
want to have a world-class company, you must make sure that the people on
your staff—be they young or old—are world-class. It is not nearly enough that
someone on your staff can do the job better than you can, because you are
incompetent at the job—that’s why you hired them in the first place.

Be careful not to set a low bar because you have not done the work to know
what good is. For example, I’ve seen many a young CEO excited about her
company’s competency in marketing and PR because she got a bunch of positive
stories on her launch. That’s not a high PR standard. Anybody can get reporters
to write nice things about a sweet, cuddly baby of a company. Only world-class
PR people can deal with gangly, pimple-ridden, teenage companies. World-class
PR people can turn around negative stories. World-class PR people can turn
chicken shit into chicken salad. Turning chicken shit into chicken salad requires
long-term, trusted relationships, deep know-how, and the confidence to make
use of both appropriately. PR kids don’t have any of the three.

One excellent way to develop a high standard is to interview people who you
see doing a great job in their field. Find out what their standard is and add it to
your own. Once you determine a high yet achievable performance bar, hold your
executive to that high standard even if you have no idea how they might achieve
it. It’s not your job to figure out how to create an incredible brand, tilt the
playing field by cutting a transformational deal, or achieve a sales goal that


nobody thought possible—that’s what you are paying them to do. That’s why
you hired them.

Finally, you’ll need your new executive to be more than just a goal achiever.
She will need to be well rounded and part of the team. Bill Campbell developed
an excellent methodology for measuring executives in a balanced way that will
help you achieve this. He breaks performance down into four distinct areas:


**1.** **Results against objectives** Once you’ve set a high standard, it will be
straightforward to measure your executive against that standard.


**2.** **Management** Even if an executive does a superb job achieving her
goals, that doesn’t mean she is building a strong and loyal team. It’s
important to understand how well she is managing, even if she is hitting her
goals.


**3.** **Innovation** It’s quite possible for an executive to hit her goal for the
quarter by ignoring the future. For example, a great way for an engineering
manager to hit her goals for features and dates is by building a horrible
architecture, which won’t even support the next release. This is why you
must look beyond the black-box results and into the sausage factory to see
how things get made.


**4.** **Working with peers** This may not be intuitive at first, but executives
must be effective at communicating, supporting, and getting what they need
from the other people on your staff. Evaluate them along this dimension.


**AW, MAN, YOU SOLD YOUR SOUL**


Hiring the first senior people into your company may feel like selling your soul,
and if you are not careful, you may well end up selling the soul of your
company. But if you want to make something from nothing, you have to take
risks and you have to win your race against time. This means acquiring the very
best talent, knowledge, and experience even if it requires dealing with some
serious age diversity.
