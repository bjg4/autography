# **THE STRUGGLE**

Every entrepreneur starts her company with a clear vision for success. You will
create an amazing environment and hire the smartest people to join you.
Together you will build a beautiful product that delights customers and makes
the world just a little bit better. It’s going to be absolutely awesome.

Then, after working night and day to make your vision a reality, you wake up
to find that things did not go as planned. Your company did not unfold like the
Jack Dorsey keynote that you listened to when you started. Your product has
issues that will be very hard to fix. The market isn’t quite where it was supposed
to be. Your employees are losing confidence and some of them have quit. Some
of the ones who quit were quite smart and have the remaining ones wondering if
staying makes sense. You are running low on cash and your venture capitalist
tells you that it will be difficult to raise money given the impending European
economic catastrophe. You lose a competitive battle. You lose a loyal customer.
You lose a great employee. The walls start closing in. Where did you go wrong?
Why didn’t your company perform as envisioned? Are you good enough to do
this? As your dreams turn into nightmares, you find yourself in _the Struggle_ .


**ABOUT THE STRUGGLE**


“Life is struggle.”

# **—KARL MARX**


The Struggle is when you wonder why you started the company in the first
place.

The Struggle is when people ask you why you don’t quit and you don’t know
the answer.


The Struggle is when your employees think you are lying and you think they
may be right.

The Struggle is when food loses its taste.
The Struggle is when you don’t believe you should be CEO of your company.


The Struggle is when you know that you are in over your head and you know
that you cannot be replaced. The Struggle is when everybody thinks you are an
idiot, but nobody will fire you. The Struggle is where self-doubt becomes selfhatred.


The Struggle is when you are having a conversation with someone and you
can’t hear a word that they are saying because all you can hear is the Struggle.

The Struggle is when you want the pain to stop. The Struggle is unhappiness.
The Struggle is when you go on vacation to feel better and you feel worse.
The Struggle is when you are surrounded by people and you are all alone. The
Struggle has no mercy.

The Struggle is the land of broken promises and crushed dreams. The Struggle
is a cold sweat. The Struggle is where your guts boil so much that you feel like
you are going to spit blood.

The Struggle is not failure, but it causes failure. Especially if you are weak.
Always if you are weak.

Most people are not strong enough.
Every great entrepreneur from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg went through
the Struggle and struggle they did, so you are not alone. But that does not mean
that you will make it. You may not make it. That is why it is the Struggle.

The Struggle is where greatness comes from.


**SOME STUFF THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HELP**


There is no answer to the Struggle, but here are some things that helped me:


_Don’t put it all on your shoulders._ It is easy to think that the things that
bother you will upset your people more. That’s not true. The opposite is
true. Nobody takes the losses harder than the person most responsible.
Nobody feels it more than you. You won’t be able to share every burden,
but share every burden that you can. Get the maximum number of brains on
the problems even if the problems represent existential threats. When I ran
Opsware and we were losing too many competitive deals, I called an all
hands and told the whole company that we were getting our asses kicked,
and if we didn’t stop the bleeding, we were going to die. Nobody blinked.
The team rallied, built a winning product, and saved my sorry ass.


_This is not checkers; this is motherfuckin’ chess._ Technology businesses
tend to be extremely complex. The underlying technology moves, the


competition moves, the market moves, the people move. As a result, like
playing three-dimensional chess on _Star Trek_, there is always a move. You
think you have no moves? How about taking your company public with $2
million in trailing revenue and 340 employees, with a plan to do $75
million in revenue the next year? I made that move. I made it in 2001,
widely regarded as the worst time ever for a technology company to go
public. I made it with six weeks of cash left. There is always a move.


_Play long enough and you might get lucky._ In the technology game,
tomorrow looks nothing like today. If you survive long enough to see
tomorrow, it may bring you the answer that seems so impossible today.


_Don’t take it personally._ The predicament that you are in is probably all
your fault. You hired the people. You made the decisions. But you knew the
job was dangerous when you took it. Everybody makes mistakes. Every
CEO makes thousands of mistakes. Evaluating yourself and giving yourself
an F doesn’t help.


_Remember that this is what separates the women from the girls._ If you
want to be great, this is the challenge. If you don’t want to be great, then
you never should have started a company.


**THE END**


When you are in the Struggle, nothing is easy and nothing feels right. You have
dropped into the abyss and you may never get out. In my own experience, but
for some unexpected luck and help, I would have been lost.

So to all of you in it, may you find strength and may you find peace.
