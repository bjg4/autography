# **ONES AND TWOS**

Jim Collins, in his bestselling book _Good to Great_, demonstrates through
massive research and comprehensive analysis that when it comes to CEO
succession, internal candidates dramatically outperform external candidates. The
core reason is knowledge. Knowledge of technology, prior decisions, culture,
personnel, and more tends to be far more difficult to acquire than the skills
required to manage a larger organization. Collins does not, however, explain
why internal candidates sometimes fail as well. I will attempt to do so here. I
will focus the discussion on two core skills for running an organization: First,
knowing what to do. Second, getting the company to do what you know. While
being a great CEO requires both skills, most CEOs tend to be more comfortable
with one or the other. I call managers who are happier setting the direction of the
company _Ones_ and those who more enjoy making the company perform at the
highest level _Twos._


**WHAT ONES LIKE AND DON’T LIKE**


Ones like spending most of their time gathering information from a broad variety
of sources, from employees to customers to competitors. Ones love making
decisions. Although they prefer to have comprehensive information when they
make a decision, they comfortably make decisions with very little information
when necessary. Ones have great strategic minds and enjoy nothing more than a
good game of eight-dimensional chess against their best competitors.

Ones sometimes get bored with many of the important execution details
required to run a company, such as process design, goal setting, structured
accountability, training, and performance management.

Most founding CEOs tend to be Ones. When founding CEOs fail, a significant
reason is that they never invested the time to be competent enough in the Two
tasks to direct those activities effectively. The resulting companies become too
chaotic to reach their full potential and the CEO ends up being replaced.


**WHAT TWOS LIKE AND DON’T LIKE**


Twos, on the other hand, thoroughly enjoy the process of making the company
run well. They insist upon super-clear goals and strongly prefer not to change
goals or direction unless absolutely necessary.

Twos like to participate in strategic discussions but often have difficulty with
the strategic thinking process itself. Where a One might be perfectly comfortable
spending one day a week reading, studying, and thinking, doing so would make
a Two very nervous, because it would not feel like work to them. A Two would
get antsy at the thought of all the processes that might be improved, people who
might be held accountable to achieving the standard, or sales calls that could be
made while he was wasting time just thinking about strategy.

Big decisions worry Twos much more than they worry Ones. Circumstances
often force both Ones and Twos to make critical decisions with insufficient data,
but Ones generally feel fine about doing that and do not get overly anxious about
the consequences. Twos, by contrast, can become highly agitated about such
things and sometimes overcomplicate the decision-making process in order to
provide a false feeling of thoroughness about the choice.

CEOs who are Twos, despite their love of action, can sometimes bring
decision making in a company to a halt.


**YOU NEED BOTH CHARACTERISTICS TO BE A GOOD CEO**


While people tend to be Ones or Twos, with discipline and hard work natural
Twos can be competent at One tasks and Ones can be competent at Two tasks. If
a CEO ignores the dimension of management she doesn’t like, she generally
fails. Ones end up in chaos and Twos fail to pivot when necessary.


**FUNCTIONAL ONES**


Often Two executives act as Ones for their functions, but Twos as members of
the executive team. For example, the head of sales might easily make all the
decisions that are local to the sales organization but prefer to take direction with
respect to the overall company plans. This is the best kind of multilayer
leadership possible, because directions are clear and decisions are made rapidly
with precision.


**HOW ORGANIZATIONS TEND TO BE CONSTRUCTED**


The primary purpose of the organizational hierarchy in a company is decision

making efficiency. It follows that most CEOs tend to be Ones. If the person at
the top of the decision-making hierarchy doesn’t like making extremely complex
decisions, the company’s processes will be slow and unwieldy.

If you’re a One, it can be counterproductive to have another One on your staff,
because she will want to set her own direction rather than follow yours. This
kind of strategic contention can confuse the organization and send employees in
opposing directions. As a result, many great One CEOs employ primarily Twos
and Functional Ones on their staff.


**WHAT HAPPENS AT SUCCESSION?**


This brings us to the question of succession. Since most organizations are run by
Ones and have a team of Twos (sometimes Functional Ones) reporting to them,
replacing the CEO can be extremely tricky. Do you promote someone from the
executive staff even though they are likely a Two? Microsoft did this in 2000
when they replaced Bill Gates, a prototypical One, with Steve Ballmer, literally
his number two. Or do you reach deep into the organization and pull a One from
a level lower where they are likely to exist? General Electric famously did this
with Jack Welch in 1981. It was an incredibly bold move by GE—not only did
they promote an executive two levels down in the organizational chart past all of
his superiors, but in doing so they named the youngest CEO in the history of GE.
It’s difficult for most board members to even conceive of the possibility that
there is a One deep in the organization who is more qualified to run the company
than anyone on the executive staff.

Both methods can be problematic. The first approach leaves the company in
the charge of a Two. As the company faces forks in the road, decision making
may slow down and the company may lose its edge. In addition, the natural Ones
(in Microsoft’s case, stellar executives such as Paul Maritz and Brad Silverberg)
will eventually leave.

In scenario two, by promoting someone past everyone on the executive team
and making them CEO (as GE did), you will likely cause massive turnover of
the executive staff. In fact, in very short order, almost none of the original GE
executives remained under Welch. In a diversified conglomerate like GE, this
kind of rough transition is possible. For companies in the highly dynamic
technology business, the super-high-turnover scenario is more dangerous.


**THE BIG CONCLUSION**


The big conclusion will be a big disappointment for those looking for an answer.
The answer is there is no easy answer. CEO transition is hard. If you bring
people in from the outside, you lower your chances for success. If you promote
from within, you must deal with the One-Two phenomenon. Ideally, you’ll
promote a One and the rest of the executive team will be glad you did. Too bad
things are rarely ideal.
