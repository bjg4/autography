# **DEMOTING A LOYAL FRIEND**

When I started Loudcloud, I hired the best people I knew—people whom I
respected, trusted, and liked. Like me, many of them did not have deep
experience in the jobs that I gave them, but they worked night and day to learn,
and they made great contributions to the company. Nevertheless, the day came
when I needed to hire someone else, someone with more experience, to run the
function that I had previously entrusted to my loyal friend. Damn. How do you
do that?


**SHOULD YOU DO IT AT ALL?**


The first question that always comes to mind is “Do I really need to do this?
Who could I possibly hire who will work this hard and bleed the company colors
like this?” Sadly, if you’re asking the question, you very likely already know the
answer. If you need to build a worldwide sales organization, your buddy who did
the first few deals is almost certainly not the best choice. As hard as it may be,
you need to take a Confucian approach. You must consider first all of the other
employees and second your friend. The good of the individual must be sacrificed
for the good of the whole.


**HOW DO YOU BREAK THE NEWS?**


Once you make the decision, breaking the news will not be easy. It’s important
to consider two deep emotions your friend will feel:


**Embarrassment** Do not underestimate what a large factor this will be in
his thinking. All of his friends, relatives, and colleagues know his current
position. They know how hard he’s worked and how much he’s sacrificed
for the company. How will he possibly explain to them that he will no
longer be part of the executive team?


**Betrayal** Your friend will undoubtedly feel something like this: I’ve been
there from the beginning, I’ve worked side by side with you. How could


you do this? It’s not like you’re perfect in your job, either. How can you be
so comfortable selling me out?


Those are some powerful emotions, so get ready for an intense discussion.
Ironically, the key to an emotional discussion is to take the emotion out of it. To
do that, you must be very clear in your mind about what you’ve decided and
what you want to do.

The most important thing to decide is that you really want to do this. If you
walk into a demotion discussion with an open decision, you will walk out with a
mess: a mess of a situation and a mess of a relationship. As part of the decision,
you must get comfortable with the thought that the employee may quit the
company. Given the intense emotions he will feel, there is no guarantee that he
will want to stay. If you cannot afford to lose him, you cannot make this change.

Finally, you must decide the best role for him in your company. The obvious
thing is to have him continue under his new boss, but this may not be the best
thing for him, his boss, or his career. Your loyal employee will continue to have
lots of knowledge about your company, competition, customers, and market that
his new boss lacks. On the one hand, this can be a good thing—he can help get
the new boss up to speed. On the other hand, when mixed with the intense
emotions of embarrassment and betrayal, you might end up with a sabotage
cocktail.


Another problem with this approach is that from a career path perspective
there is no way to paint a picture of him reporting to his new boss as anything
but a demotion. An alternative, if appropriate, would be to move him to another
area of the company where his skills, talent, and knowledge will help. This kind
of move will give him a chance to develop a new set of skills and help the
company while he’s doing it. For young employees, getting experience in
different areas can be highly valuable.

Sadly, this option may not be a silver bullet. He might not want to work in
another job; he might be hell-bent on keeping his current job, so prepare for that
as well.


Once you’ve decided to hire someone above your friend and decided on the
alternatives that you’d like to offer him, you can have the conversation. Keep in
mind that you cannot let him keep his old job, but you can be fair and you can be
honest. Some keys to doing that:


_Use appropriate language._ Make clear with your language that you’ve


decided. As previously discussed, use phrases like “I have decided” rather
than “I think” or “I’d like.” By doing this, you will avoid putting the
employee in the awkward position of wondering whether he should lobby
for his old job. You can’t tell him what he wants to hear, but you can be
honest.


_Admit reality._ If you are a founder-CEO like I was, it probably won’t be
lost on the employee that you are just as underskilled for your job as he is
for his. Don’t dodge this fact. In fact, admit that if you were a more
experienced CEO, you might be able to develop him into the role, but two
people who don’t know what they are doing is a recipe for failure.


_Acknowledge the contributions._ If you want him to stay in the company,
you should say that and make it crystal clear that you want to help him
develop his career and contribute to the company. Let him know that you
appreciate what he’s done and that your decision results from a forwardlooking examination of what the company needs, not a review of his past
performance. The best way to do this, if appropriate, is to couple the
demotion with an _increase_ in compensation. Doing so will let him know
that he’s both appreciated and valued going forward.


Through all of this, keep in mind that it is what it is and nothing you can say
will change that or stop it from being deeply upsetting. Your goal should not be
to take the sting out of it, but to be honest, clear, and effective. Your friend may
not appreciate that in the moment, but he will appreciate it over time.
