# **LEAD BULLETS**

Early in my tenure at Netscape, when we realized that Microsoft’s new Web
server had every feature that ours had, but was also five times faster and was to
be given away for free, I immediately went to work trying to pivot our server
product line to something that we could sell for money. The late, great Mike
Homer and I worked furiously on a set of partnerships and acquisitions that
would broaden the product line and surround the Web server with enough
functionality that we would be able to survive the attack.

I excitedly reviewed the plan with my engineering counterpart, Bill Turpin,
who looked at me as though I were a little kid who had much to learn. Bill was a
longtime veteran of battling Microsoft from his time at Borland and understood
what I was trying to do, but he was not persuaded. He said, “Ben, those silver
bullets that you and Mike are looking for are fine and good, but our Web server
is five times slower. There is no silver bullet that’s going to fix that. No, we are
going to have to use a lot of lead bullets.” Oh snap.

As a result of Bill’s advice, we focused our engineering team on fixing the
performance issues while working on the other things in the background. We
eventually beat Microsoft’s performance and grew the server line to become a
$400 million business, and we would never have done it without those lead
bullets.


I carried that lesson with me for many years. Six years later, when I was CEO
of Opsware, our toughest competitor, BladeLogic, started to consistently beat us
in large deals. We were a public company, and the losses were all too visible. To
make matters worse, we needed to win those deals in order to beat Wall Street’s
projections, so the company felt tremendous pressure. Many of our smartest
people came to me with ideas for avoiding the battle:


“Let’s build a lightweight version of the product and go down-market.”


“Let’s acquire a company with a simpler architecture.”


“Let’s focus on service providers.”


All these approaches reinforced to me was that we weren’t facing a market
problem. The customers were buying; they just weren’t buying _our_ product. This
was not a time to pivot. So I said the same thing to every one of them: “There
are no silver bullets for this, only lead bullets.” They did not want to hear that,
but it made things clear: We had to build a better product. There was no other
way out. No window, no hole, no escape hatch, no back door. We had to go
through the front door and deal with the big, ugly guy blocking it. Lead bullets.

After nine months of hard work on an extremely rugged product cycle, we
regained our product lead and eventually built a company that was worth $1.6
billion. Without the lead bullets, I suspect we would have ended at about onetenth that value.


There may be nothing scarier in business than facing an existential threat. So
scary that many in the organization will do anything to avoid facing it. They will
look for any alternative, any way out, any excuse not to live or die in a single
battle. I see this often in startup pitches. The conversations go something like
this:


Entrepreneur: “We have the best product in the market by far. All the
customers love it and prefer it to competitor X.”

Me: “Why does competitor X have five times your revenue?”
Entrepreneur: “We are using partners and OEMs, because we can’t build a
direct channel like competitor X.”

Me: “Why not? If you have the better product, why not knuckle up and go to
war?”


Entrepreneur: “Ummm.”
Me: “Stop looking for the silver bullet.”
There comes a time in every company’s life where it must fight for its life. If
you find yourself running when you should be fighting, you need to ask yourself,
“If our company isn’t good enough to win, then do we need to exist at all?”
