## **DEDICATION**

This is for Felicia, Sophia, Mariah, and the Boocher, _mi familia_, for putting

up with me when I was learning all of this.


One hundred percent of my portion of the proceeds of this book will go to

help women in developing countries gain basic civil rights via the

American Jewish World Service. They truly face the hard things.
