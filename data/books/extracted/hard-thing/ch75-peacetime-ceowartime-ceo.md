# **PEACETIME CEO/WARTIME CEO**

Bill Campbell always used to say to me, “Ben, you’re the best CEO that I work
with.” This always seemed crazy to me, because he was working with Steve
Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Eric Schmidt at the time while my company was going
straight into the wall. One day I called him on it and said, “Bill, why would you
say that? Do results not count?” He said, “There are lots of good peacetime
CEOs and lots of good wartime CEOs, but almost no CEOs that can function in
both peacetime and in wartime. You’re a peacetime/wartime CEO.”

By my calculation, I was a peacetime CEO for three days and wartime CEO
for eight years. I still have a hard time shaking the wartime flashbacks. I’m not
the only one who has experienced this. Dennis Crowley, the founder of
Foursquare, told me that he thinks about this tension—between wartime and
peacetime—every day. The same goes for a lot of tech companies.

For instance, when Eric Schmidt stepped down as CEO of Google and
founder Larry Page took over, much of the news coverage focused on Page’s
ability to be the “face of Google” since Page is far more shy and introverted than
the gregarious and articulate Schmidt. While an interesting issue, this analysis
misses the main point. Schmidt was much more than Google’s front man; as
Google’s _peacetime_ chief executive, he led the greatest technology business
expansion in the last ten years. Larry Page, in contrast, seems to have determined
that Google is moving into war and he clearly intends to be a _wartime_ CEO. This
has been a profound change for Google and the entire high-tech industry.


**DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES**


Peacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage
over the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of
peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the
company’s strengths.

In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a
threat can come from a wide range of sources, including competition, dramatic
macroeconomic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth. The


great wartime CEO Andy Grove marvelously describes the forces that can take a
company from peacetime to wartime in his book _Only the Paranoid Survive_ .

A classic peacetime mission is Google’s effort to make the Internet faster.
Google’s position in the search market is so dominant that they determined that
anything that makes the Internet faster accrues to their benefit since it enables
users to do more searches. As the clear market leader, they focus more on
expanding the market than dealing with their search competitors. In contrast, a
classic wartime mission was Andy Grove’s drive to get out of the memory
business in the mid-1980s due to an irrepressible threat from the Japanese
semiconductor companies. In this mission, the competitive threat—which could
have bankrupted the company—was so great that Intel had to exit its core
business, which employed 80 percent of its staff.

My greatest management discovery through the transition was that peacetime
and wartime require radically different management styles. Interestingly, most
management books describe peacetime CEO techniques and very few describe
wartime. For example, a basic principle in most management books is that you
should never embarrass an employee in a public setting. On the other hand, in a
room filled with people, Andy Grove once said to an employee who entered the
meeting late, “All I have in this world is time, and you are wasting my time.”
Why such different approaches to management?

In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As
a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based
creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In
wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber
and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company’s survival in wartime depends
upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission.

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the company was weeks away from
bankruptcy—a classic wartime scenario. He needed everyone to move with
precision and follow his exact plan; there was no room for individual creativity
outside the core mission. In stark contrast, as Google achieved dominance in the
search market, Google’s management fostered peacetime innovation by enabling
and even requiring every employee to spend 20 percent of their time on their
own new projects.

Peacetime and wartime management techniques can both be highly effective
when employed in the right situations, but they are very different. The peacetime
CEO does not resemble the wartime CEO.


**PEACETIME CEO/WARTIME CEO**


Peacetime CEO knows that proper protocol leads to winning. Wartime CEO
violates protocol in order to win.

Peacetime CEO focuses on the big picture and empowers her people to make
detailed decisions. Wartime CEO cares about a speck of dust on a gnat’s ass if it
interferes with the prime directive.

Peacetime CEO builds scalable, high-volume recruiting machines. Wartime
CEO does that, but also builds HR organizations that can execute layoffs.

Peacetime CEO spends time defining the culture. Wartime CEO lets the war
define the culture.


Peacetime CEO always has a contingency plan. Wartime CEO knows that
sometimes you gotta roll a hard six.

Peacetime CEO knows what to do with a big advantage. Wartime CEO is
paranoid.

Peacetime CEO strives not to use profanity. Wartime CEO sometimes uses
profanity purposefully.

Peacetime CEO thinks of the competition as other ships in a big ocean that
may never engage. Wartime CEO thinks the competition is sneaking into her
house and trying to kidnap her children.

Peacetime CEO aims to expand the market. Wartime CEO aims to win the
market.


Peacetime CEO strives to tolerate deviations from the plan when coupled with
effort and creativity. Wartime CEO is completely intolerant.

Peacetime CEO does not raise her voice. Wartime CEO rarely speaks in a
normal tone.


Peacetime CEO works to minimize conflict. Wartime CEO heightens the
contradictions.


Peacetime CEO strives for broad-based buy-in. Wartime CEO neither
indulges consensus building nor tolerates disagreements.

Peacetime CEO sets big, hairy, audacious goals. Wartime CEO is too busy
fighting the enemy to read management books written by consultants who have
never managed a fruit stand.

Peacetime CEO trains her employees to ensure satisfaction and career
development. Wartime CEO trains her employees so they don’t get their asses
shot off in the battle.


Peacetime CEO has rules like “We’re going to exit all businesses where we’re


not number one or two.” Wartime CEO often has no businesses that are number

one or two and therefore does not have the luxury of following that rule.


**CAN A CEO BE BOTH?**


Can a CEO build the skill sets to lead in both peacetime and wartime?

One could easily argue that I failed as a peacetime CEO but succeeded as a
wartime one. John Chambers had a great run as peacetime CEO of Cisco but has
struggled as Cisco has moved into war with Juniper, HP, and a range of new
competitors. Steve Jobs, who employed a classical wartime management style,
removed himself as CEO of Apple in the 1980s during their longest period of
peace before coming back to Apple for a spectacular run more than a decade
later, during their most intense war period.

I believe that the answer is yes, but it’s hard. Mastering both wartime and
peacetime skill sets means understanding the many rules of management and
knowing when to follow them and when to violate them.

Be aware that management books tend to be written by management
consultants who study successful companies during their times of peace. As a
result, the resulting books describe the methods of peacetime CEOs. In fact,
other than the books written by Andy Grove, I don’t know of any management
books that teach you how to manage in wartime like Steve Jobs or Andy Grove.


**BACK TO THE BEGINNING**


It turned out that a little wartime was just what the doctor ordered for Google.
Page’s precise and exacting leadership has led to brilliant execution in
integrating identity across Google’s broad product line, from the rise of Android
to brilliant new products like Google Glass. Sometimes you need to go to war.
