# **MANAGEMENT DEBT**

Thanks to Ward Cunningham, the computer programmer who designed the first
wiki, the metaphor “technical debt” is now a well-understood concept. While
you may be able to borrow time by writing quick and dirty code, you will
eventually have to pay it back—with interest. Often this trade-off makes sense,
but you will run into serious trouble if you fail to keep the trade-off in the front
of your mind. There also exists a less understood parallel concept, which I will
call _management debt_ .

Like technical debt, management debt is incurred when you make an
expedient, short-term management decision with an expensive, long-term
consequence. Like technical debt, the trade-off sometimes makes sense, but
often does not. More important, if you incur the management debt without
accounting for it, then you will eventually go management bankrupt.

Like technical debt, management debt comes in too many different forms to
elaborate entirely, but a few salient examples will help explain the concept. Here
are three of the more popular types among startups:


**1.** Putting two in the box


**2.** Overcompensating a key employee, because she gets another job offer


**3.** No performance management or employee feedback process


**PUTTING TWO IN THE BOX**


What do you do when you have two outstanding employees who logically both
fit in the same place on the organizational chart? Perhaps you have a world-class
architect who is running engineering, but she does not have the experience to
scale the organization to the next level. You also have an outstanding operational
person who is not great technically. You want to keep both in the company, but
you only have one position. So you get the bright idea to put “two in the box”
and take on a little management debt. The short-term benefits are clear: you keep
both employees, you don’t have to develop either because they will theoretically


help each other develop, and you instantly close the skill set gap. Unfortunately,
you will pay for those benefits with interest and at a very high rate.

For starters, by doing this you will make every engineer’s job more difficult.
If an engineer needs a decision made, which boss should she go to? If that boss
decides, will the other boss be able to override it? If it’s a complex decision that
requires a meeting, does she have to schedule both heads of engineering for the
meeting? Who sets the direction for the organization? Will the direction actually
get set if doing so requires a series of meetings?

In addition, you have removed all accountability. If schedules slip, who is
accountable? If engineering throughput becomes uncompetitive, who is
responsible? If the operational head is responsible for the schedule slip and the
technical head is responsible for throughput, what happens if the operational
head thrashes the engineers to make the schedule and kills throughput? How
would you know that she did that? The really expensive part about both of these
things is that they tend to get worse over time. In the very short term you might
mitigate their effects with extra meetings or by attempting to carve up the job in
a clear way. However, as things get busy, those once-clear lines will fade and the
organization will degenerate. Eventually, you’ll either make a lump-sum
payment by making the hard decision and putting one in the box or your
engineering organization will suck forever.


**OVERCOMPENSATING A KEY EMPLOYEE BECAUSE SHE**


**GETS ANOTHER JOB OFFER**


An excellent engineer decides to leave the company because she gets a better
offer. For various reasons, you were undercompensating her, but the offer from
the other company pays more than any engineer in your company and the
engineer in question is not your best engineer. Still, she is working on a critical
project and you cannot afford to lose her. So you match the offer. You save the
project, but you pile on the debt.

Here’s how the payment will come due. You probably think that your
counteroffer was confidential because you’d sworn her to secrecy. Let me
explain why it was not. She has friends in the company. When she got the offer
from the other company, she consulted with her friends. One of her best friends
advised her to take the offer. When she decided to stay, she had to explain to him
why she disregarded his advice or else lose personal credibility. So she told him
and swore him to secrecy. He agreed to honor the secret but was incensed that


she had to threaten to quit in order to get a proper raise. Furthermore, he was
furious that you overcompensated her. So he told the story to a few of his
friends, but kept her name confidential to preserve the secret. And now everyone
in engineering knows that the best way to get a raise is to generate an offer from
another company and then threaten to quit. It’s going to take a while to pay off
that debt.


**NO PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT OR EMPLOYEE**


**FEEDBACK PROCESS**


Your company now employs twenty-five people and you know that you should
formalize the performance management process, but you don’t want to pay the
price. You worry that doing so will make it feel like a “big company.”
Moreover, you do not want your employees to be offended by the feedback,
because you can’t afford to lose anyone right now. And people are happy, so
why rock the boat? Why not take on a little management debt?

The first noticeable payments will be due when somebody performs below
expectations:

CEO: “He was good when we hired him; what happened?”
Manager: “He’s not doing the things that we need him to do.”
CEO: “Did we clearly tell him that?”
Manager: “Maybe not clearly . . .”
However, the larger payment will be a silent tax. Companies execute well
when everybody is on the same page and everybody is constantly improving. In
a vacuum of feedback, there is almost no chance that your company will perform
optimally across either dimension. Directions with no corrections will seem
fuzzy and obtuse. People rarely improve weakness they are unaware of. The
ultimate price you will pay for not giving feedback: systematically crappy
company performance.


**IN THE END**


Every really good, really experienced CEO I know shares one important
characteristic: They tend to opt for the hard answer to organizational issues. If
faced with giving everyone the same bonus to make things easy or with sharply
rewarding performance and ruffling many feathers, they’ll ruffle the feathers. If
given the choice of cutting a popular project today, because it’s not in the longterm plans or you’re keeping it around for morale purposes and to appear


consistent, they’ll cut it today. Why? Because they’ve paid the price of
management debt, and they would rather not do that again.
