# **MAKING YOURSELF A CEO**

The other day, a friend of mine asked me whether CEOs were born or made. I
said, “That’s kind of like asking if Jolly Ranchers are grown or made. CEO is an
unnatural job.” The surprised look on his face made me realize that perhaps it
wasn’t as obvious as I’d originally thought.

Most people actually assume the opposite—CEOs are born, not made. I often
listen as other venture capitalists and board members rapidly evaluate a founder
and conclude that she’s not “CEO material.” I am not sure how they figure these
things out so fast. It generally takes years for a founder to develop the CEO skill
set and it is usually extremely difficult for me to tell whether she will make it.

In athletics, some things, like becoming a sprinter, can be learned relatively
quickly because they start with a natural motion and refine it. Others, like
boxing, take much longer to master because they require lots of unnatural
motions and lots of specific technique. For example, as I mentioned earlier,
when going backward in boxing it’s critically important to pick up your back
foot first, because if you get hit while walking backward the natural way—
picking up your front foot first—it often leads to getting knocked cold. Learning
to make this unnatural motion feel natural takes a great deal of practice. If you
do what feels most natural as a CEO, you may also get knocked cold.

Being CEO requires lots of unnatural motion. From an evolutionary
standpoint, it is natural to do things that make people like you. It enhances your
chances for survival. Yet to be a good CEO, in order to be liked in the long run,
you must do many things that will upset people in the short run. Unnatural
things.

Even the most basic CEO building blocks will feel unnatural at first. If your
buddy tells you a funny story, it would feel quite weird to evaluate her
performance. It would be totally unnatural to say, “Gee, I thought that story
really sucked. It had potential, but you were underwhelming on the buildup and
then you totally flubbed the punch line. I suggest that you go back, rework it,
and present it to me again tomorrow.”

Doing so would be quite bizarre, but evaluating people’s performances and
constantly giving feedback is precisely what a CEO must do. If she doesn’t, the


more complex motions such as writing reviews, taking away territory, handling
politics, setting compensation, and firing people will be either impossible or
handled rather poorly.

Giving feedback turns out to be the unnatural atomic building block atop
which the unnatural skill set of management gets built. But how does one master
the unnatural?


**THE SHIT SANDWICH**


A popular and sometimes effective technique for feedback beginners is
something that experienced managers call the _Shit Sandwich_ . The technique is
marvelously described in the classic management text _The One Minute Manager_ .
The basic idea is that people open up to feedback far more if you start by
complimenting them (slice of bread number one), then you give them the
difficult message (the shit), then wrap up by reminding them how much you
value their strengths (slice of bread number two). The shit sandwich also has the
positive side effect of focusing the feedback on the behavior rather than the
person, because you establish up front that you really value the person. This is a
key concept in giving feedback.

The shit sandwich can work well with junior employees but has the following
challenges:


It tends to be overly formal. Because you have to preplan and script the
sandwich to make it come out correctly, the process can feel formal and
judgmental to the employee.


After you do it a couple of times, it will lack authenticity. The employee
will think, “Oh boy, she’s complimenting me again. I know what’s coming
next, the shit.”


More senior executives will recognize the shit sandwich immediately and
it will have an instant negative effect.


Early in my career, I attempted to deliver a carefully crafted shit sandwich to a
senior employee and she looked at me like I was a little kid and said, “Spare me
the compliment, Ben, and just tell me what I did wrong.” At that point, I thought
that I was definitely not born to be a CEO.


**THE KEYS**


To become elite at giving feedback, you must elevate yourself beyond a basic
technique like the shit sandwich. You must develop a style that matches your
own personality and values. Here are the keys to being effective:


_Be authentic._ It’s extremely important that you believe in the feedback
that you give and not say anything to manipulate the recipient’s feelings.
You can’t fake the funk.


_Come from the right place._ It’s important that you give people feedback
because you want them to succeed and not because you want them to fail. If
you really want someone to succeed, then make her feel it. Make her feel
you. If she feels you and you are in her corner, then she will listen to you.


_Don’t get personal._ If you decide to fire somebody, fire her. Don’t
prepare her to get fired. Prepare her to succeed. If she doesn’t take the
feedback, that’s a different conversation.


_Don’t clown people in front of their peers._ While it’s okay to give certain
kinds of feedback in a group setting, you should strive never to embarrass
someone in front of their peers. If you do so, then your feedback will have
little impact other than to cause the employee to be horribly ashamed and to
hate your guts.


_Feedback is not one-size-fits-all._ Everybody is different. Some employees
are extremely sensitive to feedback while others have particularly thick skin
and often thick skulls. Stylistically, your tone should match the employee’s
personality, not your mood.


_Be direct, but not mean._ Don’t be obtuse. If you think somebody’s
presentation sucks, don’t say, “It’s really good, but could use one more pass
to tighten up the conclusion.” While it may seem harsh, it’s much better to
say, “I couldn’t follow it and I didn’t understand your point and here are the
reasons why.” Watered-down feedback can be worse than no feedback at all
because it’s deceptive and confusing to the recipient. But don’t beat them
up or attempt to show your superiority. Doing so will defeat your purpose
because when done properly, feedback is a dialogue, not a monologue.


**FEEDBACK IS A DIALOGUE, NOT A MONOLOGUE**


You may be the CEO and you may be telling somebody about something that
you don’t like or disagree with, but that doesn’t mean you’re right. Your


employee should know more about her function than you. She should have more
data than you. You may be wrong.

As a result, your goal should be for your feedback to open up rather than close
down discussion. Encourage people to challenge your judgment and argue the
point to conclusion. Culturally, you want high standards thoroughly discussed.
You want to apply tremendous pressure to get the highest-quality thinking yet be
open enough to find out when you are wrong.


**HIGH-FREQUENCY FEEDBACK**


Once you’ve mastered the keys, you should practice what you’ve mastered all
the time. As CEO, you should have an opinion on absolutely everything. You
should have an opinion on every forecast, every product plan, every
presentation, and even every comment. Let people know what you think. If you
like someone’s comment, give her the feedback. If you disagree, give her the
feedback. Say what you think. Express yourself.

This will have two critically important positive effects:


_Feedback won’t be personal in your company._ If the CEO constantly
gives feedback, then everyone she interacts with will just get used to it.
Nobody will think, “Gee, what did she really mean by that comment? Does
she not like me?” Everybody will naturally focus on the issues, not an
implicit random performance evaluation.


_People will become comfortable discussing bad news._ If people get
comfortable talking about what _each other_ are doing wrong, then it will be
very easy to talk about what _the company_ is doing wrong. High-quality
company cultures get their cue from data networking routing protocols: Bad
news travels fast and good news travels slowly. Low-quality company
cultures take on the personality of the Wicked Witch of the West in _The_
_Wiz_ : “Don’t nobody bring me no bad news.”


**MAKING THE CEO**


Being CEO also requires a broad set of more advanced skills, but the key to
reaching the advanced level and feeling like you were born to be CEO is
mastering the unnatural.

If you are a founder CEO and you feel awkward or incompetent when doing
some of these things and believe there is no way that you’ll be able to do it when


your company is one hundred or one thousand people, welcome to the club.
That’s exactly how I felt. So did every CEO I’ve ever met. This is the process.
This is how you get made.
