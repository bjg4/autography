# **THE MOST DIFFICULT CEO SKILL**

By far the most difficult skill I learned as CEO was the ability to manage my
own psychology. Organizational design, process design, metrics, hiring, and
firing were all relatively straightforward skills to master compared with keeping
my mind in check. I thought I was tough going into it, but I wasn’t tough. I was
soft.


Over the years, I’ve spoken to hundreds of CEOs, all with the same
experience. Nonetheless, very few people talk about it and I have never read
anything on the topic. It’s like the fight club of management: The first rule of the
CEO psychological meltdown is don’t talk about the psychological meltdown.

At the risk of violating the sacred rule, I will attempt to describe the condition
and prescribe some techniques that helped me. In the end, this is the most
personal and important battle that any CEO will face.


**IF I’M DOING A GOOD JOB, WHY DO I FEEL SO BAD?**


Generally, someone doesn’t become a CEO unless she has a high sense of
purpose and cares deeply about the work she does. In addition, a CEO must be
accomplished enough or smart enough that people will want to work for her.
Nobody sets out to be a bad CEO, run a dysfunctional organization, or create a
massive bureaucracy that grinds her company to a screeching halt. Yet no CEO
ever has a smooth path to a great company. Along the way, many things go
wrong and all of them could have and should have been avoided.

The first problem is that everybody learns to be a CEO by being a CEO. No
training as a manager, general manager, or in any other job actually prepares you
to run a company. The only thing that prepares you to run a company is running
a company. This means that you will face a broad set of things that you don’t
know how to do that require skills you don’t have. Nevertheless, everybody will
expect you to know how to do them, because, well, you are the CEO. I
remember when I first became CEO, an investor asked me to send him the “cap
table.” I had a vague idea of what he meant, but I didn’t actually know what the
format was supposed to look like or what should be included or excluded. It was


a silly little thing and I had much bigger things to worry about, but everything is
hard when you don’t actually know what you are doing. I wasted quite a bit of
time sweating over that stupid spreadsheet.

Even if you know what you are doing, things go wrong. Things go wrong
because building a multifaceted human organization to compete and win in a
dynamic, highly competitive market turns out to be really hard. If CEOs were
graded on a curve, the mean on the test would be 22 out of 100. This kind of
mean can be psychologically challenging for a straight-A student. It is
particularly challenging because nobody tells you that the mean is 22.

If you manage a team of ten people, it’s quite possible to do so with very few
mistakes or bad behaviors. If you manage an organization of one thousand
people, it is quite impossible. At a certain size, your company will do things that
are so bad that you never imagined that you’d be associated with that kind of
incompetence. Seeing people fritter away money, waste each other’s time, and
do sloppy work can make you feel bad. If you are the CEO, it may well make
you sick.

And to rub salt into the wound and make matters worse, it’s your fault.


**NOBODY TO BLAME**


“You can’t blame Jazz musicians

or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues.”


**—NAS, “HIP HOP IS DEAD”**


When people in my company would complain about one thing or another being
broken, such as the expense reporting process, I would joke that it was all my
fault. The joke was funny, because it wasn’t really a joke. Every problem in the
company was indeed my fault. As the founding CEO, every hire and every
decision that the company ever made happened under my direction. Unlike a
hired gun who comes in and blames all of the problems on the prior regime,
there was literally nobody for me to blame.

If someone was promoted for all the wrong reasons, that was my fault. If we
missed the quarterly earnings target, that was my fault. If a great engineer quit,
that was my fault. If the sales team made unreasonable demands on the product
organization, that was my fault. If the product had too many bugs, that was my
fault. It kind of sucked to be me.


Being responsible for everything and getting a 22 on the test starts to weigh on


your consciousness.


**TOO MUCH BROKEN STUFF**


Given this stress, CEOs often make one of the following two mistakes:


**1.** They take things too personally.


**2.** They do not take things personally enough.


In the first scenario, the CEO takes every issue incredibly seriously and
personally and urgently moves to fix it. Given the volume of the issues, this
motion usually results in one of two scenarios. If the CEO is outwardly focused,
she ends up terrorizing the team to the point where nobody wants to work at the
company anymore. If the CEO is inwardly focused, she ends up feeling so sick
from all the problems that she can barely make it to work in the morning.

In the second scenario, in order to dampen the pain of the rolling disaster that
is the company, the CEO takes a Pollyannaish attitude: It’s not so bad. In this
view, none of the problems is actually that bad and they needn’t be dealt with
urgently. By rationalizing away the issues, the CEO feels better about herself.
The problem is that she doesn’t actually fix any of the problems and the
employees eventually become quite frustrated that the chief executive keeps
ignoring the most basic problems and conflicts. Ultimately, the company turns to

crap.

Ideally, the CEO will be urgent yet not insane. She will move aggressively
and decisively without feeling emotionally culpable. If she can separate the
importance of the issues from how she feels about them, she will avoid
demonizing her employees or herself.


**IT’S A LONELY JOB**


In your darkest moments as CEO, discussing fundamental questions about the
viability of your company with your employees can have obvious negative
consequences. On the other hand, talking to your board and outside advisers can
be fruitless. The knowledge gap between you and them is so vast that you cannot
actually bring them fully up to speed in a manner that’s useful in making the
decision. You are all alone.


At Loudcloud, when the dot-com bubble burst and subsequently sent most of
our customers into bankruptcy, it crippled our business and devastated our


balance sheet. Or rather, that was one interpretation. Another interpretation, and
necessarily the official story for the company, was that we still had plenty of
money in the bank and were signing up traditional enterprise customers at an
impressive rate. Which interpretation was closer to the truth? In the absence of
someone to talk to, that’s a question that I asked myself about three thousand
times. (As an aside, asking oneself anything three thousand times turns out to be
a bad idea.) In this case, I had two specific difficult questions:


**1.** What if the official interpretation was wrong? What if I was misleading
everyone from investors to employees? In that case, I should be removed
from my position immediately.


**2.** What if the official interpretation was right? What if I was grinding my
brain into sawdust for no reason at all? What if I was taking the company
off track by questioning my own direction? In that case, I should be
removed from my position immediately.


As is usually the case, there was no way to know which interpretation was
right until much later. It turned out that neither was actually right. The new
customers didn’t save us, but we figured out another way to survive and
ultimately succeed. The key to getting to the right outcome was to keep from
getting married to either the positive or the dark narrative.

My friend Jason Rosenthal took over as CEO of Ning in 2010. As soon as he
became CEO, he faced a cash crisis and had to choose among three difficult
choices: (1) radically reduce the size of the company, (2) sell the company, or
(3) raise money in a highly dilutive way.

Think about those choices:


**1.** Lay off a large set of talented employees whom he worked very hard to
recruit and, as a result, likely severely damage the morale of the remaining
people.


**2.** Sell out all of the employees whom he had been working side by side
with for the past several years (Jason was promoted into the position) by
selling the company without giving them a chance to perform or fulfill their
mission.


**3.** Drastically reduce the ownership position of the employees and make
their hard work economically meaningless.


Choices like these cause migraine headaches. Tip to aspiring entrepreneurs: If
you don’t like choosing between horrible and cataclysmic, don’t become CEO.

Jason sought advice from some of the best minds in the industry, but
ultimately he was completely alone in the final decision. Nobody had the answer
and whatever the answer, Jason was the one who had to live with the
consequences. So far his decision to reduce staff by letting go of primarily the
most recent hires has paid off. Revenue at Ning is soaring and team morale is
high. If it had gone worse (or ultimately goes bad), it would be all Jason’s fault
and it would be up to Jason to find a new answer. Whenever I see Jason, I like to
say, “Welcome to the show.” Jason eventually sold Ning to Glam and went on to
become CEO of Lytro.

At times like this, it’s important to understand that nearly every company goes
through life-threatening moments. My partner at Andreessen Horowitz, Scott
Weiss, relayed that it’s so common that there is an acronym for it, WFIO, which
stands for “We’re Fucked, It’s Over” (it’s pronounced “whiff-ee-yo”). As he
describes it, every company goes through at least two and up to five of these
episodes (although I’m pretty sure that I went through at least a dozen at
Opsware). In all cases, WFIOs feel much worse than they are—especially for the
CEO.


**TECHNIQUES TO CALM YOUR NERVES**


The problem with psychology is that everybody’s is different. With that as a
caveat, over the years I developed a few techniques for dealing with myself. I
hope you find them useful, too.

_Make some friends._ Although it’s nearly impossible to get high-quality advice
on the tough decisions that you make, it is extremely useful from a psychological
perspective to talk to people who have been through similarly challenging
decisions.


_Get it out of your head and onto paper._ When I had to explain to my board
that, since we were a public company, I thought that it would be best if we sold
all of our customers and all of our revenue and changed business, it was messing
with my mind. In order to finalize that decision, I wrote down a detailed
explanation of my logic. The process of writing that document separated me
from my own psychology and enabled me to make the decision swiftly.

_Focus on the road, not the wall._ When someone learns to drive a race car, one
of the first lessons taught is that when you are going around a curve at 200 mph,


do not focus on the wall; focus on the road. If you focus on the wall, you will
drive right into it. If you focus on the road, you will follow the road. Running a
company is like that. There are always a thousand things that can go wrong and
sink the ship. If you focus too much on them, you will drive yourself nuts and
likely crash your company. Focus on where you are going rather than on what
you hope to avoid.


**DON’T PUNK OUT AND DON’T QUIT**


As CEO, there will be many times when you feel like quitting. I have seen CEOs
try to cope with the stress by drinking heavily, checking out, and even quitting.
In each case, the CEO has a marvelous rationalization about why it was okay for
him to punk out or quit, but none of them will ever be great CEOs.

Great CEOs face the pain. They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold
sweats, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary cofounder and
CEO of BEA Systems) calls “the torture.” Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I
ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves
or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory
explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers.
They all say, “I didn’t quit.”


# **THE FINE LINE BETWEEN FEAR AND** **COURAGE**

“I tell my kids, what is the difference between a hero and a coward? What
is the difference between being yellow and being brave? No difference.
Only what you do. They both feel the same. They both fear dying and
getting hurt. The man who is yellow refuses to face up to what he’s got to
face. The hero is more disciplined and he fights those feelings off and he
does what he has to do. But they both feel the same, the hero and the
coward. People who watch you judge you on what you do, not how you
feel.”


**—CUS D’AMATO, LEGENDARY BOXING TRAINER**


When my partners and I meet with entrepreneurs, the two key characteristics that
we look for are brilliance and courage. In my experience as CEO, I found that
the most important decisions tested my courage far more than my intelligence.

The right decision is often obvious, but the pressure to make the wrong
decision can be overwhelming. It starts with small things.

When founders come in to pitch our firm—one as the CEO and the other as
president—the conversation often goes like this: “Who is running the
company?”

“We are,” they both say.
“Who makes the final decision?”

“We do.”

“How long do you expect to run that way?”
“Forever.”

“So you’ve decided to make it more difficult for every employee to get work
done so that you don’t have to decide who is in charge, is that right?”

That usually results in silence.
Intellectually, it should be clear that it is easier for employees to go to one
decision maker than two. It’s not really very complicated at all. Unfortunately,
the clear and present social pressure often overwhelms the long-term benefits of


organizing the company properly. Because the founders do not have the courage
to decide who is in charge, every employee suffers the inconvenience of double
approval.

More important, decisions only get scarier as a company grows. When we
decided to take Loudcloud public with only $2 million in revenue, it was not a
hard choice intellectually—the alternative was to go bankrupt. It was
nonetheless terrifying to do something that most employees, everyone in the
press, and many investors thought was nuts.


**WHEN MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE REQUIRES**


**INTELLIGENCE AND COURAGE**


Sometimes the decision itself is rather complicated, which makes the courage
challenge even more difficult. CEOs possess a different set of data, knowledge,
and perspective than anybody else in the company. Frequently, some of the
employees and board members are more experienced and more intelligent than
the CEO. The only reason the CEO can make a better decision is her superior
knowledge.

To make matters worse, when a CEO faces a particularly difficult decision,
she may have only a slight preference for one choice over another—say 54
percent kill a product line, 46 percent keep it. If the really smart people on the
board and on her staff take the other side, her courage will be severely tested.
How can she kill the product when she is not even sure if she is making the right
decision and everyone is against her? If she’s wrong, she will have been wrong
in the face of advice from her top advisers. If she is right, will anybody even
know?


Recently, a large company offered to buy one of our portfolio companies. The
deal was lucrative and compelling given the portfolio company’s progress to
date and revenue level. The founder/CEO (I’ll call him Hamlet—not his real
name) thought that selling did not make sense due to the giant market
opportunity that he was pursuing, but he still wanted to make sure that he made
the best possible choice for investors and employees. Hamlet wanted to reject
the offer, but only marginally. To complicate matters, most of the management
team and the board thought the opposite. It did not help that the board and the
management team were far more experienced than Hamlet. As a result, Hamlet
spent many sleepless nights worrying about whether he was right. He realized
that it was impossible to know. This did not help him sleep. In the end, Hamlet


made the best and most courageous decision he could and did not sell the
company. I believe that will prove to be the defining moment of his career.

Interestingly, as soon as Hamlet made the decision, the entire board and
executive team immediately embraced the choice. Why? If they wanted to sell
the company enough to advise the CEO to give up his dream, how could they
reverse themselves so quickly? It turns out that the most important data point
driving their earlier preference for selling the company was Hamlet’s initial
ambivalence—the team supported the decision they _thought_ the CEO wanted.
Hamlet did not realize this and interpreted their desire to sell to be the result of a
thorough analysis. Luckily for everybody involved, he had the courage to make
the right decision.

The general problem can be seen in the social credit matrix below. The
expected social rewards for making the crowd-influenced decision appear better
than those for making the decision you think is right:












|Col1|You are right|You are wrong|
|---|---|---|
|**You decide**<br>**against the**<br>**crowd.**|Few remember that you made<br>the decision, but the company<br>succeeds.|Everybody remembers the<br>decision and you are downgraded,<br>ostracized, or fired.|
|**You**<br>**decide**<br>**with the**<br>**crowd.**<br>|Everyone who advised you<br>remembers the decision and the<br>company succeeds.|You receive the minimum blame<br>possible for getting it wrong, but<br>the company suffers.|



On the surface, it appears that if the decision is a close call, it’s much safer to
go with the crowd. In reality, if you fall into this trap, the crowd will influence
your thinking and make a 70-30 decision seem like a 51-49 decision. This is why
courage is critical.


**COURAGE, LIKE CHARACTER, CAN BE DEVELOPED**


In all the difficult decisions that I made through the course of running Loudcloud
and Opsware, I never once felt brave. In fact, I often felt scared to death. I never
lost those feelings, but after much practice I learned to ignore them. That
learning process might also be called the _courage development process_ .

In life, everybody faces choices between doing what’s popular, easy, and
wrong versus doing what’s lonely, difficult, and right. These decisions intensify


when you run a company, because the consequences get magnified a
thousandfold. As in life, the excuses for CEOs making the wrong choice are
always plentiful.










|Life Excuse|CEO Excuse|
|---|---|
|Other smart people made<br>the same mistake.|It was a close call.|
|All my friends wanted to do<br>it.|The team was against me and I couldn’t go<br>against the team.|
|All the cool kids are doing<br>it.|It was industry best practice; I didn’t realize it was<br>illegal.|
|It wasn’t perfect, so I<br>decided not to compete.|We never achieved total product-market fit, so we<br>never tried to sell our product.|



Every time you make the hard, correct decision you become a bit more
courageous and every time you make the easy, wrong decision you become a bit
more cowardly. If you are CEO, these choices will lead to a courageous or
cowardly company.


**LAST THOUGHT**


Over the past ten years, technological advances have dramatically lowered the
financial bar for starting a new company, but the courage bar for building a great
company remains as high as it has ever been.
