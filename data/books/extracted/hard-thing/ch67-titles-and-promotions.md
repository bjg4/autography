# **TITLES AND PROMOTIONS**

Often when I meet with startups, the employees have no job titles. This makes
sense, because everybody is just working to build the company. Roles needn’t be
clearly defined and, in fact, can’t be, because everyone does a little bit of
everything. In an environment like this there are no politics and nobody is
jockeying for position or authority. It’s rather nice. So why do all organizations
eventually create job titles and what is the proper way to manage them? (Thanks
to Mark Zuckerberg for contributing to my thinking on this subject.)


**WHY DO TITLES MATTER?**


Two important factors drive all companies to eventually create job titles:


**1.** _Employees want them._ While you may plan to work at your company
forever, at least some of your employees need to plan for life after your
company. When your head of sales interviews for her next job, she won’t
want to say that despite the fact that she ran a global sales force with
hundreds of employees, her title was “Dude.”


**2.** _Eventually, people need to know who is who._ As companies grow,
everybody won’t know everybody else. Importantly, employees won’t
know what each person does and whom they should work with to get their
jobs done. Job titles provide an excellent shorthand for describing roles in
the company. In addition, customers and business partners can also make
use of this shorthand to figure out how to best work with your company.


Beyond these core reasons, employees will use titles to calibrate their value
and compensation against their colleagues. If an employee with a title of Junior
Engineer believes that she is a far better programmer than her counterpart with
the title Senior Architect, this will indicate to her that she may be underpaid and
undervalued. Because titles will be used to calculate relative value, they must be
managed carefully.


**THE DANGERS: THE PETER PRINCIPLE AND THE LAW OF**


**CRAPPY PEOPLE**


The basics seem obvious, so why does almost every company eventually make
serious mistakes regarding titles? If you have ever worked in a company, you
have probably thought to yourself about some overly promoted executive: “How
did he get to be a vice president? I wouldn’t let him manage a lemonade stand.”

One challenge is the Peter Principle. Coined by Dr. Laurence J. Peter and
Raymond Hull in their 1969 book of that name, the Peter Principle holds that in
a hierarchy, members are promoted so long as they work competently. Sooner or
later they are promoted to a position at which they are no longer competent (their
“level of incompetence”), and there they remain being unable to earn further
promotions. As Andy Grove points out in his management classic _High Output_
_Management_, the Peter Principle is unavoidable, because there is no way to
know a priori at what level in the hierarchy a manager will be incompetent.

Another challenge is a phenomenon that I call the _Law of Crappy People_ . The
Law of Crappy People states: _For any title level in a large organization, the_
_talent on that level will eventually converge to the crappiest person with the title._

The rationale behind the law is that the other employees in the company with
lower titles will naturally benchmark themselves against the crappiest person at
the next level. For example, if Jasper is the worst vice president in the company,
then all of the directors will benchmark themselves against Jasper and demand
promotions as soon as they reach his low level of competency.

As with the Peter Principle, the best that you can do is to mitigate the Law of
Crappy People and that mitigation will be critically important to the quality of

your company.


**PROMOTION PROCESS**


The best way to mitigate both the Peter Principle and the Law of Crappy People
is with a properly constructed and highly disciplined promotion process. Ideally,
the promotion process should yield a result similar to the very best karate dojos.
In top dojos, in order to achieve the next level (for example, being promoted
from a brown belt to a black belt), you must defeat an opponent in combat at that
level. This guarantees that a new black belt is never a worse fighter than the
worst current black belt.


Frustratingly, there is no exact analogue to a fistfight in business, so how can
we preserve quality without actual combat?


To begin, start with an extremely crisp definition not only of the
responsibilities at each level but also of the skill required to perform the duties.
When describing the skills, avoid the generic characterizations such as “must be
competent at managing a P&L” or “must have excellent management skills.” In
fact, the best leveling tools get extremely specific and even name names:
“should be a superstar recruiter—as good as Jenny Rogers.”

Next, define a formal process for all promotions. One key requirement of the
process should be that promotions will be leveled across groups. If you let a
manager or a single chain of command determine promotions unilaterally, then
it’s possible that, for example, HR will have five vice presidents and
Engineering only one. One way to level across groups is to hold a regular
promotions council that reviews every significant promotion in the company.
When a manager wishes to promote an employee, she will submit that employee
for review with an explanation of why she believes her employee satisfies the
skill criteria required for the level. The committee should then compare the
employee with both the level’s skill description and the skills of the other
employees at that level to determine whether to approve the promotion. In
addition to ensuring fairness and level quality, this process will serve to educate
your entire management team on the skills and accomplishments of the
employees being submitted for promotion.


**ANDREESSEN VS. ZUCKERBERG: HOW BIG SHOULD THE**


**TITLES BE?**


Should your company make Vice President the top title or should you have
Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, Chief People Officers, and
Chief Snack Officers? There are two schools of thought regarding this, one
represented by Marc Andreessen and the other by Mark Zuckerberg.

Andreessen argues that people ask for many things from a company: salary,
bonus, stock options, span of control, and titles. Of those, title is by far the
cheapest, so it makes sense to give the highest titles possible. The hierarchy
should have Presidents, Chiefs, and Senior Executive Vice Presidents. If it
makes people feel better, let them feel better. Titles cost nothing. Better yet,
when competing for new employees with other companies, using Andreessen’s
method you can always outbid the competition in at least one dimension.

At Facebook, by contrast, Mark Zuckerberg purposely deploys titles that are
significantly lower than the industry standard. Senior Vice Presidents at other


companies must take title haircuts down to Directors or Managers at Facebook.
Why does he do this? First, he guarantees that every new employee gets
releveled as they enter his company. In this way, he avoids accidentally giving
new employees higher titles and positions than better-performing existing
employees. This boosts morale and increases fairness. Second, it forces all the
managers of Facebook to understand and internalize Facebook’s leveling system,
which serves the company extremely well in their own promotion and
compensation processes.

He also wants titles to be meaningful and reflect who has influence in the
organization. As a company grows quickly, it’s important to provide
organizational clarity wherever possible and that gets more difficult if there are
fifty VPs and ten Chiefs.

Next, he finds that businesspeople often carry inflated titles versus their
engineering counterparts. While he recognizes that big titles help them out
externally with getting meetings, he still wants to have an organization where the
product people and engineers form the cultural core, so he strives to keep this in
check as well.


Does Facebook ever miss out on a new hire due to its low titles? Yes,
definitely. But one might argue that they miss out on precisely the employees
they don’t want. In fact, both the hiring and onboarding processes at Facebook
have been carefully designed to encourage the right kind of employees to select
themselves in and the wrong ones to select themselves out.

So which method is better, Andreessen’s or Zuckerberg’s? The answer is that
it depends. Facebook has so many advantages in recruiting employees that being
disciplined about absolute title levels does not significantly impair its ability to
attract the very best talent. Your company might not have these advantages, so
lofty titles may be a good tactic. In either scenario, you should still run a highly
disciplined internal leveling and promotion process.


**FINAL THOUGHT**


You might think that so much time spent on promotions and titles places too
much importance and focus on silly formalisms. The opposite is true. Without a
well thought out, disciplined process for titles and promotions, your employees
will become obsessed with the resulting inequities. If you structure things
properly, nobody other than you will spend much time thinking about titles other
than Employee of the Month.


# **WHEN SMART PEOPLE ARE BAD** **EMPLOYEES**

In business, intelligence is always a critical element in any employee, because
what we do is difficult and complex and the competitors are filled with
extremely smart people. However, intelligence is not the only important quality.
Being effective in a company also means working hard, being reliable, and being
an excellent member of the team.


When I was a CEO, this was one of the most difficult lessons for me to learn.
I felt that it was my job to create an environment where brilliant people of all
backgrounds, personality types, and work styles would thrive. And I was right.
That was my job. Companies where people with diverse backgrounds and work
styles can succeed have significant advantages in recruiting and retaining top
talent over those that don’t. Still, you can take it too far. And I did.

Here are three examples of the smartest people in the company being the
worst employees.


**EXAMPLE 1: THE HERETIC**


Any sizable company produces some number of strategies, projects, processes,
promotions, and other activities that don’t make sense. No large organization
achieves perfection. As a result, a company needs lots of smart, super-engaged
employees who can identify its particular weaknesses and help it improve them.

However, sometimes a really smart employee develops an agenda other than
improving the company. Rather than identifying weaknesses so that he can fix
them, he looks for faults to build his case. Specifically, he builds his case that the
company is hopeless and run by a bunch of morons. The smarter the employee,
the more destructive this type of behavior can be. Simply put, it takes a really
smart person to be maximally destructive, because otherwise nobody else will
listen to him.


Why would a smart person try to destroy the company that he works for?
There are actually many reasons. Here are a few:


**1.** _She is disempowered._ She feels that she cannot access the people in
charge and, as a result, complaining is her only vehicle to get the truth out.


**2.** _She is fundamentally a rebel._ She will not be happy unless she is
rebelling; this can be a deep personality trait. Sometimes these people
actually make better CEOs than employees.


**3.** _She is immature and naive._ She cannot comprehend that the people
running the company do not know every minute detail of the operation and
therefore they are complicit in everything that’s broken.


Often, it’s very difficult to turn these kinds of cases around. Once an
employee takes a public stance, the social pressure for him to be consistent is
enormous. If he tells fifty of his closest friends that the CEO is the stupidest
person on the planet, then reversing that position will cost him a great amount of
credibility the next time he complains. Most people are not willing to take the hit
to their credibility.


**EXAMPLE 2: THE FLAKE**


Some brilliant people can be totally unreliable. At Opsware, we once hired an
unequivocal genius—Arthur (not his real name) was an engineer in an area of
the product where a typical new hire would take three months to become fully
productive. Arthur got fully up to speed in two days. On his third day, we gave
him a project that was scheduled to take one month. Arthur completed the
project in three days with nearly flawless quality. More specifically, he
completed the project in seventy-two hours. Seventy-two nonstop hours: No
stops, no sleep, no nothing but coding. In his first quarter on the job, he was the
best employee that we had and we immediately promoted him.

Then Arthur changed. He would miss days of work without calling in. Then
he would miss weeks of work. When he finally showed up, he apologized
profusely, but the behavior didn’t stop. His work product also degraded. He
became sloppy and unfocused. I could not understand how such a stellar
employee could go so haywire. His manager wanted to fire him, because the
team could no longer count on Arthur for anything. I resisted. I knew that the
genius was still in him and I wanted us to find it. We never did. It turned out that
Arthur was bipolar and had two significant drug problems: (1) He did not like
taking his bipolar medication and (2) he was addicted to cocaine. Ultimately, we
had to fire Arthur, but even now, it pains me to think about what might have


been.


One need not be bipolar to be a flake, but flaky behavior often has a seriously
problematic root cause. Causes range from self-destructive streaks to drug habits
to moonlighting for other employers. A company is a team effort and, no matter
how high an employee’s potential, you cannot get value from him unless he does
his work in a manner in which he can be relied upon.


**EXAMPLE 3: THE JERK**


This particular smart-bad-employee type can occur anywhere in the organization
but is most destructive at the executive level. Most executives can be pricks,
dicks, a-holes, or a variety of other profane nouns at times. Being dramatically
impolite can be used to improve clarity or emphasize an important lesson. That’s
not the behavior that I am talking about.

When used consistently, asinine behavior can be crippling. As a company
grows, its biggest challenge always becomes communication. Keeping a huge
number of people on the same page executing the same goals is never easy. If a
member of your staff is a raging jerk, it may be impossible. Some people are so
belligerent in their communication style that people just stop talking when they
are in the room. If every time anyone brings up an issue with the marketing
organization, the VP of marketing jumps down their throats, then guess what
topic will never come up? This behavior can become so bad that nobody brings
up any topic when the jerk is in the room. As a result, communication across the
executive staff breaks down and the entire company slowly degenerates. Note
that this only happens if the jerk in question is unquestionably brilliant.
Otherwise, nobody will care when she attacks them. The bite only has impact if
it comes from a big dog. If one of your big dogs destroys communication on
your staff, you need to send her to the pound.


**WHEN DO YOU HOLD THE BUS?**


The great football coach John Madden was once asked whether he would
tolerate a player like Terrell Owens on his team. Owens was both one of the
most talented players in the game and one of the biggest jerks. Madden
answered, “If you hold the bus for everyone on the team, then you’ll be so late
you’ll miss the game, so you can’t do that. The bus must leave on time.
However, sometimes you’ll have a player that’s so good that you hold the bus
for him, but only him.”


Phil Jackson, the coach who has won the most NBA championships, was once
asked about his famously flaky superstar Dennis Rodman, “Since Dennis
Rodman is allowed to miss practice, does this mean other star players like
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen can miss practice, too?” Jackson replied, “Of
course not. There is only room for one Dennis Rodman on this team. In fact, you
really can only have a very few Dennis Rodmans in society as a whole;
otherwise, we would degenerate into anarchy.”

You may find yourself with an employee who fits one of the above
descriptions but nonetheless makes a massive positive contribution to the
company. You may decide that you will personally mitigate the employee’s
negative attributes and keep her from polluting the overall company culture.
That’s fine, but remember: You can only hold the bus for her.
