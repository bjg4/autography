# **THE RIGHT WAY TO LAY PEOPLE OFF**

Shortly after we sold Opsware to Hewlett-Packard, I had a conversation with the
legendary venture capitalist Doug Leone of Sequoia Capital. He wanted me to
recount the story of how we went from doomed in the eyes of the world to a $1.6
billion outcome with no recapitalization.

After I took him through the details—including several near bankruptcies, a
stock price of $0.35 per share, unlimited bad press, and three separate layoffs
where we lost a total of four hundred employees—he was most amazed by the
layoffs. During more than twenty years in the venture capital business, he’d
never seen a company recover from consecutive layoffs and achieve a billiondollar-plus outcome. He confessed that he’d bet against that every time. Since
my only experience was the great exception, I needed more information. I asked
him why all the other startups failed. He replied that the layoffs inevitably broke
the company’s culture. After seeing their friends laid off, employees were no
longer willing to make the requisite sacrifices needed to build a company. He
said that although it was possible to survive an isolated layoff, it was hugely
unlikely that a company would experience great success. Building a highly
valuable business, he added, after three consecutive giant layoffs accompanied
by horrible prominent press coverage (we got taken apart with cover stories in
both the _Wall Street Journal_ and _BusinessWeek_ ), was a complete violation of the
laws of venture capital physics. He wanted to know how we did it. After
thinking about this question, here’s my answer.

In retrospect, we were able to keep cultural continuity and retain our best
employees despite multiple massive layoffs because we laid people off the right
way. This may sound nutty—how can you do something that’s fundamentally
wrong in “the right way”? Here’s how.


**STEP 1: GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT**


When a company fails to hit its financial plan so severely that it must fire the
employees it went to great time and expense to hire, it weighs heavily on the
chief executive. During the first layoff at our company, I remember being


forwarded an email exchange among a group of employees. In the exchange, one
of our smarter employees wrote, “Ben is either lying or stupid or both.” I
remember reading that and thinking, “definitely stupid.” During a time like this,
it is difficult to focus on the future, because the past overwhelms you—but that’s
exactly what you must do.


**STEP 2: DON’T DELAY**


Once you decide that you will have to lay people off, the time elapsed between
making that decision and executing that decision should be as short as possible.
If word leaks (which it will inevitably if you delay), then you will be faced with
an additional set of issues. Employees will question managers and ask whether a
layoff is coming. If the managers don’t know, they will look stupid. If the
managers do know, they will either have to lie to their employees, contribute to
the leak, or remain silent, which will create additional agitation. At
Loudcloud/Opsware, we badly mismanaged this dynamic with our first round of
layoffs, but sharply corrected things on the next two.


**STEP 3: BE CLEAR IN YOUR OWN MIND ABOUT WHY YOU**


**ARE LAYING PEOPLE OFF**


Going into a layoff, board members will sometimes try to make you feel better
by putting a positive spin on things. They might say, “This gives us a great
opportunity to deal with some performance issues and simplify the business.”
That may be true, but do not let that cloud your thinking or your message to the
company. You are laying people off because the company failed to hit its plan. If
individual performance were the only issue, then you’d be taking a different
measure. _Company_ performance failed. This distinction is critical, because the
message to the company and the laid-off individuals should not be “This is great,
we are cleaning up performance.” The message must be “The company failed
and in order to move forward, we will have to lose some excellent people.”
Admitting to the failure may not seem like a big deal, but trust me, it is. “Trust
me.” That’s what a CEO says every day to her employees. Trust me: This will be
a good company. Trust me: This will be good for your career. Trust me: This
will be good for your life. A layoff breaks that trust. In order to rebuild trust, you
have to come clean.


**STEP 4: TRAIN YOUR MANAGERS**


The most important step in the whole exercise is training the management team.
If you send managers into this super-uncomfortable situation with no training,
most of them will fail.


Training starts with a golden rule: _Managers must lay off their own people_ .
They cannot pass the task to HR or to a more sadistic peer. You cannot hire an
outsourcing firm like the one in the movie _Up in the Air_ . Every manager must
lay off his own people.

Why so strict? Why can’t the more confrontational managers just handle this
task for everyone? Because people won’t remember every day they worked for
your company, but they will surely remember the day you laid them off. They
will remember every last detail about that day and the details will matter greatly.
The reputations of your company and your managers depend on you standing
tall, facing the employees who trusted you and worked hard for you. If you hired
me and I busted my ass working for you, I expect you to have the courage to lay
me off yourself.

Once you make it clear that managers must lay off their own people, be sure
to prepare them for the task:


**1.** They should explain briefly what happened and that it is a company
rather than a personal failure.


**2.** They should be clear that the employee is impacted and that the decision
is nonnegotiable.


**3.** They should be fully prepared with all of the details about the benefits
and support the company plans to provide.


**STEP 5: ADDRESS THE ENTIRE COMPANY**


Prior to executing the layoff, the CEO must address the company. The CEO
must deliver the overall message that provides the proper context and air cover
for the managers. If you do your job right, the managers will have a much easier
time doing their jobs. Keep in mind what former Intuit CEO Bill Campbell told
me— _The message is for the people who are staying_ . The people who stay will
care deeply about how you treat their colleagues. Many of the people whom you
lay off will have closer relationships with the people who stay than you do, so
treat them with the appropriate level of respect. Still, the company must move
forward, so be careful not to apologize too much.


**STEP 6: BE VISIBLE, BE PRESENT**


After you make the speech telling your company that you will be letting many of
them go, you will not feel like hanging out and talking to people. You will
probably feel like going to a bar and drinking a fifth of tequila. Do not do this.
Be present. Be visible. Be engaging. People want to see you. They want to see
whether you care. The people whom you laid off will want to know if they still
have a relationship with you and the company. Talk to people. Help them carry
their things to their cars. Let them know that you appreciate their efforts.
