## **INTRODUCTION**

“This the real world, homie, school finished


They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it.”


**—KANYE WEST, “GORGEOUS”**

# **E**

very time I read a management or self-help book, I find myself saying, “That’s
fine, but that wasn’t really the hard thing about the situation.” The hard thing
isn’t setting a big, hairy, audacious goal. The hard thing is laying people off
when you miss the big goal. The hard thing isn’t hiring great people. The hard
thing is when those “great people” develop a sense of entitlement and start
demanding unreasonable things. The hard thing isn’t setting up an organizational
chart. The hard thing is getting people to communicate within the organization
that you just designed. The hard thing isn’t dreaming big. The hard thing is
waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat when the dream turns into a
nightmare.

The problem with these books is that they attempt to provide a recipe for
challenges that have no recipes. There’s no recipe for really complicated,
dynamic situations. There’s no recipe for building a high-tech company; there’s
no recipe for leading a group of people out of trouble; there’s no recipe for
making a series of hit songs; there’s no recipe for playing NFL quarterback;
there’s no recipe for running for president; and there’s no recipe for motivating
teams when your business has turned to crap. That’s the hard thing about hard
things—there is no formula for dealing with them.

Nonetheless, there are many bits of advice and experience that can help with
the hard things.

I do not attempt to present a formula in this book. Instead, I present my story
and the difficulties that I have faced. As an entrepreneur, a CEO, and now as a
venture capitalist, I still find these lessons useful—especially as I work with a
new generation of founder-CEOs. Building a company inevitably leads to tough


times. I’ve been there; I’ve done that. Circumstances may differ, but the deeper
patterns and the lessons keep resonating.

For the past several years, I’ve encapsulated these lessons in a series of blog
posts that have been read by millions of people. Many of those have reached out
to me wanting to know the backstory to the lessons. This book tells that
backstory for the first time and includes the related lessons from the blog. I’ve
also been inspired by many friends, advisers, and family members who have
helped me throughout my career and also by hip-hop/rap music. Because hiphop artists aspire to be both great and successful and see themselves as
entrepreneurs, many of the themes—competing, making money, being
misunderstood—provide insight into the hard things. I share my experiences in
the hope of providing clues and inspiration for others who find themselves in the
struggle to build something out of nothing.


**— CHAPTER 1 —**

## **FROM COMMUNIST TO VENTURE CAPITALIST**


“This here is all about


My wife, my kids, the life that I live


Through the night, I was his, it was right, but I did


My ups, and downs, my slips, my falls


My trials and tribulations, my heart, my balls.”


**—DMX, “WHO WE BE”**

# **T**

he other day I threw a big barbecue at my house and invited a hundred of my
closest friends. These types of gatherings aren’t unusual. My brother-in-law,
Cartheu, and I have been barbecuing for years, and my skills have earned me the
nickname from my African American friends “the Jackie Robinson of
Barbecue.” I crossed the color line.


At this particular barbecue, the conversation turned to the great rapper Nas.
My friend Tristan Walker, a young African American entrepreneur, commented
proudly that Nas was from his home project, Queensbridge, New York—one of
the largest public housing projects in the United States. My seventy-three-yearold Jewish father interjected, “I’ve been to Queensbridge.” Convinced that there
was no way that my old, white father had been to Queensbridge, Tristan said,
“You must mean _Queens_ . Queensbridge is actually a housing project in an
extremely rough neighborhood.” My father insisted: No, it was Queensbridge.

I pointed out to Tristan that my father grew up in Queens, so he couldn’t
possibly be confused. Then I asked, “Dad, what were you doing in
Queensbridge?” He replied, “I was passing out communist literature when I was
eleven years old. I remember it well, because my mother got very upset that the
Communist Party sent me into the projects. She thought it was too dangerous for
a little kid.”


My grandparents were actually card-carrying Communists. As an active
member in the Communist Party, my grandfather Phil Horowitz lost his job as a
schoolteacher during the McCarthy era. My father was a red-diaper baby and
grew up indoctrinated in the philosophy of the left. In 1968, he moved our
family west to Berkeley, California, and became editor of the famed New Left
magazine _Ramparts_ .

As a result, I grew up in the city affectionately known by its inhabitants as the
People’s Republic of Berkeley. As a young child, I was incredibly shy and
terrified of adults. When my mother dropped me off at nursery school for the
first time, I began to cry. The teacher told my mother to just leave, while
reassuring her that crying was common among nursery school children. But
when Elissa Horowitz returned three hours later, she found me soaking wet and
still crying. The teacher explained that I hadn’t stopped, and now my clothes
were drenched as a result. I got kicked out of nursery school that day. If my
mother hadn’t been the most patient person in the world, I might never have
gone to school. When everybody around her recommended psychiatric
treatment, she was patient, willing to wait until I got comfortable with the world,
no matter how long it took.

When I was five years old, we moved from a one-bedroom house on Glen
Avenue, which had become far too small for a six-person family, to a larger one
on Bonita Avenue. Bonita was middle-class Berkeley, which means something a
bit different from what one finds in most middle-class neighborhoods. The block
was a collection of hippies, crazy people, lower-class people working hard to
move up, and upper-class people taking enough drugs to move down. One day,
one of my older brother Jonathan’s friends, Roger (not his real name), was over
at our house. Roger pointed to an African American kid down the block who
was riding in a red wagon. Roger dared me: “Go down the street, tell that kid to
give you his wagon, and if he says anything, spit in his face and call him a
nigger.”

A few things require clarification here. First, we were in Berkeley, so that was
not common language. In fact, I had never heard the word _nigger_ before and
didn’t know what it meant, though I guessed it wasn’t a compliment. Second,
Roger wasn’t racist and he wasn’t raised in a bad home. His father was a
Berkeley professor and both his parents were some of the nicest people in the
world, but we later found out that Roger suffered from schizophrenia, and his
dark side wanted to see a fight.

Roger’s command put me in a difficult situation. I was terrified of Roger. I


thought that he would surely give me a severe beating if I didn’t follow his
instructions. On the other hand, I was terrified of asking for the wagon. Hell, I
was terrified of everything. I was much too scared of Roger to stay where I was,
so I began walking down the block toward the other kid. The distance was
probably thirty yards, but it felt like thirty miles. When I finally got there, I
could barely move. I did not know what to say, so I just opened my mouth and
started talking. “Can I ride in your wagon?” is what came out. Joel Clark Jr. said,
“Sure.” When I turned to see what Roger would do, he was gone. Apparently,
his light side had taken over and he’d moved on to something else. Joel and I
went on to play all day that day, and we’ve been best friends ever since.
Eighteen years later, he would be the best man at my wedding.

Until now, I’ve never told that story to anyone, but it shaped my life. It taught
me that being scared didn’t mean I was gutless. What I did _mattered_ and would
determine whether I would be a hero or a coward. I have often thought back on
that day, realizing that if I’d done what Roger had told me to do, I would have
never met my best friend. That experience also taught me not to judge things by
their surfaces. Until you make the effort to get to know someone or something,
you don’t know anything. There are no shortcuts to knowledge, especially
knowledge gained from personal experience. Following conventional wisdom
and relying on shortcuts can be worse than knowing nothing at all.

## **TURN YOUR SHIT IN**


Over the years, I worked hard to avoid being influenced by first impressions and
blindly adhering to convention. Growing up in Berkeley as an excellent student
in a town that frowned upon football as being too militaristic, I wasn’t expected
to join the Berkeley High School football team, but that’s what I did. This was a
big step for me. I had not played in any of the peewee football leagues, so it was
my first exposure to the sport. Nonetheless, those earlier lessons in dealing with
fear helped me tremendously. In high school football, being able to handle fear
is 75 percent of the game.

I will never forget the first team meeting with head coach Chico Mendoza.
Coach Mendoza was a tough old guy who had played college football at Texas
Christian University, home of the mighty Horned Frogs. Coach Mendoza began
his opening speech, “Some of you guys will come out here and you just won’t be
serious. You’ll get here and start shooting the shit, talking shit, bullshittin’, not
doing shit, and just want to look good in your football shit. If you do that, then
you know what? Turn your shit in.” He went on to elaborate on what was


unacceptable: “Come late to practice? Turn your shit in. Don’t want to hit? Turn
your shit in. Walk on the grass? Turn your shit in. Call me Chico? Turn your shit
in.”


It was the most intense, hilarious, poetic speech I’d ever heard. I loved it. I
couldn’t wait to get home and tell my mother. She was horrified, but I still loved
it. In retrospect, it was my first lesson in leadership. Former secretary of state
Colin Powell says that leadership is the ability to get someone to follow you
even if only out of curiosity. I was certainly curious to see what Coach Mendoza
would say next.

I was the only kid on the football team who was also on the highest academic
track in math, so my teammates and I didn’t see each other in many classes. As a
result, I ended up moving in multiple social circles and hanging out with kids
with very different outlooks on the world. It amazed me how a diverse
perspective utterly changed the meaning of every significant event in the world.
For instance, when Run-D.M.C.’s _Hard Times_ album came out, with its
relentless bass drum, it sent an earthquake through the football team, but not
even a ripple through my calculus class. Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense
Initiative was considered an outrage among young scientists due to its
questionable technical foundation, but those aspects went unnoticed at football
practice.

Looking at the world through such different prisms helped me separate facts
from perception. This ability would serve me incredibly well later when I
became an entrepreneur and CEO. In particularly dire circumstances when the
“facts” seemed to dictate a certain outcome, I learned to look for alternative
narratives and explanations coming from radically different perspectives to
inform my outlook. The simple existence of an alternate, plausible scenario is
often all that’s needed to keep hope alive among a worried workforce.

## **BLIND DATE**


In the summer of 1986, I had finished my sophomore year of college at
Columbia University, and I was staying with my father, who was now living in
Los Angeles. I had been set up on a blind date by my friend and high school
football teammate Claude Shaw. Claude and I got ready for the double date with
his girlfriend, Jackie Williams, and my date, Felicia Wiley, by preparing an
elaborate dinner. We meticulously planned and cooked all day and had the entire
meal, including four perfectly presented T-bone steaks, ready at 7 p.m.—date
time. But there were no dates. An hour passed, but we didn’t get too worked up.


Jackie was known for her tardiness, so no worries. Then two hours passed, and
Claude called for a status check. I listened in shock as I looked over the now
cold gourmet meal that we’d prepared. My date, Felicia, had decided that she
was “too tired” to show up for the date. Wow. How obnoxious!

I told Claude to hand me the phone. I introduced myself: “Hi, this is Ben, your
blind date.”


Felicia: “I am sorry, but I am tired and it is late.”
Me: “Well, it is late, because you are _late_ .”
Felicia: “I know, but I am just too tired to come over.”
At this point I decided to appeal to her sense of empathy.
Me: “Well, I understand your predicament, but the time to communicate this
message would have been before we spent all day cooking dinner. At this point,
anything short of getting into your car and driving here immediately would be
rude and leave a permanently poor impression.”

If she was totally self-centered (as she appeared to be), my plea would have
no effect, and I would be better off missing the date. On the other hand, if she
didn’t want to go out like that, then there might be something there.

Felicia: “Okay, I’ll come over.”
Ninety minutes later she arrived wearing white shorts and looking as pretty as
can be. In all my focus and anticipation about the date, I had completely
forgotten about the fistfight I’d been in the day before. During a pickup
basketball game in the San Fernando Valley, a six-foot-two-inch, crew-cutsporting, camouflage-pants-wearing, fraternity-boy-looking player threw the ball
at my brother. Jonathan was a musician, had long hair, and probably weighed
about 155 pounds at the time. On the other hand, I was used to football and
fighting and was ready for action. I judged the situation on my first impression,
and I rushed the frat boy. A scuffle ensued. I landed some good punches but
caught a right hook under my left eye, leaving a bit of a mark. It’s possible that
my target player was simply mad about a hard foul rather than trying to bully my
brother, but that’s the price of not taking the time to understand. I will never
know.


Whatever the case, when I opened the door to greet our dates, Felicia’s awardwinning green eyes immediately fixed on the welt under my eye. Her first
impression (told to me years later): “This guy is a thug. Coming here was a big
mistake.”


Fortunately, neither of us relied on our first impressions. We have been
happily married for nearly twenty-five years and have three wonderful children.


## **SILICON VALLEY**

During one summer in college, I got a job as an engineer at a company called
Silicon Graphics (SGI). The experience blew my mind. The company invented
modern computer graphics and powered a whole new class set of applications
ranging from the movie _Terminator 2_ to amazing flight simulators. Everybody
there was so smart. The things they built were so cool. I wanted to work for
Silicon Graphics for the rest of my life.

After graduating from college and graduate school in computer science, I went
back to work for SGI. Being there was a dream come true and I loved it. After
my first year at SGI, I met a former head of marketing for the company, Roselie
Buonauro, who had a new startup. Roselie had heard about me from her
daughter, who also worked with me at SGI. Roselie recruited me hard.
Eventually, she got me and I went to work for her at NetLabs.

Joining NetLabs turned out to be a horrible decision for me. The company was
run by Andre Schwager, a former Hewlett-Packard executive, and more
important, Roselie’s husband. Andre and Roselie had been brought in by the
venture capitalists as the “professional management team.” Unfortunately, they
understood very little about the products or the technology, and they sent the
company off in one crazy direction after the next. This was the first time that I
started to understand the importance of founders running their companies.

To make matters more complicated, my second daughter, Mariah, had been
diagnosed with autism, which made working at a startup a terrible burden for our
family, as I needed to spend more time at home.

One very hot day my father came over for a visit. We could not afford airconditioning, and all three children were crying as my father and I sat there
sweating in the 105-degree heat.

My father turned to me and said, “Son, do you know what’s cheap?”
Since I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, I replied, “No,
what?”


“Flowers. Flowers are really cheap. But do you know what’s expensive?” he
asked.


Again, I replied, “No, what?”
He said, “Divorce.”
Something about that joke, which was not really a joke, made me realize that I
had run out of time. Up until that point, I had not really made any serious
choices. I felt like I had unlimited bandwidth and could do everything in life that


I wanted to do simultaneously. But his joke made it suddenly clear that by
continuing on the course I was on, I might lose my family. By doing everything,
I would fail at the most important thing. It was the first time that I forced myself
to look at the world through priorities that were not purely my own. I thought
that I could pursue my career, all my interests, and build my family. More
important, I always thought about myself first. When you are part of a family or
part of a group, that kind of thinking can get you into trouble, and I was in deep
trouble. In my mind, I was confident that I was a good person and not selfish,
but my actions said otherwise. I had to stop being a boy and become a man. I
had to put first things first. I had to consider the people who I cared about most
before considering myself.

I decided to quit NetLabs the next day. I found a job at Lotus Development
that would allow me to get my home life straightened out. I stopped thinking
about myself and focused on what was best for my family. I started being the
person that I wanted to be.

## **NETSCAPE**


One day while working at Lotus, one of my coworkers showed me a new
product called Mosaic, which was developed by some students at the University
of Illinois. Mosaic was essentially a graphical interface to the Internet—a
technology formerly only used by scientists and researchers. It amazed me. It
was so obviously the future, and I was so obviously wasting my time working on
anything but the Internet.

Several months later, I read about a company called Netscape, which had been
cofounded by former Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark and Mosaic inventor
Marc Andreessen. I instantly decided that I should interview for a job there. I
called a friend who worked at Netscape and asked if he could get me an
interview with the company. He obliged and I was on my way.

During the first interviews, I met everyone on the product management team. I
thought the meetings went well, but when I arrived home that evening Felicia
was in tears. The Netscape recruiter had called me to give me some tips, and
Felicia had answered. (This was before the days of pervasive cell phones.) The
recruiter informed her that it would be unlikely I’d get the job, because the group
was looking for candidates with Stanford or Harvard MBAs. Felicia suggested
that maybe I could go back to school. Given that we had three children, she
knew this was unrealistic, hence the tears. I explained that recruiters were not
hiring managers, and that they might consider me despite my lack of proper


business schooling.

The next day the hiring manager called back to let me know that they wanted
me to interview with cofounder and Chief Technical Officer Marc Andreessen.

He was twenty-two years old at the time.

In retrospect, it’s easy to think both the Web browser and the Internet were
inevitable, but without Marc’s work, it is likely that we would be living in a very
different world. At the time most people believed only scientists and researchers
would use the Internet. The Internet was thought to be too arcane, insecure, and
slow to meet real business needs. Even after the introduction of Mosaic, the
world’s first browser, almost nobody thought the Internet would be significant
beyond the scientific community—least of all the most important technology
industry leaders, who were busy building proprietary alternatives. The
overwhelming favorites to dominate the race to become the so-called
Information Superhighway were competing proprietary technologies from
industry powerhouses such as Oracle and Microsoft. Their stories captured the
imagination of the business press. This was not so illogical, since most
companies didn’t even run TCP/IP (the software foundation for the Internet)—
they ran proprietary networking protocols such as AppleTalk, NetBIOS, and
SNA. As late as November 1995, Bill Gates wrote a book titled _The Road_
_Ahead_, in which he predicted that the Information Superhighway—a network
connecting all businesses and consumers in a world of frictionless commerce—
would be the logical successor to the Internet and would rule the future. Gates
later went back and changed references from the Information Superhighway to
the Internet, but that was not his original vision.

The implications of this proprietary vision were not good for business or for
consumers. In the minds of visionaries like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison, the
corporations that owned the Information Superhighway would tax every
transaction by charging a “vigorish,” as Microsoft’s then–chief technology
officer, Nathan Myhrvold, referred to it.

It’s difficult to overstate the momentum that the proprietary Information
Superhighway carried. After Mosaic, even Marc and his cofounder, Jim Clark,
originally planned a business for video distribution to run on top of the
proprietary Information Superhighway, not the Internet. It wasn’t until deep into
the planning process that they decided that by improving the browser to make it
secure, more functional, and easier to use, they could make the Internet the
network of the future. And that became the mission of Netscape—a mission that
they would gloriously accomplish.


Interviewing with Marc was like no other job interview I’d ever had. Gone
were questions about my résumé, my career progression, and my work habits.
He replaced them with a dizzying inquiry into the history of email, collaboration
software, and what the future might hold. I was an expert in the topic, because
I’d spent the last several years working on the leading products in the category,
but I was shocked by how much a twenty-two-year-old kid knew about the
history of the computer business. I’d met many really smart young people in my
career, but never a young technology historian. Marc’s intellect and instincts
took me aback, but beyond Marc’s historical knowledge, his insights about
technologies such as replication were incisive and on point. After the interview, I
phoned my brother and told him that I’d just interviewed with Marc Andreessen,
and I thought that he might be the smartest person I’d ever met.

A week later, I got the job. I was thrilled. I didn’t really care what the offer
was. I knew that Marc and Netscape would change the world, and I wanted to be
part of it. I could not wait to get started.

Once at Netscape, I was put in charge of their Enterprise Web Server product
line. The line consisted of two products: the regular Web server, which listed for
$1,200, and the secure Web server (a Web server that included the then brandnew security protocol invented by Netscape called SSL, Secure Sockets Layer)
for $5,000. At the time that I joined, we had two engineers working on the Web
servers: Rob McCool, who had invented the NCSA Web server, and his twin
brother, Mike McCool.

By the time Netscape went public in August 1995, we had grown the Web
server team to about nine engineers. The Netscape initial public offering (IPO)
was both spectacular and historic. The stock initially priced at $14 per share, but
a last-minute decision doubled the initial offering to $28 per share. It spiked to
$75—nearly a record for a first-day gain—and closed at $58, giving Netscape a
market value of nearly $3 billion on the day of the IPO. More than that, the IPO
was an earthquake in the business world. As my friend and investment banker
Frank Quattrone said at the time, “No one wanted to tell their grandchildren that
they missed out on this one.”

The deal changed everything. Microsoft had been in business for more than a
decade before its IPO; we’d been alive for sixteen months. Companies began to
get defined as “new economy” or as “old economy.” And the new economy was
winning. The _New York Times_ called the Netscape IPO “world-shaking.”

But there was a crack in our armor: Microsoft announced that it would be

bundling its browser, Internet Explorer, with its upcoming breakthrough


operating system release, Windows 95—for free. This posed a huge problem to
Netscape, because nearly all of our revenue came from browser sales, and
Microsoft controlled more than 90 percent of operating systems. Our answer to
investors: We would make our money on Web servers.

Two months later, we got our hands on an early release of Microsoft’s
upcoming Web server Internet Information Server (IIS). We deconstructed IIS
and found that it had every feature that we had—including the security in our
high-end product—and was five times faster. Uh-oh. I figured that we had about
five months before Microsoft released IIS to solve the problem or else we would
be toast. In the “old economy,” product cycles typically took eighteen months to
complete, so this was an exceptionally short time frame even in the “new
economy.” So I went to see our department head, Mike Homer.

With the possible exception of Marc, Mike Homer was the most significant
creative force behind Netscape. More important, the worse a situation became,
the stronger Mike would get. During particularly brutal competitive attacks,
most executives would run from the press. Mike, on the other hand, was always
front and center. When Microsoft unveiled its famous “embrace and extend”

strategy—a dramatic pivot to attack Netscape—Mike took every phone call,
sometimes even talking to two reporters at once with a phone in each hand. He
was the ultimate warrior.


Mike and I spent the next several months developing a comprehensive answer
to Microsoft’s threat. If they were going to give our products away, then we
were going to offer a dirt-cheap, open alternative to the highly expensive and
proprietary Microsoft BackOffice product line. To do so, we acquired two
companies, which provided us with a competitive alternative to Microsoft
Exchange. We then cut a landmark deal with the database company Informix to
provide us unlimited relational database access through the Web for $50 a copy,
which was literally hundreds of times less than Microsoft charged. Once we
assembled the entire package, Mike named it Netscape SuiteSpot, as it would be
the “suite” that displaced Microsoft’s BackOffice. We lined everything up for a
major launch on March 5, 1996, in New York.

Then, just two weeks before the launch, Marc, without telling Mike or me,
revealed the entire strategy to the publication _Computer Reseller News_ . I was
livid. I immediately sent him a short email:


To: Marc Andreessen

Cc: Mike Homer


From: Ben Horowitz

Subject : Launch
I guess we’re not going to wait until the 5th to launch the strategy.
— Ben


Within fifteen minutes, I received the following reply.


To: Ben Horowitz

Cc: Mike Homer, Jim Barksdale (CEO), Jim Clark (Chairman)
From: Marc Andreessen

Subject: Re: Launch
Apparently you do not understand how serious the situation is. We are
getting killed killed killed out there. Our current product is radically worse
than the competition. We’ve had nothing to say for months. As a result,
we’ve lost over $3B in market capitalization. We are now in danger of
losing the entire company and it’s all server product management’s fault.

Next time do the fucking interview yourself.
Fuck you,
Marc


I received this email the same day that Marc appeared barefoot and sitting on
a throne on the cover of _Time_ magazine. When I first saw the cover, I felt
thrilled. I had never met anyone in my life who had been on the cover of _Time_ .
Then I felt sick. I brought both the magazine and the email home to Felicia to get
a second opinion. I was very worried. I was twenty-nine years old, had a wife
and three children, and needed my job. She looked at the email and the magazine
cover and said, “You need to start looking for a job right away.”

In the end, I didn’t get fired and over the next two years, SuiteSpot grew from
nothing to a $400 million a year business. More shocking, Marc and I eventually
became friends; we’ve been friends and business partners ever since.

People often ask me how we’ve managed to work effectively across three
companies over eighteen years. Most business relationships either become too
tense to tolerate or not tense enough to be productive after a while. Either people
challenge each other to the point where they don’t like each other or they
become complacent about each other’s feedback and no longer benefit from the
relationship. With Marc and me, even after eighteen years, he upsets me almost
every day by finding something wrong in my thinking, and I do the same for
him. It works.


## **STARTING A COMPANY**

At the end of 1998 and under immense pressure from Microsoft, which used the
full force of its operating system monopoly to subsidize free products in every
category in which Netscape competed, we sold the company to America Online
(AOL). In the short term, this was a big victory for Microsoft since it had driven
its biggest threat into the arms of a far less threatening competitor. In the long
term, however, Netscape inflicted irreparable damage on Microsoft’s stronghold
on the computing industry: our work moved developers from Win32 API,
Microsoft’s proprietary platform, to the Internet. Someone writing new
functionality for computers no longer wrote for Microsoft’s proprietary platform.
Instead, they wrote to the Internet and World Wide Web’s standard interfaces.
Once Microsoft lost its grip on developers, it became only a matter of time
before it lost its monopoly on operating systems. Along the way, Netscape
invented many of the foundational technologies of the modern Internet,
including JavaScript, SSL, and cookies.

Once inside AOL, I was assigned to run the e-commerce platform and Marc
became the chief technology officer. After a few months, it became apparent to
both of us that AOL saw itself as more of a media company than a technology
company. Technology enabled great new media projects, but the strategy was a
media strategy and the top executive, Bob Pittman, was a genius media
executive. Media companies focused on things like creating great stories
whereas technology companies focused on creating a better way of doing things.
We began to think about new ideas and about forming a new company.

In the process, we added two other potential cofounders to the discussion. Dr.
Timothy Howes was coinventor of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP), a masterful simplification of its byzantine X.500 predecessor. We hired
Tim into Netscape in 1996 and together we successfully made LDAP the
Internet directory standard. To this day, if a program is interested in information
about a person, it accesses that information via LDAP. The fourth member of
our team was In Sik Rhee, who had cofounded an application server company
called Kiva Systems, which Netscape had acquired. He had been acting as CTO
of the e-commerce division that I ran and, in particular, worked closely with the
partner companies in making sure that they could handle the AOL scale.

As we discussed ideas, In Sik complained that every time we tried to connect
an AOL partner on the AOL e-commerce platform, the partner’s site would
crash, because it couldn’t handle the traffic load. Deploying software to scale to


millions of users was totally different from making it work for thousands. And it
was extremely complicated.

Hmm, there ought to be a company that does all that for them.
As we expanded the idea, we landed on the concept of a computing cloud. The
term _cloud_ had been used previously in the telecommunications industry to
describe the smart cloud that handled all the complexity of routing, billing, and
the like, so that one could plug a dumb device into the smart cloud and get all the
smart functionality for free. We thought the same concept was needed in
computing, so that software developers wouldn’t have to worry about security,
scaling, and disaster recovery. And if you are going to build a cloud, it should be
big and loud, and that’s how Loudcloud was born. Interestingly, the most lasting
remnant of Loudcloud is the name itself, as the word _cloud_ hadn’t been
previously used to describe a computing platform.

We incorporated the company and set out to raise money. It was 1999.


**— CHAPTER 2 —**

## **“I WILL SURVIVE”**


“Did you think I’d crumble?


Did you think I’d lay down and die?


Oh no, not I


I will survive.”


**—GLORIA GAYNOR, “I WILL SURVIVE”**

# C oming off the success of Netscape, Marc knew all the top venture capitalists in

Silicon Valley, so we needed no introductions. Unfortunately for us, Kleiner
Perkins, the firm that backed Netscape, had already funded a potentially
competitive company. We spoke to all the other top-tier firms and decided to go
with Andy Rachleff of Benchmark Capital.

If I had to describe Andy with one word, it would be _gentleman_ . Smart,
refined, and gracious, Andy was a brilliant abstract thinker who could
encapsulate complex strategies into pithy sentences with ease. Benchmark would
invest $15 million at a pre-money valuation (the value of the company before the
cash goes into the company treasury) of $45 million. In addition, Marc would
invest $6 million, bringing the total value of the company including its cash to
$66 million, and would serve as our “full-time chairman of the board.” Tim
Howes would be our chief technology officer. I would be CEO. Loudcloud was
two months old.


The valuation and the size of the funding were signs of the times and created
an imperative to get big and capture the market before similarly well-funded
competitors could. Andy said to me, “Ben, think about how you might run the
business if capital were free.”

Two months later, we would raise an additional $45 million from Morgan
Stanley in debt with no covenants and no payments for three years, so Andy’s


question was more reality-based than you might think. Nonetheless, “What
would you do if capital were free?” is a dangerous question to ask an
entrepreneur. It’s kind of like asking a fat person, “What would you do if ice
cream had the exact same nutritional value as broccoli?” The thinking this
question leads to can be extremely dangerous.

Naturally, I took the advice and ran with it. We quickly built out our cloud
infrastructure and began signing up customers at a rapid rate. Within seven
months of founding, we’d already booked $10 million in contracts. Loudcloud
was taking off, but we were in a race against time and the competition. This
meant hiring the best people and fielding the broadest cloud service, and that
meant spending money—lots of it.

Our ninth hire was a recruiter, and we hired a human resources person when
we had a dozen employees. We were hiring thirty employees a month and
snagging many of the Valley’s smartest people. One of our new recruits had quit
his job at AOL to spend two months mountain climbing, but instead he joined
us; another forfeited millions to join Loudcloud when he resigned from another
company on the day of its IPO. Six months in, we had nearly two hundred
employees.

Silicon Valley was on fire, and Loudcloud was billed in a _Wired_ cover story
as “Marc Andreessen’s second coming.” We traded our first office—where
you’d blow a circuit if you ran the microwave and coffeemaker at the same time
—for a fifteen-thousand-square-foot warehouse in Sunnyvale, which was too
small for us by the time we moved in.

We spent $5 million to move into a new three-story stucco building with jadecolored tiles we called “the Taj” (as in the Taj Mahal). It was also too small to
keep pace with our hiring frenzy, and people were sitting in the hallways. We
rented a third parking lot down the street and ran shuttle vans to the office. (The
neighbors hated us.) The kitchen was stocked like Costco, and when we fired the
snack contractor for making our fridge look like the one in Philip Roth’s
_Goodbye, Columbus_, he asked for equity.

This was the time.
In the next quarter, we booked $27 million worth of new contracts, and we
were less than nine months old. It seemed like we were building the greatest
business of all time. Then came the great dot-com crash. The NASDAQ peaked
at 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000—more than double its value from the year before
—and then fell by 10 percent ten days later. A _Barron’s_ cover story titled
“Burning Up” predicted what was to come. By April, after the government


declared Microsoft a monopoly, the index plummeted even further. Startups lost
massive value, investors lost massive wealth, and dot-coms, once heralded as the
harbinger of a new economy, went out of business almost overnight and became
known as dot-bombs. The NASDAQ eventually fell below 1,200, an 80 percent
drop from its peak.

We thought our business might have been the fastest growing of all time at
that point. That was the good news. The bad news was that we needed to raise
even more money in this disastrous climate; nearly all of the $66 million in
equity and debt we had raised had already been deployed in our quest to build
the number-one cloud service and to support our now fast-growing set of

customers.


The dot-com crash had spooked investors, so raising money wasn’t going to
be easy, especially since most of our customers were dot-com startups. This
became quite clear when we pitched the deal to the Japanese firm Softbank
Capital. My friend and Loudcloud board member Bill Campbell knew the
Softbank people well and offered to get some “back-channel” information
following the pitch. When my assistant told me that Bill was on the line, I
quickly answered the phone. I was eager to hear where we stood.

I asked, “Bill, what did they say?” Bill replied in his raspy, coach’s voice,
“Ben, well, honestly, they thought you were smoking crack.” With nearly three
hundred employees and very little cash left, I felt like I was going to die. It was
the first time I’d felt that way as CEO of Loudcloud, but not nearly the last.

During this time I learned the most important rule of raising money privately:
Look for a market of one. You only need one investor to say yes, so it’s best to
ignore the other thirty who say “no.” We eventually found investors for a series
C round (meaning our third round of funding) at an amazing $700 million premoney valuation and raised $120 million. The sales forecast for the quarter came
in at $100 million, and things seemed like they might be okay. I felt confident
that our sales forecasts would hold up given that previous forecasts had
underestimated actual performance. And perhaps, I speculated, we could
seamlessly migrate our customer base away from dot-com bombs to more stable,
traditional customers such as Nike, our largest customer at the time.

And then the wheels came off.
We finished the third quarter of 2000 with $37 million in bookings—not the
$100 million that we had forecast. The dot-com implosion turned out to be far
more catastrophic than we had predicted.


## **EUPHORIA AND TERROR**

I needed to raise money yet again. Only this time the environment was even
worse. In the fourth quarter of 2000, I met with every possible funding source,
including Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, but nobody was willing
to invest money at any valuation. We’d gone from being the hottest startup in
Silicon Valley to unfundable in six months. With 477 employees and a business
that resembled a ticking time bomb, I searched for answers.

Thinking about what might happen if we ran completely out of money—
laying off all the employees that I’d so carefully selected and hired, losing all my
investors’ money, jeopardizing all the customers who trusted us with their
business—made it difficult to concentrate on the possibilities. Marc Andreessen
attempted to cheer me up with a not-so-funny-at-the-time joke:

Marc: “Do you know the best thing about startups?”
Ben: “What?”

Marc: “You only ever experience two emotions: euphoria and terror. And I
find that lack of sleep enhances them both.”

With the clock ticking, one unattractive but intriguing option emerged: We
could go public. In an oddity of the times, the private funding market shut down
for companies with our profile, but the window on the public market remained
just slightly open. This may sound like a crazy anomaly and it was, but private
funds had become completely cynical while the public markets were only 80
percent of the way there.

With no other options available, I needed to propose to the board that we go
public. In order to prepare, I made a list of the pros and cons of an IPO.

I knew that Bill Campbell would be the critical person I’d need to persuade
one way or another. Bill was the only one of our board members who had been a
public company CEO. He knew the pros and cons better than anyone else. More
important, everybody always seemed to defer to Bill in these kinds of sticky
situations, because Bill had a special quality about him.

At the time, Bill was in his sixties, with gray hair and a gruff voice, yet he had
the energy of a twenty-year-old. He began his career as a college football coach
and did not enter the business world until he was forty. Despite the late start, Bill
eventually became the chairman and CEO of Intuit. Following that, he became a
legend in high tech, mentoring great CEOs such as Steve Jobs of Apple, Jeff
Bezos of Amazon, and Eric Schmidt of Google.

Bill is extremely smart, super-charismatic, and elite operationally, but the key


to his success goes beyond those attributes. In any situation—whether it’s the
board of Apple, where he’s served for over a decade; the Columbia University
Board of Trustees, where he is chairman; or the girls’ football team that he
coaches—Bill is inevitably everybody’s favorite person.

People offer many complex reasons for why Bill rates so highly. In my
experience it’s pretty simple. No matter who you are, you need two kinds of
friends in your life. The first kind is one you can call when something good
happens, and you need someone who will be excited for you. Not a fake
excitement veiling envy, but a real excitement. You need someone who will
actually be more excited for you than he would be if it had happened to him. The
second kind of friend is somebody you can call when things go horribly wrong
—when your life is on the line and you only have one phone call. Who is it
going to be? Bill Campbell is both of those friends.

I presented my thinking as follows: “We have not been able to find any
investors in the private markets. Our choices are to either keep working on
private funding or start preparing to go public. While our prospects for raising
money privately seem quite difficult, going public has a large number of issues:


“Our sales processes are not robust and it’s difficult to forecast in any
environment.


“We are not in any environment; we are in a rapidly declining
environment and it’s not clear where the bottom is.


“Our customers are going bankrupt at an alarming and unpredictable rate.


“We are losing money and will be losing money for quite some time.


“We are not operationally sound.


“In general, we are not ready to be public.”


The board listened carefully. Their expressions showed deep concern with the
issues I’d raised and an awkwardly long silence ensued. As expected, Bill broke
the dead air.


“Ben, it’s not the money.”
I felt a strange sense of relief. Maybe we didn’t have to go public. Maybe I’d
overestimated our cash problems. Perhaps there was another way.

Then Bill spoke again, “It’s the _fucking_ money.”
Okay, I guess we’re going public.
In addition to the issues I had outlined for the board, our business was


complex and hard for investors to understand. We typically signed customers to
two-year contracts, and then recognized the revenue monthly. This model is now
common, but it was quite unusual then. Given the fast growth in our bookings,
revenue lagged behind new bookings by quite a bit. As a result, our S-1 (our
registration with the SEC) stated that we had $1.94 million in trailing six months
revenue, and we forecast $75 million for the following year—an incredibly steep
revenue ramp. Since earnings are driven by revenue and not bookings, we had
gigantic losses. In addition, the stock option rules at the time made it seem like
our losses were about four times as large as they actually were. These factors led
to extremely negative press heading into the IPO.

A scathing story in _Red Herring_, for instance, noted that our list of customers
was “quite thin” and that we were too reliant on dot-coms. It quoted a Yankee
Group analyst positing that we had “lost something like $1 million dollars per
employee over the last 12 months,” and conjecturing that the way we did it was
by having a bonfire in the parking lot and getting everyone busy burning dollar
bills. _BusinessWeek_ took us apart in an article that declared us “the IPO from
hell.” A _Wall Street Journal_ cover piece quoted a money manager’s reaction to
our offering as “Wow, they were desperate.” One financier—who actually
invested in the offering—called it “the best option among a particularly ugly set
of options.”

Despite the horrifying press, we prepared to hit the road. Benchmarking
ourselves against comparable companies, we settled on the price of the offering
at $10 per share after an upcoming reverse split, which would value the company
at just under $700 million—less than the valuation from the previous private
round of financing, but much better than bankruptcy.

It was not at all clear that we would be successful with the offering. The stock
market was crashing, and the public market investors we visited were visibly
distressed.


At the end of the preparation process and after the banks had signed off, our
director of finance, Scott Kupor, received a call from our banker at Morgan
Stanley.

Banker: “Scott, did you know that $27.6 million of your cash is restricted and
tied up in real estate commitments?”

Scott: “Yes, of course.”
Banker: “So, you have just over three weeks’ worth of cash before you go
bankrupt?”

Scott: “Yes.”


Scott then relayed the conversation to me, saying, “Can you believe they
underwrote the deal and didn’t notice that the cash was restricted until now? We

gave them all the documents.”

Right before we were to leave for the IPO road show, I called an all-company
meeting to share two pieces of news: First, we were going public, or at least we
were going to try to go public. Second, the company had fallen so far in value
that we would have to reverse split the stock two for one.

I thought the first part would go okay, but I was worried about how the second
piece of news would be received. We had to reverse split the stock to get the
price per share high enough to go public. In theory, a reverse split shouldn’t
matter at all. Each employee owned a certain percentage of the company. The
company had a total number of shares of stock. Multiply the total number of
shares by the percentage, and you get the employees’ share number. Cut the
number of shares in half and, while employees would have half the number of
shares, they’d still own the exact same percentage of the company. Nothing
changed.

Oh, but it did. As we grew from zero to six hundred employees in less than
eighteen months, the stage was set for hyperbole and momentum. Some overly
excited managers oversold the dream. They spoke only in terms of shares rather
than in percentages and spun stories of a potential $100 per share stock price.
Employees then calculated their fantasy price per share and figured out how
much money they would make. I was aware that this was going on, but I never
thought we would reverse split the stock, so I never worried about it. Like many
other things that I screwed up during that period, I should have worried.

My wife, Felicia, came to the all-company meeting as she always did. This
time her parents were in town, so they came, too. The meeting did not go well.
People did not realize how close to the edge we were, so the news of the IPO
didn’t make anyone happy. The news of the reverse split made them even less
happy—in fact, it infuriated them. I had literally cut their fantasy number in half,
and they were not pleased about it. Nobody said harsh things directly to me. My
in-laws, however, heard everything. And, as my father-in-law put it, “it wasn’t
nothin’ nice.”


My mother-in-law, Loretta, asked my wife, “Why does everybody hate Ben so
much?” Felicia, who is normally the most electric, outgoing person in any room,
was just recovering from hernia surgery so she wasn’t her normal bubbly self.
She was discouraged. My in-laws were depressed. The employees were pissed. I
had no idea if I’d be able to raise the money. What a way to start a road show, an


event that’s usually the cause of a bit more fanfare.

The road show was brutal. The stock market crashed daily, and technology
stocks were to blame. Investors looked like they’d come out of torture chambers
when we arrived. One mutual fund manager looked right at Marc and me and
asked, “Why are you here? Do you have any idea what’s going on in the world?”
I thought that there was no way we’d be able to raise the money. We were going
to go bankrupt for sure. I did not sleep more than two hours total during that
entire three-week trip.

Three days into the tour, I received a call from my father-in-law. John Wiley
had been through a lot in his seventy-one years. As a boy, his father was
murdered in Texas. In order to survive, he and his mother moved in with an
unkind man and his nine children. There, John was abused, made to stay in the
barn with the animals, while the other children ate his dinner. Eventually, John
and his mother left that cruelty by walking for three days down a dirt road,
carrying everything they owned. John would recall that journey in great detail
his entire life. As a young man, before finishing his high school education, he
left home to fight in the Korean War so that he could support his mother. As a
young father of five, he took every job imaginable to support his family,
including unloading banana boats and working to build the Alaskan pipeline. He
tragically saw two of his children die before he reached the age of sixty. He had
a hard life and was used to bad news.


John Wiley did not call me for casual reasons. If he called, it was serious,
possibly even deadly serious.

Ben: “Hello.”

John: “Ben, the office said not to bother you, but I just want to let you know
that Felicia stopped breathing, but she is not going to die.”

Ben: “Not going to die? What?!?! What happened?”
I could not believe it. I had been so focused on work that I had lost focus of

the only thing that really mattered to me. Once again, I neglected to worry about
the one thing that I should have worried about.

Ben: “What happened?”
John: “They gave her some medicine and she had an allergic reaction and she
stopped breathing, but she’s okay now.”

Ben: “When?”

John: “Yesterday.”
Ben: “What? Why didn’t you tell me?”
John: “I knew that you were busy and that you were really in trouble at work


because of that meeting that I went to.”

Ben: “Should I come home?”

John: “Oh no. We’ll take care of her. You just take care of what you need to
do.”


I was completely stunned. I started sweating so hard that I had to change my
clothes right after the call. I had no idea what to do. If I returned home, the
company would surely go bankrupt. If I stayed . . . how could I stay? I called
back and had him put Felicia on the phone.

Ben: “If you need me, I will come home.”
Felicia: “No. Get the IPO done. There is no tomorrow for you and the
company. I’ll be fine.”

I stumbled through the rest of the road show completely discombobulated.
One day I wore a mismatching suit jacket and suit pants, which Marc pointed out
to me midway through the meeting. I had no idea where I was half the time.
During the three weeks we were on the road, comparable companies in our
market lost half of their value, which meant that our $10 share price was roughly
double the current benchmark. The bankers recommended that we lower the
price of the offering to $6 a share in order to reflect this new reality, but they
gave us no assurance that the deal would actually get done. Then, the day before
the offering, Yahoo, the lighthouse company of the Internet boom, announced
Tim Koogle, its CEO, was stepping down. We had hit the nadir of the dot-com
crash.

The Loudcloud offering finally sold at $6 a share, and we raised $162.5
million, but there was no celebration and no party. Neither Goldman Sachs nor
Morgan Stanley—the two banks that took us public—even offered us the
traditional closing dinner. It may have been the least celebratory IPO in history.
But Felicia was feeling better, and we had pulled it off. In a brief moment of
lightheartedness on the plane ride home, I turned to Scott Kupor, my director of
finance, and said, “We did it!” He replied, “Yeah, but we’re still fucked.”

Years later, in 2012, after Yahoo fired its CEO, Scott Thompson, Felicia
mused, “Should they bring back Koogle?” I replied, “Tim Koogle? How do you
even know who Tim Koogle is?” She then relived the conversation we’d had
eleven years earlier. It went something like this:

Ben: “We’re fucked.”

Felicia: “What do you mean? What happened?”
Ben: “Yahoo fired Koogle. It’s over. The whole thing is over.”
Felicia: “Who is Koogle?”


Ben: “He was the CEO of Yahoo. We’re fucked. I’m going to have to shut the
company down.”

Felicia: “Are you sure?”
Ben: “Didn’t you hear me? They fired Koogle. We’re fucked.”
She had never seen me that depressed before, and she never forgot it. For most
CEOs, the night before their public offering is a highlight. For me, it was a
highlight of depression.

## **IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT SHIT, DON’T NIBBLE**


During the road show, as a way to break the tension, Marc would say,
“Remember, Ben, things are always darkest before they go completely black.”
He was joking, but as we entered our first quarter as a public company, those
words seemed prescient. Customers continued to churn, the macroeconomic
environment worsened, and our sales prospects declined. As we got closer to our
first earnings call with investors, I conducted a thorough review to make sure
that we were still on track to meet our guidance.

The good news was that we would meet our forecast for the quarter. The bad
news: There was very little chance that we would meet our forecast for the year.
Typically, investors expect that companies will refrain from going public if they
can’t hit at least their first year’s forecast. These were exceptional times, but
resetting guidance on your very first earnings call was still a very bad thing to
do.


As we discussed where to reset guidance to investors, we were faced with a
tough choice: Should we try to minimize the initial damage by taking down the
number as little as possible or should we minimize the risk of another reset? If
we reduced the number by a lot, the stock might fall apart. On the other hand, if
we didn’t lower it enough, we might have to reset again, which would cost us all
the credibility we had left. My controller, Dave Conte, raised his hand with what
would be the definitive advice: “No matter what we say, we’re going to get
killed. As soon as we reset guidance, we’ll have no credibility with investors, so
we might as well take all the pain now, because nobody will believe any
positivity in the forecast anyway. If you are going to eat shit, don’t nibble.” So
we reset guidance for the year, slashing our original forecast of $75 million in
projected revenue to $55 million.

Resetting revenue guidance also meant resetting expense guidance, and that
meant laying people off. We’d been the darling of the startup world, and now I
had to send home 15 percent of our employees. It was the clearest indication yet


that I was failing. Failing my investors, failing my employees, and failing
myself.

Following the reset, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—the investment
banks that had taken us public—both dropped research coverage, meaning their
analysts would no longer follow the company’s progress on behalf of their
clients. This was a huge slap in the face and a massive reneging of the promises
they made when they were pitching us, but times were tough all around, and we
had no recourse. With a vote of no confidence from our banks and a lowered
revenue forecast, the stock price plummeted from $6 a share to $2.

Despite the mammoth negative momentum, we soldiered on, and were putting
together a fairly strong quarter in the third quarter of 2001. Then, on September
11, terrorists hijacked four jetliners, flying two into the World Trade Center and
another into the Pentagon, and in the end throwing the whole world into chaos. It
turned out that our largest deal that quarter was with the British government. It
represented one-third of our bookings, and we would miss the quarter’s targets
badly without it. Our champion on the deal called to inform us that Prime
Minister Tony Blair had redirected the funds for our deal to the war chest—
literally. By some miracle our sales director convinced one of Tony Blair’s
staffers to get the money back, so we got the deal and made the quarter.

Nonetheless, the close call was a sign to me that the entire operation was far
too fragile. I got another sign when our largest competitor, Exodus, filed for
bankruptcy on September 26. It was a truly incredible bankruptcy in that the
company had been valued at $50 billion a little more than a year earlier. It was
also remarkable because Exodus had raised $800 million on a “fully funded
plan” just nine months earlier. An Exodus executive later joked to me: “When
we drove off the cliff, we left no skid marks.” If Exodus could lose $50 billion in
market capitalization and $800 million in cash that fast, I needed a backup plan.

In my first attempt at a “Plan B,” we evaluated acquiring Data Return, a
company like ours that focused more on Windows applications than Unix
applications as we did. We studied the deal for weeks, modeling what the two
companies might look like together, figuring out product offerings and cost
synergies. My CFO at the time was extremely excited about the deal since it
would make use of his favorite skill set—cost cutting.

Toward the end of the process, I took a two-day vacation to Ashland, Oregon.
Almost as soon as I arrived, I received an urgent call from John O’Farrell, who
was in charge of corporate and business development.

John: “Ben, sorry to disturb you on vacation, but we just had a meeting on the


Data Return deal and I don’t think that we should do it.”


Ben: “Why not?”
John: “Quite frankly, our business is in trouble and their business is in trouble
and putting them together will just be double trouble.”

Ben: “I was thinking the exact same thing.”
In fact, looking at Data Return’s business made it crystal clear to me that
Loudcloud would probably not end well. Some things are much easier to see in
others than in yourself. Looking at Data Return, I could see Loudcloud’s future,
and it was not pretty. I had a great deal of trouble sleeping as I thought about our
fate. I tried to make myself feel better by asking, “What’s the worst thing that
could happen?” The answer always came back the same: “We’ll go bankrupt, I’ll
lose everybody’s money including my mother’s, I’ll have to lay off all the
people who have been working so hard in a very bad economy, all of the
customers who trusted me will be screwed, and my reputation will be ruined.”
Funny, asking that question never made me feel any better.

Then one day I asked myself a different question: “What would I do if we
went bankrupt?” The answer that I came up with surprised me: “I’d buy our
software, Opsware, which runs in Loudcloud, out of bankruptcy and start a
software company.” Opsware was the software that we’d written to automate all
the tasks of running the cloud: provisioning servers and networking equipment,
deploying applications, recovering the environment in case of disaster, and so
forth. Then I asked myself another question: “Is there a way to do that without
going bankrupt?”

I ran through different scenarios in my mind where we might move into the
software business and exit the cloud business. In each scenario, step one was
separating Opsware from Loudcloud. Opsware had been written to run only in
Loudcloud and had many constraints that prevented it from being a product that
would work in any environment. I asked my cofounder and CTO Tim Howes
how long it would take to separate Opsware from Loudcloud. He said about nine
months, which would prove to be quite optimistic. I immediately assigned a
team of ten engineers to start the process in a project we called Oxide.

At this point, our business was still a cloud business, and I gave no indication
to the rest of the staff that I might have other ideas. Doing so would have
instantly doomed the only business we were in, as everyone would want to work
on the future and not the past. I said that Oxide was simply another product line.
This statement deeply worried two of my employees who had graduated from
Stanford Business School. They scheduled an appointment and presented me


with a slide deck detailing why my decision to start Oxide was quixotic,
misguided, and downright stupid. They argued that it would steal precious
resources from our core business while pursuing a product that would surely fail.
I let them present all forty-five slides without my asking them a single question.
When they finished I said, “Did I ask for this presentation?” Those were the first
words I spoke as I made the transition from a peacetime CEO to a wartime CEO.

By virtue of my position and the fact that we were a public company, nobody
besides me had the complete picture. I knew we were in deep, deep trouble.
Nobody besides me could get us out of the trouble, and I was through listening
to advice about what we should do from people who did not understand all the
pieces. I wanted all the data and information I could get, but I didn’t need any
recommendations about the future direction of the company. This was wartime.
The company would live or die by the quality of my decisions, and there was no
way to hedge or soften the responsibility. If everybody I had hired—and who
gave their lives to the company—could be sent home with little to show for it,
then there were no excuses that would help. There would be no: “It was a
horrible economic environment”; “I got bad advice”; “Things changed so
quickly.” The only choices were survival or total destruction. Yes, most things
could still be delegated and most managers would be empowered to make
decisions in their areas of expertise, but the fundamental question of whether—
and _how_ —Loudcloud could survive was mine and mine alone to answer.


We muddled through the fourth quarter of 2001 and beat our target for the
year, delivering $57 million in revenue against our $55 million forecast. Not a
great win, but very few companies met expectations that year, so I took it as a
small victory. The stock price slowly rose to $4 a share, and it looked as though
we might be able to make the cloud business work.

In order to do so, we needed more cash. We carefully analyzed our financial
plan and decided that we needed another $50 million to get to cash flow
breakeven—the point at which we would no longer need to raise money. Given
our momentum in the market, raising money was now barely possible and the
only way to do it was in the form of a seldom-used construct called a private
investment in public equity (PIPE). We worked with Morgan Stanley to line up
investors with the goal of raising $50 million.

It was Monday morning, and we were all set to hit the road on Tuesday to
raise the PIPE when I got the call. “Ben, the CEO of Atriax is on the phone;
shall I put him through?” Atriax, an online foreign currency exchange backed by
Citibank and Deutsche Bank, was our largest customer. Atriax paid us more than


$1 million per month and had a two-year guaranteed contract. I was in the
middle of a meeting with Deb Casados, my vice president of human resources,
but I said, “Put him through.” He then informed me that Atriax was bankrupt and
could not pay any of the $25 million he owed us. It was like the world stopped
spinning. I sat there in a daze until I heard Deb’s voice saying, “Ben, Ben, Ben,
do you want to have this meeting later?” I said, “Yep.” I walked slowly over to
my CFO’s office to assess the damage. It was worse than I thought.

Given the materiality of losing the contract, we could not raise money without
first disclosing that we’d lost our largest customer and $25 million out of our
financial plan. We put the PIPE road show on hold and then issued a press
release. The stock immediately fell by 50 percent, and with a rapidly declining
market cap of $160 million, we could no longer raise $50 million in a PIPE. The
plan that was $50 million short of breakeven was now, with the loss of Atriax,
$75 million short of breakeven with no way to close the gap. Loudcloud was
doomed. I had to deploy Oxide _._

The situation was complex, because 440 of our 450 employees worked in the
cloud business, which represented all of our customers and generated 100
percent of our revenue. I could not tell the employees or even my executive team
that I was considering abandoning the cloud business, because our stock price
would have collapsed to nothing, killing any hope of selling the company and
avoiding bankruptcy.

The one person I needed and could trust was John O’Farrell. John ran business
and corporate development, but more than that he was the greatest big-deal
person I had ever known. To illustrate my point, let’s say you were a religious
man. We’re speaking in the hypothetical now. And let’s say you had reached
your end of days and you faced your maker for final judgment. Let’s further
suppose that as your fate was to be decided for all eternity, you were granted a
single person to negotiate on your behalf. Whom would you choose? Well, if it
were me, I’d take that Irish brother, John O’Farrell.

I told John that he and I needed to execute a contingency plan, and we needed
to get started immediately. This would be a two-person project to start, and we
needed everyone else focused on the task at hand—reducing Loudcloud’s cash
burn. Next I called Bill Campbell to explain why I thought we needed to exit the
cloud business.


Bill understood what a crisis looked like since he’d been CEO of GO

Corporation in the early 1990s. Essentially GO had attempted to build an
iPhone-like device in 1992 and ended up being one of the largest venture capital


losses in history. I took Bill through my logic: The only way out of the cloud
business without going bankrupt was through higher sales, because even if we
laid off 100 percent of the employees, the infrastructure costs would still kill us
without a sharper sales ramp. I further explained that the dwindling cash balance
decreased customer confidence, which in turn hurt sales, which in turn caused
the cash balance to decline further. He simply said “spiral.” And I knew that he
understood.


John and I mapped out the ecosystem to figure out which companies might be
interested in acquiring the Loudcloud business. Unfortunately, many of the
prospective buyers were in dire straits themselves. Giant telecoms Qwest and
WorldCom were embroiled in accounting fraud cases, and Exodus had already
gone bankrupt. We decided to focus on the three most likely buyers: IBM, Cable
& Wireless, and EDS.

IBM’s hosting business, led by the congenial Jim Corgel, immediately took a
strong interest. Jim valued the Loudcloud brand and our reputation for
technological superiority. EDS, on the other hand, showed no interest. This
worried me intensely as I studied all the public filings from both companies; it
was clear to me that EDS needed Loudcloud far more than IBM did. Needs

always trump wants in mergers and acquisitions. John said to me, “Ben, I think
we need to walk away from EDS, so that we can focus on the higher-probability
targets.” I asked him to draw the EDS organizational chart one more time to see
if we could find someone influential at EDS whom we hadn’t yet approached.
When he did, I asked, “Who is Jeff Kelly?” John paused, then said, “You know,
we haven’t gotten to Jeff, but he may be able to make this decision.”

Sure enough, Jeff was interested. Now with two potential bidders, we put
things in motion. John and I worked hard to create urgency with both IBM and
EDS, because time was against us. We hosted both companies in our facilities,
sometimes with them passing each other in the hallway as part of John’s wellorchestrated sales technique. The final step was to set the timeline for the
endgame. John and I debated the best way to do this as the deadlines that we
planned to set were clearly artificial. I suggested that we stop by Los Angeles on
our way to Plano, Texas, home of EDS, to get some advice from Michael Ovitz.

Michael was on Loudcloud’s board, but more important, he had formerly been
known by many observers as the Most Powerful Man in Hollywood. When he
was twenty-eight years old, he started a talent agency, Creative Artists Agency
(CAA), which grew to dominate the entertainment industry. CAA’s rise made
Michael so influential that he could routinely structure deals that had never been


done before.


When we arrived in his offices, the place buzzed with activity. Michael
seemed to be engaged in a dozen different activities, but finally came out to meet
with John and me. We explained the situation: We were racing against time and
had two bidders, but no specific incentive to coax them toward the end of the
process. Michael paused, thought for a moment, and then delivered his advice:

“Gentlemen, I’ve done many deals in my lifetime and through that process,
I’ve developed a methodology, a way of doing things, a philosophy if you will.
Within that philosophy, I have certain beliefs. I believe in artificial deadlines. I
believe in playing one against the other. I believe in doing everything and
anything short of illegal or immoral to get the damned deal done.”

Michael had a way of making things extremely clear.
We thanked him and headed to the airport. We called both EDS and IBM to
let them know that we would complete the process over the next eight weeks and
sell the Loudcloud business to someone. If they wanted to play, they had to
move on that schedule or withdraw immediately. The Michael Ovitz artificial
deadline was in full effect. We knew that we might have to go past it, but
Michael gave us confidence that going past the deadline was a better move than
not having one.

After seven weeks, we came to an agreement with EDS. They would buy
Loudcloud for $63.5 million in cash and assume its associated liabilities and
cash burn. We would retain the intellectual property, Opsware, and become a
software company. EDS would then license our software to run both Loudcloud
and the larger EDS for $20 million per year. I thought it was a great deal for both
EDS and us. It was certainly far better than bankruptcy. I felt 150 pounds lighter.
I could take a deep breath for the first time in eighteen months. Still, it wouldn’t
be easy. Selling Loudcloud meant selling about 150 employees to EDS and
laying off another 140.

I called Bill Campbell to tell him the good news: The deal was signed and we
would be announcing it in New York on Monday. He replied, “Too bad you
can’t go to New York and be part of the announcement; you’ll have to send
Marc.” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “You need to stay home and make
sure everybody knows where they stand. You can’t wait a day. In fact, you can’t
wait a minute. They need to know whether they are working for you, EDS, or
looking for a fucking job.” Damn. He was right. I sent Marc to New York and
prepared to let people know where they stood. That small piece of advice from
Bill proved to be the foundation we needed to rebuild the company. If we hadn’t


treated the people who were leaving fairly, the people who stayed would never
have trusted me again. Only a CEO who had been through some awful, horrible,
devastating circumstances would know to give that advice at that time.


**— CHAPTER 3 —**

## **THIS TIME WITH FEELING**


“I move onward, the only direction


Can’t be scared to fail in search of perfection.”


**—JAY Z, “ON TO THE NEXT ONE”**

# O nce the EDS sale was completed, I felt like the company was in good shape,

but my shareholders did not agree. I had sold all of my customers, all of my
revenue, and the business they understood. Every large shareholder bailed out,
and the stock price fell to $0.35 per share, which represented about half of the
cash we had in the bank. I realized that nobody besides me knew how bad things
had become and nobody besides me believed in the future, so I decided to take
the employees off-site and resell them on the opportunity.

I rented forty rooms in a low-end motel in Santa Cruz and took our remaining
eighty employees there for one night of drinking and one day of explaining the
Opsware opportunity. At the end of the day, I tried to be as honest as humanly
possible.

“You have now heard everything that I know and think about the opportunity
in front of us. Wall Street does not believe Opsware is a good idea, but I do. I
can understand if you don’t. Since this is a brand-new company and a brand-new
challenge, I am issuing everyone new stock grants today. All that I ask is that if
you have decided to quit that you quit today. I won’t walk you out the door—I’ll
help you find a job. But, we need to know where we stand. We need to know
who is with us and whom we can count on. We cannot afford to slowly bleed
out. You owe it to your teammates to be honest. Let us know where you stand.”

That day two employees quit. Of the other seventy-eight, all but two stayed
through the sale to Hewlett-Packard five years later.

After the off-site gathering, the first thing I had to do was increase the stock
price. The NASDAQ had sent me a curt letter stating that if we failed to get our


stock price over a dollar, they would “delist” us from the exchange and send us
to the purgatory known as penny stocks. The board debated the best way to do
this—reverse-split the stock, a stock buyback, or other options—but I felt we
just needed to tell our story. The story was simple. We had a great team, $60
million in the bank, a $20 million a year contract with EDS, and some serious
intellectual property. Unless I was the worst CEO of all time, we should be
worth more than $30 million. The story took hold, and the stock climbed above
$1 a share.

Next, I had to ship a product. Opsware had been built to run Loudcloud and
Loudcloud only. It was not yet ready for the world. In fact, parts of the code
were hardwired to physical machines in our building. Beyond that, the user
interface was far from ready for prime time. The component that managed the
network was called the Jive and featured a purple pimp hat on the front page.
Project Oxide gave us a running start, but our engineers were nervous. They
brought me a long list of features that they felt we needed to complete prior to
entering the market. They pointed to competitors with more finished products.

As I listened to their lengthy objections, it became clear to me that the features
the engineers wanted to add all came from Loudcloud requirements. As painful
as it might be, I knew that we had to get into the broader market in order to
understand it well enough to build the right product. Paradoxically, the only way
to do that was to ship and try to sell the wrong product. We would fall on our
faces, but we would learn fast and do what was needed to survive.

Finally, I had to rebuild the executive team. I had a CFO who didn’t know
software accounting, a head of sales who had never sold software, and a head of
marketing who did not know our market. Every one of them was great at their
old jobs, but not qualified for their new jobs. It was miserable, but necessary, to
see them all go.

The strategy and the team came together, and the business started working.
We began signing customers at a consistent pace and our stock price rose from
its $0.35 low to more than $7 a share. It felt like we were finally out of the
woods.


Naturally I was wrong.

## **SIXTY DAYS TO LIVE**


A few quarters into Opsware, we received very bad news from our largest
customer, EDS. “Largest customer” really understates it; EDS accounted for 90
percent of our revenue. And they were not happy. Their Opsware deployment


had stalled out and not met its goals as they had run into multiple difficult
technical issues. EDS wanted to cancel the deployment, end the contract, and get
their money back. Giving EDS their money back would mean the end of
Opsware. Getting into a big dispute with a customer that accounted for all but 10
percent of our revenue would also mean the end of Opsware. We were doomed
again.

I called my top two lieutenants on the account in for a meeting.
Jason Rosenthal was the very first employee I had hired and the best manager
in the company. A Stanford graduate with an impeccable memory and a genius
mind for managing all the details of a complex project, Jason was in charge of
the EDS deployment.

Anthony Wright grew up in the tough part of Pittsburgh, the son of legendary
street fighter Joe Wright, and had earned a black belt in several martial arts
himself. Self-made, super-determined, and unwilling to fail, Anthony had an
uncanny ability to quickly gain deep insight into people’s character and
motivations—“able to charm dogs off a meat truck,” is how another guy on the
team described it. Anthony was the relationship manager for EDS.

I began with an assessment: What happened? It turned out, a lot of things.
EDS’s environment was insane and chaotic. They had inherited networks and
infrastructure from every customer they’d ever signed and from every era in
which they had signed them. They had data centers connected by 56-kilobit links
at a time when no other customer connected at speeds even twenty times that
slow. EDS ran versions of operating systems that were so old that they didn’t
support basic technologies like threads, which meant our software wouldn’t run
on them. And the people were not our people. We’d find them sleeping in the
data center at two o’clock in the afternoon; they were not motivated and
generally not very happy. Beyond that, our product was far from perfect and
every one of the many bugs and shortcomings was a reason to stop the
deployment.

I took a long pause, rubbed my head, and then began to give instructions. I
chose my words carefully:

“I appreciate the difficulties and more than that, I thank you deeply for the
effort. However, I do not think that I’ve made myself clear on the situation that
we’re in. This is not a scenario where an excuse will do. This is a must win. If

EDS drops us, we’re fucked and it’s over. The IPO, avoiding the Loudcloud
bankruptcy, all the layoffs and pain will have been for nothing—because we’re
dead. So, our only option is to win. We cannot lose this one.


“Jason, the whole company is at your command. Whatever you need, I will
make sure you get it. Anthony, Jason is going to work to deliver all the value
that EDS expects, but he will fail. He will fail to deliver one hundred percent of
expectations, so you are now in charge of finding out what they don’t expect, but
want. You are in charge of finding the exciting value. When you do, we will
deliver it.”


Jason and Anthony then headed to Plano, Texas, to meet with their
counterparts at EDS.

They didn’t know who was making decisions, but after a bunch of meetings
and dead ends, they found their way to the office of a person I will call Frank
Johnson (not his real name)—a big guy who grew up in the oil fields of
Oklahoma, graduated from West Point, and now was in charge of anyone who
touched any servers at EDS. Anthony and Jason touted the Opsware technology
and potential cost savings.

After listening for a bit, Frank pushed back his chair, stood up, and shouted,
“You fucking want to know what I think about Opsware? I think it’s the biggest
goddamn piece of shit! All I hear about all day is how much this product fucking
sucks. I’m going to do everything I can to get you guys thrown out of here.”

Frank revealed his plan to remove all of our software immediately, demanding
all funds to be returned. He was dead serious.


Anthony remained calm, looked him in the eye, and said, “Frank, I will do
exactly as you say. I’ve heard you loud and clear. This is a terrible moment for
you and for us. Allow me to use your phone, and I will call Ben Horowitz and
give him your instructions. But before I do, can I ask you one thing? If my
company made the commitment to fix these issues, how much time would you
give us to do that?”

He responded, “Sixty days.” Anthony told him the clock had just started
ticking and left his office immediately. It was good news: We had exactly sixty
days to fix all the problems and make the deployment work. If we did not, we
were done. We had sixty days to live.

An early lesson I learned in my career was that whenever a large organization
attempts to do anything, it always comes down to a single person who can delay
the entire project. An engineer might get stuck waiting for a decision or a
manager may think she doesn’t have authority to make a critical purchase. These
small, seemingly minor hesitations can cause fatal delays. I could not afford any
hesitation, so I scheduled a daily meeting with Anthony, Jason, and the team—
though they were now based in Plano. The purpose was to remove all


roadblocks. If anyone was stuck on anything for any reason, it could not last
more than twenty-four hours—the time between meetings.

Meanwhile, Anthony worked furiously to find the exciting value we could
offer EDS. We started with little things that did not change our fate, but revealed
important clues. We flew our main EDS executive, Frank, out to meet with our
top engineers and architects. In booking the trip, Anthony reported that Frank
requested the longest layover possible in the connecting airport. I thought that I
misheard him. “What, he wants a long layover?”

Anthony: “Yep.”
Ben: “Why would anybody want a long layover in an airport?”
Anthony: “Apparently, he likes to hang out in the airport bar between flights.”
Ben: “Why does he like to do that?”
Anthony: “I asked him the same question. Frank said: ‘Because I hate my job
and I hate my family.’ ”

Wow. I had no idea who I was dealing with until that point. Understanding
how differently Frank viewed the world than the people at Opsware helped
clarify my thoughts. Frank expected to get screwed by us. It’s what always
happened to him in his job and presumably in his personal life. We needed
something dramatic to break his psychology. We needed to be associated with
the airport bar, not with his job or his family.

At the same time, Jason marched the team through the deployment with
unrelenting precision. A month into the plan, the Southwest Airlines crew that
worked the San Jose–Dallas flight knew Jason and his team by name. They made
steady progress, but it wasn’t going to be enough. We would not get EDS fully
deployed in sixty days—so now we really needed Anthony to deliver exciting
value.


As I sat in my office hoping for a breakthrough, my cell phone rang. It was
Anthony.

Anthony: “Ben, I think I’ve got it.”
Ben: “Got what?”

Anthony: “The exciting value is Tangram.”
Ben: “What?”

Anthony: “Tangram. EDS uses a product from a company called Tangram that
inventories their hardware and software. Frank absolutely loves it, but the
purchasing guys are going to force him to switch to an equivalent Computer
Associates product, because it’s free as part of EDS’s settlement with CA. Frank
hates the CA product. Frank is getting screwed again.”


Ben: “So what can we do?”

Anthony: “If Tangram can come free with Opsware, then Frank will love us.”
Ben: “That sounds economically impossible. If we buy the licenses from
Tangram and give them to EDS, that will be a colossal expense. We’ll never be
able to describe it to Wall Street.”


Anthony: “You asked me what EDS really wanted. They really want
Tangram.”

Ben: “Got it.”

I had never heard of Tangram, so I quickly looked them up. They were a small
company in Cary, North Carolina, but they traded on the NASDAQ market. I
looked up their market capitalization. This couldn’t be right. Tangram Enterprise
Solutions, according to Yahoo Finance, was worth only $6 million. I had never
heard of a public company being that cheap.

I immediately called my head of business development, John O’Farrell, and
told him that I wanted to buy Tangram, and I needed the entire process to be
extremely quick—as in, I wanted the Tangram acquisition done before our sixtyday window with EDS closed.

Tangram was run by Norm Phelps, an interim CEO, which was a great sign
that they’d be willing to sell the company, because most boards would much
rather sell a company than roll the dice by hiring a new CEO. John got in touch
with Tangram and they were immediately interested, so we assembled a team to
conduct due diligence while we negotiated a merger agreement in parallel. At
the end of due diligence, I brought my team back together. They promptly and
unanimously agreed that buying Tangram would be a bad idea: The technology
would be difficult to integrate and not that valuable. The company was in North
Carolina. It was fifteen years old and the technology was old, too. The finance
team thought the acquisition was a money loser. I listened, and then I told them
all that I didn’t care about any of that. We were going to buy Tangram. The team
seemed shocked, but did not argue with me.

John and I negotiated a deal to buy Tangram for $10 million in cash and stock.
We signed the deal prior to the end of the sixty-day plan. I called Frank from
EDS to tell him that once the transaction closed, we would include all Tangram
software for free as part of his Opsware contract. Frank was ecstatic. Now that
we had solved Frank’s Tangram problem, he viewed the work that Jason’s team
completed in a totally different light. At the end of the sixty days, Frank gathered
our team and made the following speech:

“I’ve given the speech that I gave to you guys at the beginning of this process


to at least a dozen other vendors. They all promised things, but none ever
delivered. You guys really delivered and I am shocked. You are the best vendor
that I have and I am happy to be working with you.”

We’d done it. We saved the account and saved the company. What a relief!
But we still had the small matter of the company that we’d just purchased and its
fifty-seven employees. Some decisions were simple—we didn’t need nine out of
the ten salespeople, because they weren’t selling anything. Some were more
complex: Should we keep the North Carolina location? In the end, we decided to
keep it and locate customer support there. It turned out that when you accounted
for turnover rates and the cost of recruiting and training, Cary, North Carolina,
engineers were cheaper to hire than Bangalore, India, engineers. As the years
went by, Tangram proved to be a highly profitable acquisition—well beyond the
critical role it played in saving the EDS account.

During acquisition talks, both sides had agreed that Tangram’s CFO, John
Nelli, would not become part of Opsware. But during the time between signing
and close, John began to get severe headaches. His doctors discovered that he
had brain cancer. Because he would not be an Opsware employee and it was a
preexisting condition, he would not be eligible for health insurance under our
plan. The cost of the treatment without health insurance would likely bankrupt
his family. I asked my head of HR what it would cost to keep him on the payroll
long enough to qualify for COBRA and what COBRA would cost. It wasn’t
cheap—about $200,000. This was a significant amount of money for a company
in our situation. On top of that, we barely knew John and technically we didn’t
“owe” him anything. This wasn’t our problem. We were fighting for our lives.

We were fighting for our lives, but he was about to lose his. I decided to pay
for his health costs and find the money elsewhere in the budget. I never expected
to hear anything else about that decision, but fifteen months later I received a
handwritten letter from John’s wife letting me know that John had died. She
wrote that she was absolutely shocked that I would help a total stranger and his
family and that I had saved her from total despair. She went on for several
paragraphs saying that she didn’t know why I did it, but it enabled her to
continue living and she was eternally grateful.

I guess I did it because I knew what desperation felt like.

## **SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST**


Almost as soon as the EDS crisis was resolved, I got news that three new clients
we had expected to sign were now fading away. An excellent new competitor,


BladeLogic, had arisen and was beating us in key accounts. We lost several
deals to them and missed our quarterly numbers as a result. The stock price
dropped back down to $2.90.

Here we go again.
With a losing product, a dwindling stock price, and a tired team, I knew we
were in trouble. To make matters worse, Marc, who had been working
exclusively with me on Loudcloud and Opsware as “full-time chairman of the
board,” had decided to found another company, Ning. The success or failure of
Opsware was really up to the team and me at this point, but the timing sucked.
Not only was the company circling the drain, but our most visible spokesman
was going to work on something else. Damn. After all that we had been through,
how could I ask the team to charge up yet another impossible mountain? How
could I muster the strength to do it myself?

I felt like I had no more stories, no more speeches, and no more “rah-rah” in
me. I decided to level with the team and see what happened. I called an all
engineering meeting and gave the following speech:

“I have some bad news. We are getting our asses kicked by BladeLogic and
it’s a product problem. If this continues, I am going to have to sell the company
for cheap. There is no way for us to survive if we don’t have the winning
product. So, I am going to need every one of you to do something. I need you to
go home tonight and have a serious conversation with your wife, husband,
significant other, or whoever cares most about you and tell them, ‘Ben needs me
for the next six months.’ I need you to come in early and stay late. I will buy you
dinner, and I will stay here with you. Make no mistake, we have one bullet left
in the gun and we must hit the target.”

At the time, I felt horrible asking the team to make yet another big sacrifice.
Amazingly, I found out while writing this book that I probably should have felt
good about it. Here’s what Ted Crossman, one of my best engineers, said about
that time and the launch of the aptly named Darwin Project many years later:


_Of all the times I think of at Loudcloud and Opsware, the Darwin Project_
_was the most fun and the most hard. I worked seven days a week 8 a.m.–10_
_p.m. for six months straight. It was full on. Once a week I had a date night_
_with my wife where I gave her my undivided attention from 6 p.m. until_
_midnight. And the next day, even if it was Saturday, I’d be back in the office_
_at 8 a.m. and stay through dinner. I would come home between 10–11 p.m._
_Every night. And it wasn’t just me. It was everybody in the office._


_The technical things asked of us were great. We had to brainstorm how_
_to do things and translate those things into an actual product._

_It was hard, but fun. I don’t remember losing anyone during that time. It_
_was like, “Hey, we gotta get this done, or we will not be here, we’ll have to_
_get another job.” It was a tight-knit group of people. A lot of the really_
_junior people really stepped up. It was a great growing experience for them_
_to be thrown into the middle of the ocean and told, “Okay, swim.”_

_Six months later we suddenly started winning proofs of concepts we_
_hadn’t before. Ben did a great job, he’d give us feedback, and pat people on_
_the back when we were done._


Eight years later, when I read what Ted had written, I cried. I cried because I
didn’t know. I thought I did, but I really didn’t. I thought that I was asking too
much of everybody. I thought that after barely surviving Loudcloud, nobody was
ready for another do-or-die mission. I wish I knew then what I know now.

After the speech came the hard work of defining the product. The product plan
was weighed down with hundreds of requirements from our existing customers.
The product management team had an allergic reaction to prioritizing potentially
good features above features that might hypothetically beat BladeLogic. They
would say, “How can we walk away from requirements that we _know_ to be true
to pursue something that we _think_ will help?”

It turns out that is exactly what product strategy is all about—figuring out the
right product is the innovator’s job, not the customer’s job. The customer only
knows what she thinks she wants based on her experience with the current
product. The innovator can take into account everything that’s possible, but
often must go against what she _knows_ to be true. As a result, innovation requires
a combination of knowledge, skill, and courage. Sometimes only the founder has
the courage to ignore the data; we were running out of time, so I had to step in:

“I don’t care about any of the existing requirements; I need you to reinvent the
product and we need to win.” Nine months later, when we released our new
product we could now win any deal. Armed with the new product, Mark
Cranney, head of sales, went to war.

After assembling a top-end sales force, he completely revamped the sales
process and sent every salesperson through a rigorous and unforgiving training
program. He demanded mastery. Any slip-up in technique, skill, or knowledge
would be met with total intolerance from Mark.


We held a weekly forecast call where Mark reviewed every deal in front of the


entire 150 person sales force. On one such call, a salesperson described an
account that he’d forecast in detail: “I have buy-in from my champion, the vice
president that he reports to, and the head of purchasing. My champion assures
me that they’ll be able to complete the deal by the end of the fiscal quarter.”

Mark quickly replied, “Have you spoken to the vice president’s peer in the
networking group?”

Sales rep: “Um, no I haven’t.”
Mark: “Have you spoken to the vice president yourself?”
Sales rep: “No.”
Mark: “Okay, listen carefully. Here’s what I’d like you to do. First, reach up
to your face and take off your rose-colored glasses. Then get a Q-tip and clean
the wax out of your ears. Finally, take off your pink panties and call the fucking
vice president right now, because you do not have a deal.”

Mark was right. It turned out that we did not have a deal, as the vice
president’s peer in networking was blocking it. We eventually got a meeting
with him and won the deal. More important, Mark set the tone: Sloppiness
would not be tolerated.


Now that we’d improved our competitive position, we went on the offensive.
In my weekly staff meeting, I inserted an agenda item titled “What Are We Not
Doing?” Ordinarily in a staff meeting, you spend lots of time reviewing,
evaluating, and improving all of the things that you do: build products, sell
products, support customers, hire employees, and the like. Sometimes, however,
the things you’re not doing are the things you should actually be focused on.

In one such meeting, after asking the question, every person on my staff
agreed: “We are not automating the network.” Although the original version of
Opsware that we used in Loudcloud automated our network, the software was
not robust and, of course, featured the purple-pimp-hat user interface. As a
result, when we switched over to being a software company, we narrowed our
focus to server automation and never revisited the decision. This worked well for

the first several years of Opsware, but now we had an opportunity to bring back
our network automation product.

Unfortunately, the Jive was not a good code base and could not be turned into
a commercial product. My choices were: (a) start a new project or (b) buy one of
the four existing network automation companies. Early in my career as an
engineer, I’d learned that all decisions were objective until the first line of code
was written. After that, all decisions were emotional. In addition, I had John
O’Farrell, the industry’s greatest M&A negotiator, on my team so I decided to


investigate the other companies before sizing the internal effort.

Surprisingly, among the four existing network automation players, the
company that we thought had the best product architecture, Rendition Networks,
had the lowest revenues. This made some of our businesspeople skeptical of our
technical evaluation. However, if I’d learned anything it was that conventional
wisdom had nothing to do with the truth and the efficient market hypothesis was
deceptive. How else could one explain Opsware trading at half of the cash we
had in the bank when we had a $20 million a year contract and fifty of the
smartest engineers in the world? No, markets weren’t “efficient” at finding the
truth; they were just very efficient at converging on a conclusion—often the
wrong conclusion.

After confirming that acquiring would be superior to building, we negotiated a
deal to buy Rendition Networks for $33 million. Within three months of
completing the acquisition, John negotiated a deal with Cisco Systems—the
world’s largest networking company—to resell our product. The deal included
an agreement to prepay us $30 million for advanced licenses. As a result, the
Cisco deal alone paid more than 90 percent of the acquisition costs.

Note to self: It’s a good idea to ask, “What am I not doing?”

## **THE ULTIMATE DECISION**


As we fielded the broader product line, our momentum steadily grew. From the
ashes, we’d built a software business that approached a $150 million revenue run
rate. Along with our revenue, our stock price rose from its floor of $0.35 per
share as well as we traded between $6 per share and $8 per share, sometimes
trading at a market capitalization of more than $800 million.

Still, everything was not rosy. Every quarter was tough, and the competitive
and the technology landscapes changed rapidly. A technology called
virtualization was taking the market by storm and changing the way customers
thought about automating their environments. In fact, it looked to me like
virtualization might be the technological breakthrough that finally enabled the
cloud computing business model to work. Beyond that, being a public company
was still never going to get easy. At one point, a shareholder activist named
Rachel Hyman decided that my ego was out of control, and she demanded that
the board remove me and sell the company immediately. This was despite the
fact that we were trading at $7 per share, which was ten times the original price
of her shares.


Nonetheless, I was not looking for the exits. Whenever a potential acquirer


approached us, I would always reply, “We are not for sale.” It was a great
answer in that I wasn’t ready to sell and it conveyed that, but it also left the door
open to a particularly aggressive buyer. “Not for sale” didn’t mean that we
wouldn’t listen to offers—it just meant that we weren’t trying to sell the
company. So, when EMC implied that it wanted to buy us, I thought nothing of
it. We were trading at about $6.50 per share and I wasn’t planning to sell at
anything close to that price. But this time the news of the offer leaked to the
press and the stock shot up to $9.50 per share, changing the economic equation,
especially since the stock was going up for all the wrong reasons.

Ironically, the higher the stock price went up, the more companies wanted to
buy us. Over the course of the next month, eleven companies expressed interest.
Given the uncertainty in the business and the implied earnings multiple, their
interest was too much to ignore.

To get things started, John and I called Michael Ovitz to get some advice. We
felt one of the potential bidders, Oracle, would be the least likely to bid high,
because it was extremely disciplined in its financial analysis. We conveyed this
to Michael and questioned whether we should pursue Oracle at all. His reply was
priceless: “Well, boys, if you are going to have a dog race, then you are going to
need a rabbit. And Oracle will be one hell of a rabbit.”

With that strategy in hand, we generated a broad set of bids, all between $10
and $11 per share, with the highest bids representing a 38 percent premium over
the current stock price. Although this was considered a good premium, I did not
feel right selling the company for $11 per share. The team had worked too hard,
we’d accomplished too much, and we were too good a company. The risks of
staying stand-alone were substantial, but I still wanted to bet on the team. I
recommended to the board that we not sell.


The board was surprised, but supportive. Still, they had a fiduciary
responsibility to shareholders to ask the tough questions. “If you’re unwilling to
sell at eleven dollars per share, is there a price at which you would sell?” I had to
think about that one. I had promised the team that if we got to be the number-one
company in a big market, we would not sell. We were number one, but how big
was the market? Did the team really want to continue or was it just me who
wanted to continue? How could I know without panicking the company? And
thus began a series of very long talks with myself.

It was an argument to the death, and it was me against me. On the one hand, I
argued that virtualization created an explosion of virtual server instances,
making what we did more essential than ever. In the next breath, I retorted that


while that may have been true, the architectural changes would make our market
position vulnerable. I battled myself for weeks before concluding that things
were changing fast enough that we’d need to make major changes to our product
architecture in order to stay on top. The key to answering the ultimate question
was knowing the state of the team. Were they up for yet another giant challenge
or were they at the end of a very long road? I decided to bring my direct reports
into the loop and ask them what they thought. The answers came back clear:
Everyone, with the exception of one person who felt that the opportunity in front
of us was still quite large, opted for the sale. Now it was just a matter of price.
But what price?

After a long discussion with John O’Farrell, I decided that the right price to
sell the company would be $14 per share, or about $1.6 billion. I took that
number back to the board. They thought the number was extremely high and that
it was unlikely we’d be able to generate a bid at that level, but they were
supportive nonetheless. I called back all the potential acquirers and let them
know that we would only entertain bids of $14 or more. There were no takers.

More than a month passed without a word, and I figured the M&A talks had
ended. I began refocusing on how to make the necessary changes to keep us
competitive. And then I received a call from Bob Beauchamp, the CEO of BMC
Software. He offered $13.25 per share. I held firm: “Bob, that’s great, but the
number is fourteen dollars per share.” Bob said that he’d have to think about it.
He called back two days later and offered $14 per share. Wow. The dog had
caught the bus.

John and I immediately called back all the other suitors to let them know that
we had an offer that we planned to take. Hewlett-Packard was still interested and
offered $13.50 per share in an effort to make sure that I wasn’t bluffing. I
responded that as a public company CEO, I couldn’t take a lower offer. HP
eventually offered $14.25 or $1.65 billion in cash. We had a deal.

When it finally ended—the long road from Loudcloud to Opsware—I couldn’t
believe that I’d sold what it took eight years and all of my life force to build.
How could I have done that? I was sick. I couldn’t sleep, I had cold sweats, I
threw up, and I cried. And then I realized that it was the smartest thing that I’d
ever done in my career. We’d built something from nothing, saw it go back to
nothing again, and then rebuilt it into a $1.65 billion franchise.

At that point, it felt like my business life was kind of over. I had hired all the
best people that I knew or could find, and I had gone through every step from
founding to going public to sale. I definitely did not feel like doing any of that


again. But I had learned so much. It seemed like such a waste to do something
completely different. And then I got an idea to build a new kind of venture
capital firm.

We will explore this idea in chapter 9, but first, chapters 4 through 8 will take
you through most everything I learned to this point plus a few new war stories
from my experiences running Loudcloud and Opsware.


**— CHAPTER 4 —**

## **WHEN THINGS FALL APART**


“There are several different frameworks one could use to get a handle on
the indeterminate vs. determinate question. The math version is calculus vs.
statistics. In a determinate world, calculus dominates. You can calculate
specific things precisely and deterministically. When you send a rocket to
the moon, you have to calculate precisely where it is at all times. It’s not
like some iterative startup where you launch the rocket and figure things out
step by step. Do you make it to the moon? To Jupiter? Do you just get lost
in space? There were lots of companies in the ’90s that had launch parties
but no landing parties.

“But the indeterminate future is somehow one in which probability and
statistics are the dominant modality for making sense of the world. Bell
curves and random walks define what the future is going to look like. The
standard pedagogical argument is that high schools should get rid of
calculus and replace it with statistics, which is really important and actually
useful. There has been a powerful shift toward the idea that statistical ways
of thinking are going to drive the future.”

# **—PETER THIEL** W hen I was attempting to sell the cloud computing services part of the

Loudcloud business, I met with Bill Campbell to update him on where I was
with the deal. The deal was critical, because without it, the company would
almost certainly go bankrupt.

After I carefully briefed him on where we were with both interested parties,
IBM and EDS, Bill paused for a moment. He looked me in the eyes and said,
“Ben, you need to do something in addition to working on this deal. You need to
do it alone with your general counsel. You need to prepare the company for


bankruptcy.” To an objective observer, this might sound like Bill was prudently
advising me to build my contingency plan. But something in his voice and his
eyes said something different. They said that he believed the contingency plan
was going to be _the_ plan.

The conversation brought to mind a story that a friend told me about his
brother, a young doctor. A thirty-five-year-old man came to see my friend’s
brother. The man looked awful. His eyes were hollow and his skin was ashen.
The young doctor knew something was wrong, but he could not figure out what,
so he brought in an elder colleague to help with the diagnosis. The more
experienced doctor examined the man and then sent him on his way. The old
doctor then turned to the young doctor and said, “He’s dead.” The young doctor
was flabbergasted: “What are you talking about? He just walked out of here
alive!” The older doctor replied, “He doesn’t know it yet, but he’s dead. He’s
had a heart attack and when people that young have heart attacks their bodies are
not yet pliable enough to recover. He won’t recover. He’s dead.” Three weeks
later the patient died.

I felt that Bill was telling me, although I was walking around trying to get the
deal done, that I was already dead and that I did not know it. It was a very hard
thing for him to say and only the best of friends will muster the courage to break
news that horrible. It was an even harder thing for me to hear. He told me so that
I could emotionally prepare myself and financially prepare the company for the
inevitable funeral. The odds of landing a company-saving deal during the
technology industry’s nuclear winter were close to nil. Chances were, I was
dead.


I never built that contingency plan. Through the seemingly impossible
Loudcloud series C and IPO processes, I learned one important lesson: Startup
CEOs should not play the odds. When you are building a company, you must
believe there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to your odds of finding
it. You just have to find it. It matters not whether your chances are nine in ten or
one in a thousand; your task is the same.

In the end, I did find the answer, we completed the deal with EDS, and the
company did not go bankrupt. I was not mad at Bill. To this day, I sincerely
appreciate his telling me the truth about the odds. But I don’t believe in statistics.
I believe in calculus.

## P eople always ask me, “What’s the secret to being a successful CEO?” Sadly,

there is no secret, but if there is one skill that stands out, it’s the ability to focus


and make the best move when there are no good moves. It’s the moments where
you feel most like hiding or dying that you can make the biggest difference as a
CEO. In the rest of this chapter, I offer some lessons on how to make it through
the struggle without quitting or throwing up too much.

While most management books focus on how to do things correctly, so you
don’t screw up, these lessons provide insight into what you must do after you
have screwed up. The good news is, I have plenty of experience at that and so
does every other CEO.

I put this section first even though it deals with some serious endgame issues
such as how to fire an executive and how to lay people off. In doing so, I follow
the first principle of the Bushido—the way of the warrior: keep death in mind at
all times. If a warrior keeps death in mind at all times and lives as though each
day might be his last, he will conduct himself properly in all his actions.
Similarly, if a CEO keeps the following lessons in mind, she will maintain the
proper focus when hiring, training, and building her culture.
