# **MANAGEMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE**

Everyone in the technology industry seems to agree that people are paramount,
yet nobody seems to be on the same page with what the people organization—
human resources—should look like.


The problem is that when it comes to HR, most CEOs don’t really know what
they want. In theory, they want a well-managed company with a great culture.
Instinctively they know that an HR organization probably can’t deliver that. As a
result, CEOs usually punt on the issue and implement something that’s
suboptimal, if not worthless.

Ironically one of the first things you learn when you run an engineering
organization is that a good quality assurance organization cannot build a highquality product, but it can tell you when the development team builds a low
quality product. Similarly, a high quality human resources organization cannot
make you a well-managed company with a great culture, but it can tell you when
you and your managers are not getting the job done.


**THE EMPLOYEE LIFE CYCLE**


The best way to approach management quality assurance is through the lens of
the employee life cycle. From hire to retire, how good is your company? Is your
management team world-class in all phases? How do you know?

A great HR organization will support, measure, and help improve your
management team. Some of the questions they will help you answer: **Recruiting**
**and Hiring**


Do you sharply understand the skills and talents required to succeed in
every open position?


Are your interviewers well prepared?


Do your managers and employees do an effective job of selling your
company to prospective employees?


Do interviewers arrive on time?


Do managers and recruiters follow up with candidates in a timely
fashion?


Do you compete effectively for talent against the best companies?


**Compensation**


Do your benefits make sense for your company demographics?


How do your salary and stock option packages compare with the
companies that you compete with for talent?


How well do your performance rankings correspond to your
compensation practices?


**Training and Integration**


When you hire an employee, how long does it take them to become
productive from the perspective of the employee, her peers, and her
manager?


Shortly after joining, how well does an employee understand what’s
expected of her?


**Performance Management**


Do your managers give consistent, clear feedback to their employees?


What is the quality of your company’s written performance reviews?


Did all of your employees receive their reviews on time?


Do you effectively manage out poor performers?


**Motivation**


Are your employees excited to come to work?


Do your employees believe in the mission of the company?


Do they enjoy coming to work every day?


Do you have any employees who are actively disengaged?


Do your employees clearly understand what’s expected of them?


Do employees stay a long time or do they quit faster than normal?


Why do employees quit?


**REQUIREMENTS TO BE GREAT AT RUNNING HR**


What kind of person should you look for to comprehensively and continuously
understand the quality of your management team? Here are some key
requirements:


**World-class process design skills** Much like the head of quality
assurance, the head of HR must be a masterful process designer. One key to
accurately measuring critical management processes is excellent process
design and control.


**A true diplomat** Nobody likes a tattletale and there is no way for an HR
organization to be effective if the management team doesn’t implicitly trust
it. Managers must believe that HR is there to help them improve rather than
police them. Great HR leaders genuinely want to help the managers and
couldn’t care less about getting credit for identifying problems. They will
work directly with the managers to get quality up and only escalate to the
CEO when necessary. If an HR leader hoards knowledge, makes power
plays, or plays politics, he will be useless.


**Industry knowledge** Compensation, benefits, best recruiting practices,
_etc._ are all fast-moving targets. The head of HR must be deeply networked
in the industry and stay abreast of all the latest developments.


**Intellectual heft to be the CEO’s trusted adviser** None of the other

skills matter if the CEO does not fully back the head of HR in holding the
managers to a high quality standard. In order for this to happen, the CEO
must trust the HR leader’s thinking and judgment.


**Understanding things unspoken** When management quality starts to
break down in a company, nobody says anything about it, but superperceptive people can tell that the company is slipping. You need one of
those.

## **CONCERNING THE GOING CONCERN**


“This ain’t for no fuck niggas


If you a real nigga then fuck with me.”


**—TRINIDAD JAMES, “ALL GOLD EVERYTHING”**

# O ne day in a staff meeting in the Loudcloud/Opsware days, someone brought

up an issue that had been bothering him for some time. “This place is entirely
too profane. It’s making many of the employees uncomfortable.” Others chimed
in: “It makes the environment unprofessional. We need to put a stop to it.”
Although the complaints were abstract, they were clearly directed at me since I
was the biggest abuser of profanity in the company and perhaps in the industry.
In those days, I directed the team with such urgency that it was rare for me to say
more than a few sentences without an expletive injected somewhere.

Part of it was intentional. I only had so much time with each employee and it
was critically important that I be crystal clear in those moments. Nothing makes
things clear like a few choice curse words. “That is not the priority” is radically
weaker than “That is not the fucking priority.” When the CEO drops the Fbomb, it gets repeated. And that’s good if you want your message to spread
throughout the company. (On the other hand, it’s extremely bad if you don’t
want your employees talking like a bunch of gangsta rappers.) But part of it was
also unintentional. At this point, I could barely control myself. This was not an
easy company to run, and I’d developed CEO Tourette’s syndrome—the
profanity was involuntary.

Since the complaints seemed broad and deep, I had to take them seriously. I
thought hard about it that night and considered the following.


In the technology business, some employees would be comfortable with
profanity while others would not.


If we outlawed profanity, then some employees who used it would not
come to work for us or quit once they got there because we would seem
old-fashioned and prudish.


If we kept profanity, some people might leave.


My judgment was biased, because I was the main offender.


After much consideration, I realized that the best technology companies of the
day, Intel and Microsoft, were known to be highly profane places, so we’d be off
culture with them and the rest of the modern industry if we stopped profanity.
Obviously, that didn’t mean that we had to encourage it, but prohibiting it
seemed both unrealistic and counterproductive. Attracting the very best
engineers meant recruiting from highly profane environments. The choice was
between optimizing for top talent or clean culture. Easy decision.

I decided to keep the cursing, but I also needed to make a statement. People
had complained and had run this issue all the way up the organization, and they
deserved an explanation. Explaining things would be tricky, because profanity
did not work in all contexts. We certainly could not tolerate profanity used to
intimidate or sexually harass employees, so I needed to make the distinction
clear. Approving profanity only in certain contexts was a tricky message to craft.

That night I watched a disturbing movie from the late 1970s called _Short Eyes_,
which told the graphic story of a child molester who went to prison and
confronted the one clear prison ethic: Child molesters must die. One of the
characters in the movie was a young man referred to by the other inmates as
“Cupcakes.”

Hard to believe, but watching that movie, I found my solution.
The next day, I gave the following speech at the all-company meeting:
“It has come to my attention that many people are uncomfortable with the
amount of profanity that we use. Being the number-one abuser, these complaints
have caused me to reflect on my own behavior as well as the company as a
whole. As I see it, we have two choices: (a) we can ban profanity or (b) we can
accept profanity. Anything in between is very unlikely to work. ‘Minimal
profanity’ cannot be enforced. I’ve said before that we cannot win unless we
attract the very best people in the world. In the technology industry, almost
everybody comes from a culture that allows profanity. Therefore, banning
profanity will likely limit our talent pool more than accepting profanity. As a
result, we will allow profanity. However, this does not mean that you can use
profanity to intimidate, sexually harass people, or do other bad things. In this


way, profanity is no different from other language. For example, consider the
word ‘cupcakes.’ It’s fine for me to say to Shannon, ‘Those cupcakes you baked
look delicious.’ But it is not okay for me to say to Anthony, ‘Hey, Cupcakes,
you look mighty fine in them jeans.’ ”

And that was all I said about that.

After that day, I never heard another complaint about profanity and I don’t
think we lost anybody because of the policy. Sometimes an organization doesn’t
need a solution; it just needs clarity. Once I made it clear that cursing was okay
—so long as it wasn’t used to intimidate or harass—nobody had a problem with
it anymore. At least as far as I knew. Bottom line, the results of the policy were
good: a comfortable work environment, low attrition, and no complaining.
Sometimes the right policy is the one that the CEO can follow.

## A s a company grows, it will change. No matter how well you set your culture,

keep your spirit, or slow-roll your growth, your company won’t be the same
when it’s one thousand people as it was when it was ten people. But that doesn’t
mean that it can’t be a good company when it reaches 1,000, 10,000, or even
100,000 employees. It will just be different. Making it good at scale means
admitting that it must be different and embracing the changes that you’ll need to
make to keep things from falling apart. This chapter explains some of the
changes that you will need to make.


# **HOW TO MINIMIZE POLITICS IN YOUR** **COMPANY**

In all my years in business, I have yet to hear someone say, “I love corporate
politics.” On the other hand, I meet plenty of people who complain bitterly about
corporate politics—sometimes even in the companies they run. So, if nobody
loves politics, why all the politics?

Political behavior almost always starts with the CEO. Now you may be
thinking, “I hate politics, I’m not political, but my organization is very political.
I clearly didn’t cause this.” Sadly, you needn’t be political to create extreme
political behavior in your organization. In fact, it’s often the least political CEOs
who run the most ferociously political organizations. Apolitical CEOs frequently
—and accidentally—encourage intense political behavior.

What do I mean by politics? I mean people advancing their careers or agendas
by means other than merit and contribution. There may be other types of politics,
but politics of this form seem to be the ones that really bother people.


**HOW IT HAPPENS**


A CEO creates politics by encouraging and sometimes incentivizing political
behavior—often unintentionally. As a very simple example, let’s consider
executive compensation. When you are CEO, senior employees will come to you
from time to time and ask for an increase in compensation. They may suggest
that you are paying them far less than their current market value. They may even
have a competitive offer in hand. Faced with this confrontation, if the request is
reasonable, you might investigate the situation. You might even give the
employee a raise. This may sound innocent, but you have just created a strong
incentive for political behavior.

Specifically, you will be rewarding behavior that has nothing to do with
advancing your business. The employee will earn a raise by asking for one rather
than as a result of your rewarding them for outstanding performance. Why is this
bad? Let me count the ways:


**1.** The other ambitious members of your staff will immediately get the point
and agitate for raises as well. Word always gets out. Note that neither this
campaign nor the prior one need be correlated with actual performance.
You will now spend time dealing with the political issues rather than actual
performance issues. Importantly, if you have a competent board, you will
not be able to give them all out-of-cycle raises, so your company executive
raises will occur on a first-come, first-served basis.


**2.** The less aggressive (but perhaps more competent) members of your team
will be denied off-cycle raises simply by being apolitical.


**3.** The object lesson for your staff and the company will be that the squeaky
wheel gets the grease, and that the most politically astute employees get the
raises. Get ready for a whole lot of squeaky wheels.


Now let’s move on to a more complicated example. Your CFO comes to you
and says that he wants to continue developing as a manager. He says that he
would like to eventually become a COO and would like to know what skills he
must demonstrate in order to earn that position in your company. Being a
positive leader, you would like to encourage him to pursue his dream. You tell
him that you think that he’d be a fine COO someday and that he should work to
develop a few more skills. In addition, you tell him that he’ll need to be a strong
enough leader, such that other executives in the company will want to work for
him. A week later, one of your other executives comes to you in a panic. She
says that the CFO just asked her if she’d work for him. She says that he said you
are grooming him to be the COO and that’s his final step. Did that just happen?
Welcome to the big time.


**HOW TO MINIMIZE POLITICS**


Minimizing politics often feels totally unnatural. It’s counter to excellent
management practices such as being open-minded and encouraging employee
development.

The difference between managing executives and managing more junior
employees can be thought of as the difference between being in a fight with
someone with no training and being in a ring with a professional boxer. If you
are in a fight with a regular person, then you can do natural things and they
won’t get you into much trouble. For example, if you want to take a step
backward, you can pick your front foot up first. If you do this against a


professional boxer, you will get your block knocked off. Professional boxers
train for years to take advantage of small errors in technique. Lifting your front
foot first to take a step backward will take you slightly off balance for a split
second and that’s all your opponent will need.

Similarly, if you manage a junior employee and they ask you about their
career development, you can say what comes naturally and generally get away
with it. As we saw above, things change when you deal with highly ambitious,
seasoned professionals. In order to keep from getting knocked out by corporate
politics, you need to refine your technique.


**THE TECHNIQUE**


As I developed as a CEO, I found two key techniques to be useful in minimizing
politics.


**1.** Hire people with the right kind of ambition. The cases that I described
above might involve people who are ambitious but not necessarily
inherently political. All cases are not like this. The surest way to turn your
company into the political equivalent of the U.S. Senate is to hire people
with the wrong kind of ambition. As defined by Andy Grove, the right kind
of ambition is ambition for the company’s success with the executive’s own
success only coming as a by-product of the company’s victory. The wrong
kind of ambition is ambition for the executive’s personal success regardless
of the company’s outcome.


**2.** Build strict processes for potentially political issues and do not deviate.
Certain activities attract political behavior. These activities include:


Performance evaluation and compensation


Organizational design and territory


Promotions


Let’s examine each case and how you might build and execute a process that
insulates the company from bad behavior and politically motivated outcomes.

**Performance evaluation and compensation** Often companies defer putting
performance management and compensation processes in place. This doesn’t
mean that they don’t evaluate employees or give pay raises; it just means they do
so in an ad hoc manner that’s highly vulnerable to political machinations. By


conducting well-structured, regular performance and compensation reviews, you
will ensure that pay and stock increases are as fair as possible. This is especially
important for executive compensation, since doing so will also serve to minimize
politics. In the example above, the CEO should have had an airtight performance
and compensation policy and simply told the executive that his compensation
would be evaluated with everyone else’s. Ideally, the executive compensation
process should involve the board of directors. This will help ensure good
governance and make exceptions even more difficult.

**Organizational design and territory** If you manage ambitious people, from
time to time they will want to expand their scope of responsibility. In the
example above, the CFO wanted to become the COO. In other situations, the
head of marketing might want to run sales and marketing or the head of
engineering may want to run engineering and product management. When
someone raises an issue like this with you, you must be very careful about what
you say, because everything that you say can be turned into political cannon
fodder. Generally, it’s best to say nothing at all. At most, you might ask “why?”
but if you do so be sure not to react to the reasons. If you indicate what you are
thinking, that information will leak, rumors will spread, and you plant the seeds
for all kinds of unproductive discussions. You should evaluate your
organizational design on a regular basis and gather the information that you need
to decide without tipping people off to what you plan to do. Once you decide,
you should immediately execute the reorg: Don’t leave time for leaks and
lobbying.

**Promotions** Every time your company gives someone a promotion, everyone
else at that person’s organizational level evaluates the promotion and judges
whether merit or political favors yielded it. If the latter, then the other employees
generally react in one of three ways:


**1.** They sulk and feel undervalued.


**2.** They outwardly disagree, campaign against the person, and undermine
them in their new position.


**3.** They attempt to copy the political behavior that generated the
unwarranted promotion.


Clearly, you don’t want any of these behaviors in your company. Therefore,
you must have a formal, visible, defensible promotion process that governs
every employee promotion. Often this process must be different for people on


your own staff. (The general process may involve various managers who are
familiar with the employee’s work; the executive process should include the
board of directors.) The purpose of the process is twofold. First, it will give the
organization confidence that the company at least attempted to base the
promotion on merit. Second, the process will produce the information necessary
for your team to explain the promotion decisions you made.

**Be careful with “he said, she said”** Once your organization grows to a
significant size, members of your team will from time to time complain about
each other. Sometimes this criticism will be extremely aggressive. Be careful
about how you listen and the message that it sends. Simply by hearing them out
without defending the employee in question, you will send the message that you
agree. If people in the company think that you agree that one of your executives
is less than stellar, that information will spread quickly and without
qualification. As a result, people will stop listening to the executive in question
and the executive will soon become ineffective.


There are two distinct types of complaints that you will receive:


**1.** Complaints about an executive’s behavior


**2.** Complaints about an executive’s competency or performance


Generally, the best way to handle the first type of complaint is to get the
complaining executive and the targeted executive in the room together and have
them explain themselves. Usually, simply having this meeting will resolve the
conflict and correct the behavior and improve the relationship (if it was actually
broken). Do not attempt to address behavioral issues without both executives in
the room. Doing so will invite manipulation and politics.

Complaints of the second type are both more rare and more complex. If one of
your executives summons the courage to complain about the competency of one
of their peers, then there is a good chance that either the complainer or the
targeted executive has a major problem. If you receive this type of complaint,
you will generally have one of two reactions: they will be telling you something
that you already know, or they’ll be telling you shocking news.

If they are telling you something that you already know, then the big news is
that you have let the situation go too far. Whatever your reasons for attempting
to rehabilitate the wayward executive, you have taken too long and now your
organization has turned on them. You must resolve the situation quickly. Almost
always, this means firing the executive. While I’ve seen executives improve


their performance and skill sets, I’ve never seen one lose the support of the
organization and then regain it.

On the other hand, if the complaint is new news, then you must immediately
stop the conversation and make clear to the complaining executive that you in no
way agree with their assessment. You do not want to cripple the other executive
before you reevaluate his performance. You do not want the complaint to
become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once you’ve shut down the conversation, you
must quickly reassess the employee in question. If you find he is doing an
excellent job, you must figure out the complaining executive’s motivations and
resolve them. Do not let an accusation of this magnitude fester. If you find that
the employee is doing a poor job, there will be time to go back and get the
complaining employee’s input, but you should be on a track to remove the poor
performer at that point.

As CEO, you must consider the systemic incentives that result from your
words and actions. While it may feel good in the moment to be open, responsive,
and action oriented, be careful not to encourage all the wrong things.
