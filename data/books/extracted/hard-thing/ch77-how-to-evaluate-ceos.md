# **HOW TO EVALUATE CEOs**

No position in a company is more important than the CEO and, as a result, no
job gets more scrutiny. The job is so poorly defined that you can end up doing
all kinds of nutty things (especially if you listen to some people who say things
like “the CEO should be the number-one salesperson”).

Sadly, little of this analysis that’s been done benefits CEOs, since most of the
discussions happen behind their backs. Here I want to take a step in the opposite
direction. By describing how I evaluate CEOs, I am at the same time describing
what I think the job of the CEO is. Here are the key questions we ask:


**1.** Does the CEO know what to do?


**2.** Can the CEO get the company to do what she knows?


**3.** Did the CEO achieve the desired results against an appropriate set of
objectives?


**1. DOES THE CEO KNOW WHAT TO DO?**


One should interpret this question as broadly as possible. Does the CEO know
what to do in all matters all the time? This includes matters of personnel,
financing, product strategy, goal sizing, and marketing. At a macro level, does
the CEO set the right strategy for the company and know its implications in
every detail of the company?

I evaluate two distinct facets of knowing what to do:


**Strategy** In good companies, the _story_ and the _strategy_ are the same
thing. As a result, the proper output of all the strategic work is _the story_ .


**Decision making** At the detailed level, the output of _knowing what to do_
is _the speed and quality of the CEO’s_ _decisions_ .


**The strategy and the story**


The CEO must set the context within which every employee operates.
The context gives meaning to the specific work that people do, aligns interests,
enables decision making, and provides motivation. Well-structured goals and
objectives contribute to the context, but they do not provide the whole story.
More to the point, they are not _the story_ . The story of the company goes beyond
quarterly or annual goals and gets to the hard-core question of _why_ . _Why_ should I
join this company? _Why_ should I be excited to work here? _Why_ should I buy its
product? _Why_ should I invest in the company? _Why_ is the world better off as a
result of this company’s existence?

When a company clearly articulates its story, the context for everyone—
employees, partners, customers, investors, and the press—becomes clear. When
a company fails to tell its story, you hear phrases like


These reporters don’t get it.


Who is responsible for the strategy in this company?


We have great technology, but need marketing help.


The CEO doesn’t have to be the creator of the vision. Nor does she have to be

the creator of the story. But she must be the keeper of the vision and the story.
As such, the CEO ensures that the company story is clear and compelling.

The story is not the mission statement; the story does not have to be succinct.
It is the story. Companies can take as long as they need to tell it, but they must
tell it and it must be compelling. A company without a story is usually a
company without a strategy.

Want to see a great company story? Read Jeff Bezos’s three-page letter he
wrote to shareholders in 1997. In telling Amazon’s story in this extended form—
not as a mission statement, not as a tagline—Jeff got all the people who mattered
on the same page as to what Amazon was about.


**Decision making**


Some employees make products, some make sales; the CEO makes
decisions. Therefore, a CEO can most accurately be measured by the speed and
quality of those decisions. Great decisions come from CEOs who display an
elite mixture of intelligence, logic, and courage.

As already noted, courage is particularly important, because every decision
that a CEO makes is based on incomplete information. At the time of any given
decision, the CEO will generally have less than 10 percent of the information
typically present in the post hoc Harvard Business School case study. As a
result, the CEO must have the courage to bet the company on a direction even
though she does not know if the direction is right. The most difficult decisions
(and often the most important) are difficult precisely because they will be deeply
unpopular with the CEO’s most important constituencies (employees, investors,
and customers).

The best decision that I made in my career—to sell the Loudcloud business to
EDS and become Opsware—would have lost by a landslide had I put it to a vote
with my employees, my investors, or my customers.

As CEO, there is never enough time to gather all information needed to make
a decision. You must make hundreds of decisions big and small in the course of
a typical week. You cannot simply stop all other activities to gather
comprehensive data and do exhaustive analysis to make that single decision.
Knowing this, you must continuously and systematically gather knowledge in
the company’s day-to-day activities so that you will have as much information as
possible when the decision point arrives.

In order to prepare to make any decision, you must systematically acquire the
knowledge of everything that might impact any decision that you might make.
Questions such as:


What are the competitors likely to do?


What’s possible technically and in what time frame?


What are the true capabilities of the organization and how can you
maximize them?


How much financial risk does this imply?


What will the issues be, given your current product architecture?


Will the employees be energized or despondent about this promotion?


Great CEOs build exceptional strategies for gathering the required
information continuously. They embed their quest for intelligence into all of
their daily actions from staff meetings to customer meetings to one-onones. Winning strategies are built on comprehensive knowledge gathered in
every interaction the CEO has with an employee, a customer, a partner, or an
investor.


**2. CAN THE CEO GET THE COMPANY TO DO WHAT SHE**


**KNOWS?**


If the CEO paints a compelling vision and makes fast, high-quality decisions,
can she then get the company to execute her vision? The first ingredient in being
able to do this is leadership, as I outlined in the section “Follow the Leader.”

In addition, executing well requires a broad set of operational skills. The
larger the organization, the more elaborate the requisite skill set.

In order for a company to execute a broad set of decisions and initiatives, it

must:


**Have the capacity to do so.** In other words, the company must contain
the necessary talent in the right positions to execute the strategy.


**Be a place where every employee can get things accomplished.** The
employees must be motivated, communication must be strong, the amount
of common knowledge must be vast, and the context must be clear.


**Is the CEO building a world-class team?**


The CEO is responsible for the executive team plus the fundamental interview
and hiring processes for all employees. She must make sure the company
sources the best candidates and the screening processes yield the candidates with
the right combination of talent and skills. Ensuring the quality of the team is a
core part of running the company. Great CEOs constantly assess whether they
are building the best team.

The output of this capability is the quality of the team. It’s important to note
that team quality is tightly tied to the specific needs of the company in the
challenges it faces at the point in time it faces them. As a result, it’s quite
possible that the executive team changes several times, but the team is high


quality the entire way and there is no attrition problem.


**Is it easy for employees to contribute to the mission?**


The second part of the evaluation determines whether the CEO can effectively
run the company. To test this, I like to ask this question: “How easy is it for any
given individual contributor to get her job done?”

In well-run organizations, people can focus on their work (as opposed to
politics and bureaucratic procedures) and have confidence that if they get their
work done, good things will happen both for the company and for them
personally. By contrast, in a poorly run organization, people spend much of their
time fighting organizational boundaries and broken processes.

While it may be quite easy to describe, building a well-run organization
requires a high level of skill. The skills required range from organizational
design to performance management. They involve the incentive structure and the
communication architecture that drive and enable every individual employee.
When a CEO “fails to scale,” it’s usually along this dimension. In practice, very
few CEOs get an A on this particular test.

Netflix’s CEO, Reed Hastings, put great effort into designing a system that
enables employees to be maximally effective. His presentation of this design is
called Reference Guide on Our Freedom and Responsibility Culture. It walks
through what Netflix values in their employees, how they screen for those values
during the interview process, how they reinforce those values, and how they
scale this system as the number of employees grows.


**3. DID THE CEO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS AGAINST**


**AN APPROPRIATE SET OF OBJECTIVES?**


When measuring results against objectives, start by making sure the objectives
are correct. CEOs who excel at board management can “succeed” by setting
objectives artificially low. Great CEOs who fail to pay attention to board
management can “fail” by setting objectives too high. Early in a company’s
development, objectives can be particularly misleading since nobody really
knows the true size of the opportunity. Therefore, the first task in accurately
measuring results is setting objectives correctly.

I also try to keep in mind that the size and nature of the opportunity varies
quite a bit across companies. Hoping that a hardware company can be as capitallight as a consumer Internet company or trying to get Yelp to grow as fast


as Twitter doesn’t make sense and can be quite destructive. CEOs should be
evaluated against their company’s opportunity—not somebody else’s company.
Let me share a funny story that illustrates a CEO really owning delivering
against results. This story is from Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China’s biggest
search engine company. In a lecture he gave at Stanford University in 2009,
Robin recalls that on the day of Baidu’s IPO—usually one of
an entrepreneur’s most exhilarating days in his entire life—he sat at his desk
terrified. Why? Listen to how Robin owned delivering results:


_In 2004, we raised our last round of VC money led by Draper Fisher_
_Jurvetson . . . and Google, one of our great colleagues. Then a year later,_
_in 2005, the company went public. The ideal price was $27 [the stock’s_
_initial offer price] and it closed on the first day at $122. It was great for_
_many of the Baidu employees and for all of the Baidu investors. It was a_
_very miserable thing for me because when I decided to take the company_
_public, I was only prepared to deliver financial results that match the price_
_of $27 or maybe a little higher, $30, $40. But I was really shocked to see_
_that the price went to $122 on the first day. So that meant I needed to_
_deliver real results that matched an expectation much, much higher than_
_what I had prepared to do. But in any case, I thought I had no choice. So I_
_put my head down and focused on operations, focused on technology,_
_focused on the user’s experience, and I delivered._


Once we’ve taken all of this into account, we see that the results against
objectives or “black box” results are a _lagging_ indicator. And as they say in the
mutual fund prospectuses, “past performance is no guarantee of future results.”
The white-box CEO evaluation criteria—“Does the CEO know what to do?” and

“Can the CEO get the company to do it?”—will do a much better job of
predicting the future.


**CLOSING THOUGHT**


CEO evaluation need not be a byzantine, unarticulated art. All people, including
CEOs, will perform better on a test if they know the questions ahead of time.

**—KANYE WEST, “STRONGER”**

# W hen we were in the process of selling Opsware, HP’s initial bid came in at

$14 per share. BMC countered with $14.05. Then HP countered them with
$14.25. John O’Farrell and I planned our strategy for closing the bidding
process. We figured that if we executed correctly, the winning bid would come
in at $15 per share or higher. Everybody was extremely excited.

Then disaster struck. Or more specifically, our auditor, Ernst & Young, nearly
destroyed the deal.

During BMC’s diligence process, they discovered that we had accounted for
three deals differently than they had. Specifically, each of our three deals
contained something that had come to be known in the industry as the “CA
clause” in honor of the infamous software company Computer Associates, or CA
for short. The CA clause had come about as a result of some of CA’s business

practices. Apparently CA had tricked their customers by selling them
maintenance contracts that gave them rights to free upgrades forever for


products named “X.” CA would then change the name of product “X” to product
“Y” and charge their customers for an upgrade the customers thought they were
entitled to for free. It was very clever, and totally dirty. To fight back, savvy
customers started requiring all software vendors to include “the CA clause” in
their contracts. The clause stated that if you released a new version of your
software that contains all of the functionality of the previous version, plus some
new features and a new name, then that product (despite the new name) would
be covered under the existing contract with no additional fees due.

There were two possible ways to interpret the CA clause. You could either
interpret it as it was intended, as a workaround for CA’s bad behavior, or you
could interpret it as a promise of future functionality. If you interpreted it as the
former then you were required to recognize all the revenue up front. If you
interpreted it as the latter, then you would recognize the revenue ratably over the
course of the contract. In either case, cash payments would be the same.

We understood this ambiguity when we signed the three deals that contained
the clause, so we had our E&Y partner, Dave Price, audit the deals and then tell
us how we should account for them. Dave correctly understood the intent and
recommended that we take the revenue up front in all three deals. BMC’s E&Y
partner concluded the opposite and they accounted for similar deals ratably.
When alerted to the difference, the BMC partner escalated the issue to Ernst &
Young’s national office.

E&Y’s national audit partner called me to report that he now disagreed with
his partner’s audit and required that we restate revenue guidance in the next
forty-eight hours. I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. Restating revenue
would tank the stock price and destroy the pending sale. The accounting had no
material impact on cash flows and our treatment was based on the judgment of
Ernst & Young in the first place. If they had accounted for it the other way
initially, the stock price would be the same as it is now. It was the restatement
that would kill us.


What the hell?

I calmed down and replied carefully.
Ben: “The accounting is meant to reflect the intent of both us and our
customers in the contract, correct?”


E&Y: “Correct.”

Ben: “So, why don’t we call all three customers on the phone and ask them
their intent? If it’s what Dave Price reflected in our contracts, then we’ll leave
them as they are. If it’s something else, we’ll restate revenue.”


E&Y: “No. That’s not good enough. You’ll need to get all three customers to
amend their contracts to use new language that we’ve come up with at E&Y to
clear things up.”

Ben: “But all three customers are large banks. They have risk departments.
They won’t just amend their contracts quickly. To make things worse, we are in
the middle of a $1.6 billion transaction. You will wreck our deal.”

E&Y: “We don’t care. That’s what you have to do.”
Ben: “But we’ve been a customer for eight years, paid you millions of dollars
in fees, and your partner made this judgment to begin with. Why would you
destroy our transaction if we and the customers verbally agree with the current
interpretation?”

E&Y: “Either amend the contracts or restate your revenue. You have fortyeight hours.”

Dave Price looked like he was going to burst into tears.
E&Y’s national office did not care about the spirit of the law, only the letter.
They refused to do what was right from an accounting or business standpoint.
They were determined to do what was optimally convenient for Ernst & Young.

My CFO, Dave Conte, was pale as a ghost. Hundreds of people had worked
for eight years to get to this point and it looked like all that work would be
flushed down the toilet by the accounting firm that Dave handpicked. He had
worked at Ernst & Young for fifteen years before joining Opsware. Normally
gregarious and outgoing, he could barely speak. I was furious at everybody but I
knew that nothing that I could say would help the problem or make Dave feel
any worse than he already felt. I turned to Jordan Breslow, my general counsel,
and said, “Do we have to disclose this to the acquirers right away?”
Horrifyingly, he said, “Yes.”

We told HP and BMC about the discrepancy and that we thought we could
resolve the issue by amending the contracts in the next twenty-four hours.
Neither party believed us. I don’t know if I believed it. How could we possibly
get three large banks to amend their contracts in twenty-four hours? Both
potential buyers made plans to respond to the news and update their position and
possibly their bids.

In the meantime, Dave, Mark Cranney, and I went to work to get the contracts
amended. We sat in the finance conference room drawing lines between
everybody we knew in the world and tried to figure out how to get to the right
people in time to save the deal. I called every board member to see which bank
he kept his money in and whether he had any influence or knew somebody with


influence. Mark stayed on the phone with the sales reps and the people whom we
knew at the accounts. Jordan and Dave came up with ten different ways to word
the amendment. We stayed up all night working on the deal and the entire time,
Dave looked as though he was having a massive heart attack. Miraculously, by
11 a.m., we got all three contracts amended, and it was in less than twenty-four
hours. We would not have to restate revenue.


Not surprisingly, the entire thing spooked BMC, and they withdrew their bid.
They did not believe that the issue had been put to bed. HP wasn’t spooked, but
they lowered their offer to $13.75 per share due to the “taint” on the deal.

That night the board met in our offices to discuss the new offer from HP and
inform them that BMC had dropped out. The board was unanimous in its advice
that we should take the $13.75 offer. I disagreed. I said that I would not take a
nickel less than the $14.25 originally offered. Bill Campbell looked at me like I
was a general who had spent too much time in the field. At that point, I had not
slept and didn’t know if he was right or wrong. I just knew that I had waited all
night to be right and I couldn’t get much wronger.

I gathered myself and restated my position: “HP offered $14.25, a price that
equals sixteen times trailing twelve months revenue for one reason and one
reason only. They offered it because we are the premium company, the gold
standard if you will in an important market. That is the entire premise of this
deal. The second that we accept a discounted offer or in any other way suggest
that we are not the gold standard, this deal falls apart.” John O’Farrell nodded in
agreement. The board uneasily accepted my position.

I went back to HP and told them the deal would be $14.25 or nothing. After
about a two-hour pause, during which time the color never returned to Dave
Conte’s face, they accepted. We had a deal. A deal for about $100 million less
than if our so-called partner had not stabbed us in the back, but a deal
nonetheless. I still hate Ernst & Young.

## I am telling this story today because just when you think there are things you

can count on in business, you quickly find that the sky is purple. When this
happens, it usually does no good to keep arguing that the sky is blue. You just
have to get on and deal with the fact that it’s going to look like Barney for a
while.


# **SOLVING THE ACCOUNTABILITY VS.** **CREATIVITY PARADOX**

A software engineer identifies a weakness in your current product architecture
that will significantly impair its ability to scale down the road. She figures out
that she’ll have to slip the product schedule three months to fix it. Everybody
agrees that three months is an acceptable slip to correct the problem. The
schedule actually slips nine months, but she was right about the problem. Do you
reward her for her creativity and courage or hold her accountable for the slip?

If you become a prosecuting attorney and hold her to the letter of the law on
her commitments, you will almost certainly discourage her and everybody else
from taking important risks in the future. If you take this stance consistently,
don’t be surprised in the future if your people don’t have time to solve hard
problems because they will be far too busy covering their butts.

On the other hand, if you don’t hold her accountable for her commitment, then
the people who actually do the work to meet their commitments might feel like
idiots. Why did I stay up all night making the deadline if the CEO rewards the
person who missed her schedule by six months? If your hardest working, most
productive employees feel like chumps and you are looking for the culprit, look
in the mirror. You have failed to hold people accountable for their actions.
Welcome to the Accountability vs. Creativity Paradox.

As we look to solve it, let’s start with the most basic assumption. Do you
assume that your employees are by and large creative, intelligent, and
motivated? Or do you assume that they are lazy, conniving, and counting the
minutes to quitting time? If you believe the latter, then you might as well just
give up on creativity and innovation in your organization, because you will not
get it. It’s better to believe the former and assume that people have good
intentions unless they prove otherwise. Still, you must hold people accountable
to avoid the chump factor. How do you think about that?

Let’s look at accountability across the following dimensions: promises,
results, and effort.


**ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EFFORT**


This is the easy one. To be a world-class company, you need world-class effort.
If somebody isn’t giving it to you, they must be checked.


**ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PROMISES**


A lot of good-running organizations have statements like “make a commitment,
keep a commitment.” It’s true that if you sign up for something and you don’t do
it, you let everyone in the organization down. This type of letdown can be
contagious. Holding people accountable for their promises is a critical factor in
getting things done. This changes as the degree of difficulty in fulfilling the
promise increases. Promising to complete a piece of marketing collateral or send
an email is different from promising to meet an engineering schedule that
involves solving some fundamentally hard computer science problem. You must
hold people accountable for the former; the latter is more complicated and
relates to results.


**ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESULTS**


This is where things get complicated. If someone fails to deliver the result she
promised, as in the opening story, must you hold her accountable? Should you
hold her accountable? The answer is that it depends. It depends upon:


**Seniority of the employee** You should expect experienced people to be
able to forecast their results more accurately than junior people.


**Degree of difficulty** Some things are just plain hard. Making your sales
number when your product is inferior to the competition and a recession
hits midquarter is hard. Building a platform that automatically and
efficiently takes serial programs and parallelizes them, so that they can
scale out, is hard. It’s hard to make a good prediction and hard to meet that
prediction. When deciding the consequence of missing a result, you must
take into account the degree of difficulty.


**Amount of stupid risk** While you don’t want to punish people for taking
good risks, not all risks are good. While there is no reward without risk,
there is certainly risk with little or no chance of corresponding reward.
Drinking a bottle of Jack Daniel’s then getting behind the wheel of a car is


plenty risky, but there’s not much reward if you succeed. If someone
missed a result, did she take obviously stupid risks that she just neglected to
consider, or were they excellent risks that just did not pan out?


**REVISITING THE OPENING PROBLEM**


So looking back at the opening problem, here are some things to consider:


**1.** _How senior is she?_ If she’s your chief architect, you’ll need her to get
better at scoping her work or she’s going to trash the organization. If she is
more junior, this should be more a teaching moment than a scolding

moment.


**2.** _How hard was it?_ If it was a miracle that you ever made that piece of
crap scale, then you shouldn’t yell at her. In fact, you should thank her. If it
was a relatively trivial project that just took too long, then you need to
address that.


**3.** _Was the original risk the right one to take?_ Would the product really
have run out of scale in the short-to-medium term? If the answer is yes,
then whether it took three months or nine months, it was the right risk to
take and if faced with the same situation again, you probably should not
change any of your actions. You shouldn’t be wringing your hands about
that.


**FINAL POINT**


In the technology business, you rarely know everything up front. The difference
between being mediocre and magical is often the difference between letting
people take creative risk and holding them too tightly accountable.
Accountability is important, but it’s not the only thing that’s important.


# **THE FREAKY FRIDAY MANAGEMENT** **TECHNIQUE**

Many years ago, I encountered a particularly tricky management situation. Two
excellent teams in the company, Customer Support and Sales Engineering, went
to war with each other. The sales engineers escalated a series of blistering
complaints arguing that the Customer Support team did not respond with
urgency, refused to fix issues in the product, and generally inhibited sales and
customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, the Customer Support group claimed that the
sales engineers submitted bugs without qualification, did not listen to valid
suggested fixes, and were alarmists who assigned every issue the top priority.
Beyond the actual complaints, the teams genuinely did not like each other. To
make matters worse, these groups had to work together constantly in order for
the company to function. Both teams boasted superb personnel and outstanding
managers, so there was nobody to fire or demote. I could not figure out what to
do.


Around this time, I miraculously happened to watch the motion picture classic
_Freaky Friday_, starring the underrated Barbara Harris and the incomparable
Jodie Foster. (There is also a high-quality remake starring Jamie Lee Curtis and
the troubled but talented Lindsay Lohan.) In the film, mother and daughter grow
completely frustrated with each other’s lack of understanding and wish that they
could switch places and, through the magic of film, they do.

Through the course of the movie, by being inside each other’s bodies, both
characters develop an understanding of the challenges that the other faces. As a
result, the two become great friends when they switch back. After watching both
the original and the remake, I knew that I had found the answer: I would employ
a _Freaky Friday_ management technique.

The very next day I informed the head of Sales Engineering and the head of
Customer Support that they would be switching jobs. I explained that, like Jodie
Foster and Barbara Harris, they would keep their minds, but get new bodies.
Permanently. Their initial reactions were not unlike the remake where Lindsay
Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis both scream in horror.


However, after just one week walking in the other’s moccasins, both
executives quickly diagnosed the core issues causing the conflict. They then
swiftly acted to implement a simple set of processes that cleared up the combat
and got the teams working harmoniously. From that day to the day we sold the
company, the Sales Engineering and Customer Support organizations worked
better together than any other major groups in the company—all thanks to
_Freaky Friday_, perhaps the most insightful management training film ever made.
