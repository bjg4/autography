# **THE RIGHT KIND OF AMBITION**

When hiring a management team, most startups focus almost exclusively on IQ,
but a bunch of high-IQ people with the wrong kind of ambition won’t work. I
have already stressed that you should strive to hire people with the right kind of
ambition. As I’ve talked about these ideas in the last few years, I have received a
mixed response. Some think it’s good advice, while others question it.

At a macro level, a company will be most successful if the senior managers
optimize for the company’s success (think of this as a global optimization) as
opposed to their own personal success (local optimization). No matter how well
the CEO designs the personal incentive programs, they will never be perfect. In
addition, career incentives like promotions and territory ownership fall outside
the scope of bonus plans and other a priori management tools. In an equity-based
compensation structure, optimizing for the company’s success should yield
better results for individuals as well. As my Opsware head of sales Mark
Cranney used to say, “Two percent of zero is zero.”

It is particularly important that managers have the right kind of ambition,
because anything else will be exceptionally demotivating for their employees.
As an employee, why would I want to work long hours to advance the career of
my manager? If the manager cares more about his career than the company, then
that’s what I’d be doing. Nothing motivates a great employee more than a
mission that’s so important that it supersedes everyone’s personal ambition. As a
result, managers with the right kind of ambition tend to be radically more
valuable than those with the wrong kind. For a complete explanation of the
dangers of managers with the wrong kind of ambition, I strongly recommend Dr.
Seuss’s management masterpiece _Yertle the Turtle_ .


**SCREENING FOR THE RIGHT KIND OF AMBITION**


As with any complex character trait, there is no way to perfectly screen for the
right kind of ambition in an interview, but hopefully some of these thoughts will
prove useful.

At a macro level, everybody views the world through her own personal prism.


When interviewing candidates, it’s helpful to watch for small distinctions that
indicate whether they view the world through the “me” prism or the “team”
prism.

People who view the world through the “me” prism might describe a prior
company’s failure in an interview as follows: “My last job was my e-commerce
play. I felt that it was important to round out my résumé.” Note the use of _my_ to
personalize the company in a way that it’s unlikely that anyone else at the
company would agree with. In fact, the other employees in the company might
even be offended by this usage. People with the right kind of ambition would not
likely use the word _play_ to describe their effort to work as a team to build
something substantial. Finally, people who use the “me” prism find it natural and
obvious to speak in terms of “building out my résumé” while people who use the
“team” prism find such phrases to be somewhat uncomfortable and awkward,
because they clearly indicate an individual goal that is separate from the team
goal.

On the other hand, people who view the world purely through the team prism
will very seldom use the words _I_ or _me_ even when answering questions about
their accomplishments. Even in an interview, they will deflect credit to others on
their previous team. They will tend to be far more interested in how your
company will win than in how they will be compensated or what their career
path will be. When asked about a previously failed company, they will generally
feel such great responsibility that they will describe in detail their own
misjudgments and bad decisions.

When we hired the head of worldwide sales for Opsware, using this screen
proved to be quite valuable. Since this was a sales position, I should mention (in
reference to the commenter above) that ambition for the company above one’s
own goals is particularly important for the head of sales. The reasons are many:


The local incentives in sales are particularly strong and difficult to
balance without the right kind of leadership.


The sales organization is the face of the company to the outside world. If
that group optimizes for itself, your company will have a major problem.


In high-tech companies, fraud generally starts in sales due to managers
attempting to perfect the ultimate local optimization.


Throughout our interview process, we met with a lot of candidates who took
sole credit for landing extremely large deals, achieving impressive goals, and


generating company success. Invariably, the candidates who claimed the most
credit for deals would have the most difficult time describing the details of how
the deal was actually won and orchestrated. During reference checks, others
involved in the deals would tell a very different story.

When I spoke to Mark Cranney, on the other hand, it was difficult to get him
to discuss his personal accomplishments. In fact, some of the other interviewers
felt that Mark was standoffish and even obnoxious in the way he bristled at
certain questions. One interviewer complained, “Ben, I know that he increased
the size of the Nike deal from one million to five million, because our contact at
Nike told me that, but Mark wouldn’t go into any detail on it.” When I
interviewed Mark, he really only wanted to discuss how his old company won.
He went into great detail about how his team diagnosed weaknesses versus the
competition and how he worked with another executive to advance the product.
He then talked about how he worked with the CEO to revise the way the sales
force was trained and organized.

When the conversation turned to Opsware, Mark had already interviewed
sales reps at our number-one competitor’s company and knew what deals they
were in. He relentlessly questioned me on how we were going to win the deals
that they were in and how we planned to get into the deals that we weren’t in. He
wanted to know the strengths and weaknesses of everyone else on the team. He
wanted to know the game plan for winning. The topics of his potential
compensation and career advancement didn’t come up until the very end of the
process. And then he only wanted assurances that compensation was
performance-and not politically based. It was clear that Mark was all about the
team and its success.


During Mark’s tenure, sales increased more than tenfold, and our market
capitalization increased twentyfold. More to the point, voluntary attrition in the
sales organization was extremely low, customers were managed fairly and
honestly, and our legal and finance teams often commented that first and
foremost, Mark protected the company.


**FINAL THOUGHT**


While it may work to have individual employees who optimize for their own
careers, counting on senior managers to do all the right things for all the wrong
reasons is a dangerous idea.
