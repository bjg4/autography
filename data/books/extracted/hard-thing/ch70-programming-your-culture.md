# **PROGRAMMING YOUR CULTURE**

Ask ten founders about company culture and what it means and you’ll get ten
different answers. It’s about office design, it’s about screening out the wrong
kinds of employees, it’s about values, it’s about fun, it’s about alignment, it’s
about finding like-minded employees, it’s about being cultlike.

So what is culture? Does culture matter? If so, how much time should you
spend on it?

Let’s start with the second question first. The primary thing that any
technology startup must do is build a product that’s at least ten times better at
doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing. Two or
three times better will not be good enough to get people to switch to the new
thing fast enough or in large enough volume to matter. The second thing that any
technology startup must do is to _take the market_ . If it’s possible to do something
ten times better, it’s also possible that you won’t be the only company to figure
that out. Therefore, you must take the market before somebody else does. Very
few products are ten times better than the competition’s, so unseating the _new_
incumbent is much more difficult than unseating the old one.

If you fail to do both of those things, your culture won’t matter one bit. The
world is full of bankrupt companies with world-class cultures. Culture does not
make a company.

So, why bother with culture at all? Three reasons:


**1.** It matters to the extent that it can help you achieve the above goals.


**2.** As your company grows, culture can help you preserve your key values,
make your company a better place to work, and help it perform better in the
future.


**3.** Perhaps most important, after you and your people go through the
inhuman amount of work that it will take to build a successful company, it
will be an epic tragedy if your company culture is such that even you don’t
want to work there.


**CREATING A COMPANY CULTURE**


When I refer to company culture, I am not referring to other important activities
like company values and employee satisfaction. Specifically, I am writing about
designing a way of working that will:


Distinguish you from competitors


Ensure that critical operating values persist such as _delighting_ _customers_
or _making beautiful products_


Help you identify employees who fit with your mission


Culture means lots of other things in other contexts, but the above will be
plenty to discuss here.

When you start implementing your culture, keep in mind that most of what
will be retrospectively referred to as your company’s culture will not have been
designed into the system, but rather will have evolved over time based on your
behavior and the behavior of your early employees. As a result, you will want to
focus on a small number of cultural design points that will influence a large
number of behaviors over a long period of time.

In his bestselling book _Built to Last_, Jim Collins wrote that one of the things
that long-lasting companies he studied have in common is a “cultlike culture.” I
found this description to be confusing because it seems to imply that as long as
your culture is weird enough and you are rabid enough about it, you will succeed
on the cultural front.


That’s related to the truth, but not actually true. In reality, Collins was right
that a properly designed culture often ends up looking cultlike in retrospect, but
that’s not the initial design principle. You needn’t think hard about how you can
make your company seem bizarre to outsiders. However, you do need to think
about how you can be provocative enough to change what people do every day.

Ideally, a cultural design point will be trivial to implement but have farreaching behavioral consequences. Key to this kind of mechanism is shock
value. If you put something into your culture that is so disturbing that it always
creates a conversation, it will change behavior. As we learned in _The Godfather_,
ask a Hollywood mogul to give someone a job and he might not respond. Put a
horse’s head in his bed and unemployment will drop by one. Shock is a great
mechanism for behavioral change.

Here are three examples:


**Desks made out of doors** Very early on, Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of
Amazon.com, envisioned a company that made money by delivering value _to_
rather than extracting value _from_ its customers. In order to do that, he wanted to
be both the price leader and customer service leader for the long run. You can’t
do that if you waste a lot of money. Jeff could have spent years auditing every
expense and raining hell on anybody who overspent, but he decided to build
frugality into his culture. He did it with an incredibly simple mechanism: All
desks at Amazon.com for all time would be built by buying cheap doors from
Home Depot and nailing legs to them. These door desks are not great
ergonomically, nor do they fit with Amazon.com’s $150 billion–plus market
capitalization, but when a shocked new employee asks why she must work on a
makeshift desk constructed out of random Home Depot parts, the answer comes
back with withering consistency: “We look for every opportunity to save money
so that we can deliver the best products for the lowest cost.” If you don’t like
sitting at a door, then you won’t last long at Amazon.

**Ten dollars per minute** When we started Andreessen Horowitz, Marc and I
wanted the firm to treat entrepreneurs with great respect. We remembered how
psychologically brutal the process of building a company was. We wanted the
firm to respect the fact that in the bacon-and-egg breakfast of a startup, we were
with the chicken and the entrepreneur was the pig: We were involved, but she
was committed. We thought that one way to communicate respect would be to
always be on time to meetings with entrepreneurs. Rather than make them wait
in our lobby for thirty minutes while we attended to more important business
like so many venture capitalists that we visited, we wanted our people to be on
time, prepared, and focused. Unfortunately, anyone who has ever worked
anywhere knows that this is easier said than done. In order to shock the company
into the right behavior, we instituted a ruthlessly enforced ten-dollar-per-minute
fine for being late to a meeting with an entrepreneur. So, for example: You are
on a really important call and will be ten minutes late? No problem, just bring
one hundred dollars to the meeting and pay your fine. When new employees
come on board, they find this shocking, which gives us a great opportunity to
explain in detail why we respect entrepreneurs. If you don’t think entrepreneurs
are more important than venture capitalists, we can’t use you at Andreessen
Horowitz.


**Move fast and break things** Mark Zuckerberg believes in innovation and he
believes there can be no great innovation without great risk. So, in the early days
of Facebook, he deployed a shocking motto: _Move fast and break things._ Did the


CEO really want us to break things? I mean, he’s telling us to break things! A
motto that shocking forces everyone to stop and think. When they think, they
realize that if you move fast and innovate, you will break things. If you ask
yourself, “Should I attempt this breakthrough? It will be awesome, but it may
cause problems in the short term,” you have your answer. If you’d rather be right
than innovative, you won’t fit in at Facebook.

Prior to figuring out the exact form of your company’s shock therapy, be sure
that your mechanism agrees with your values. For example, Jack Dorsey will
never make his own desks out of doors at Square because at Square, beautiful
design trumps frugality. When you walk into Square, you can feel how seriously
they take design.


**WHY DOGS AT WORK AND YOGA AREN’T CULTURE**


Startups today do all kinds of things to distinguish themselves. Many great,
many original, many quirky, but most of them will not define the company’s
culture. Yes, yoga may make your company a better place to work for people
who like yoga. It may also be a great team-building exercise for people who like
yoga. Nonetheless, it’s not culture. It will not establish a core value that drives
the business and helps promote it in perpetuity. It is not specific with respect to
what your business aims to achieve. Yoga is a perk.

Somebody keeping a pit bull in her cube may be shocking. The lesson learned
—that animal lovers are welcome or that employees can live however they want
—may provide some societal value, but it does not connect to your business in a
distinguishing way. Every smart company values its employees. Perks are good,
but they are not culture.


**THE POINT OF IT ALL**


In the later section “How to Evaluate CEOs” (see page 235), I describe the CEO
job as knowing what to do and getting the company to do what you want.
Designing a proper company culture will help you get your company to do what
you want in certain important areas for a very long time.


# **TAKING THE MYSTERY OUT OF SCALING A** **COMPANY**

If you want to build an important company, then at some point you have to scale.
People in startup land often talk about the magic of how few people built the
original Google or the original Facebook, but today’s Google employs twenty
thousand people and today’s Facebook employs more than fifteen hundred
people. So, if you want to do something that matters, then you are going to have
to learn the black art of scaling a human organization.

Often board members give entrepreneurs two bits of advice regarding scale:


**1.** Get a mentor.


**2.** Find some “been there, done that” executives who already know how to
scale.


These answers, while fine as far as they go, have some important limitations.
First, if you don’t know anything about scaling an organization, then it will be
very difficult for you to evaluate people for that job. Imagine trying to find a
killer engineer if you’d never written a single program. Second, many investorboard members don’t know anything about scaling a company, either, and can be
suckers for people who have the experience but not the skills. If you’ve ever
worked in a large organization, you know that there are plenty of people with
experience running them but none of the requisite skills to run them well.

This advice is still good, but the right way to pick both the best mentors and
best employees is by first learning the basics; then you can apply the myriad of
scaling techniques in the management literature depending on the context.


**THE BASIC IDEA: GIVE GROUND GRUDGINGLY**


When an organization grows in size, things that were previously easy become
difficult. Specifically, the following things that cause no trouble when you are
small become big challenges as you grow:


Communication


Common knowledge


Decision making


In order to get a clear understanding of the problem, let’s start with the
boundary condition. Imagine a company of one employee. That employee writes
and tests all the code, does all the marketing and sales, and manages herself. She
has complete knowledge of everything in the company, makes all the decisions,
needn’t communicate with anyone, and is totally aligned with herself. As the
company grows, things will only get worse in each dimension.

On the other hand, if the company doesn’t expand, then it will never be much
of a company, so the challenge is to grow but degrade as slowly as possible.

There is a great analogue to this concept in American football. An offensive
lineman’s job is to protect the quarterback from onrushing defensive linemen. If
the offensive lineman attempts to do this by holding his ground, the defensive
lineman will easily run around him and crush the quarterback. As a result,
offensive linemen are taught to lose the battle slowly or _to give ground_
_grudgingly_ . They are taught to back up and allow the defensive lineman to
advance, but just a little at a time.

When you scale an organization, you will also need to give ground
grudgingly. Specialization, organizational structure, and process all complicate
things and implementing them will feel like you are moving away from common
knowledge and quality communication. It is very much like the offensive
lineman taking a step backward. You will lose ground, but you will prevent your
company from descending into chaos.


**HOW TO DO IT**


At the point when adding people into the company feels like more work than the
work that you can offload to the new employees, the defensive lineman has run
around you and you probably need to start giving ground grudgingly.


**SPECIALIZATION**


The first scale technique to implement is specialization. In startups, everybody
starts out as a jack-of-all-trades. For example, engineers write code, manage the
build system, test the product, and, increasingly, deploy it and operate it. This


works well in the beginning because everybody knows everything and the need
to communicate is minimized; there are no complicated handoffs, because there
is nobody to hand anything to. As the company grows, it becomes increasingly
difficult to add new engineers, because the learning curve starts to get supersteep. Getting a new engineer up to speed starts to become more difficult than
doing the work yourself. At this point, you need to specialize.

By dedicating people and teams to such tasks as the build environment, the
test environment, and operations, you will create some complexity—handoffs
across groups, potentially conflicting agendas, and specialized rather than
common knowledge. In order to mitigate these issues, you will need to consider
other scale techniques like _organizational design_ and _process_ .


**ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN**


The first rule of organizational design is that all organizational designs are bad.
With any design, you will optimize communication among some parts of the
organization at the expense of other parts. For example, if you put product
management in the engineering organization, you will optimize communication
between product management and engineering at the expense of communication
between product management and marketing. As a result, as soon as you roll out
the new organization, people will find fault with it and they will be right.

Nonetheless, at some point the monolithic design of one huge organization
runs out of gas and you will need to split things into smaller subgroups. At the
most basic level, you’ll want to consider giving the groups that you’ve
specialized their own managers as they grow. You may want a QA manager, for
example. After that, things become more complex. Do client engineering and
server engineering have their own groups or do you organize by use cases and
include all technical components? When you get really big, you’ll need to decide
whether to organize the entire company around functions (for example, sales,
marketing, product management, engineering) or around missions—selfcontained business units that contain multiple functions.

Your goal is to choose the least of all evils. Think of the organizational design
as the communications architecture for your company. If you want people to
communicate, the best way to accomplish that is to make them report to the
same manager. By contrast, the further away people are in the organizational
chart, the less they will communicate. The organizational design is also the
architecture for how the company communicates with the outside world. For


example, you might want to organize your sales force by product to maximize
communication with the relevant product groups and maximize the product
competency of the sales force. If you do that, then you will do so at the expense
of simplicity for customers who buy multiple products and will now have to deal
with multiple salespeople.

With this in mind, here are the basic steps to organizational design:


**1.** _Figure out what needs to be communicated._ Start by listing the most
important knowledge and who needs to have it. For example, knowledge of
the product architecture must be understood by engineering, QA, product
management, marketing, and sales.


**2.** _Figure out what needs to be decided._ Consider the types of decisions that
must get made on a frequent basis: feature selection, architectural decisions,
how to resolve support issues. How can you design the organization to put
the maximum number of decisions under the domain of a designated
manager?


**3.** _Prioritize the most important communication and decision paths._ Is it
more important for product managers to understand the product architecture
or the market? Is it more important for engineers to understand the
customer or the architecture? Keep in mind that these priorities will be
based on today’s situation. If the situation changes, then you can
reorganize.


**4.** _Decide who’s going to run each group._ Notice that this is the fourth step,
not the first. You want to optimize the organization for the people—for the
people doing the work—not for the managers. Most large mistakes in
organizational design come from putting the individual ambitions of the
people at the top of the organization ahead of the communication paths for
the people at the bottom of the organization. Making this step four will
upset your managers, but they will get over it.


**5.** _Identify the paths that you did not optimize._ As important as picking the
communication paths that you will optimize is identifying the ones that you
will not. Just because you deprioritized them doesn’t mean they are
unimportant. If you ignore them entirely, they will surely come back to bite

you.


**6.** _Build a plan for mitigating the issues identified in step five._ Once you’ve
identified the likely issues, you will know the processes you will need to


build to patch the impending cross-organizational challenges.


These six steps should get you pretty far. When we examine advanced
organizational design, we’ll also need to consider trade-offs such as speed versus
cost, how to roll out organizational changes, and how often you should
reorganize.


**PROCESS**


The purpose of process is communication. If there are five people in your
company, you don’t need process, because you can just talk to each other. You
can hand off tasks with a perfect understanding of what’s expected, you pass
important information from one person to another, and you can maintain highquality transactions with no bureaucratic overhead. With four thousand people,
communication becomes more difficult. Ad hoc, point-to-point communication
no longer works. You need something more robust—a communication bus or, to
use the conventional term for human communication buses, a process.

A process is a formal, well-structured communication vehicle. It can be a
heavily engineered Six Sigma process or it can be a well-structured regular
meeting. The size of the process should be scaled up or down to meet the needs
of the communication challenge that it facilitates.

When communication in an organization spans across organizational
boundaries, processes will help ensure that the communication happens and that
it happens with quality. If you are looking for the first process to implement in
your company, consider the interview process. It usually runs across
organizational boundaries (the hiring group, human resources—or wherever the
recruiter lives, and supporting groups), involves people from outside the
company (the candidate), and is critically important to the success of the

company.

Who should design a process? The people who are already doing the work in
an ad hoc manner. They know what needs to be communicated and to whom.
Naturally they will be the right group to formalize the existing process and make
it scalable.


When should you start implementing processes? While that varies depending
on your situation, keep in mind that it’s much easier to add new people to old
processes than new processes to old people. Formalize what you are doing to
make it easy to onboard new people.

Much has been written about process design, so I won’t repeat that here. I


have found the “The Basics of Production,” the first chapter of Andy Grove’s
_High Output Management_, to be particularly helpful. For new companies, here
are a few things to keep in mind:


_Focus on the output first._ What should the process produce? In the case
of the interview process, an outstanding employee. If that’s the goal, what’s
the process to get there?


_Figure out how you’ll know if you are getting what you want at each step._
Are you getting enough candidates? Are you getting the right candidates?
Will your interview process find the right person for the job? Once you
select the person, will they accept the job? Once they accept the job, will
they become productive? Once they become productive, will they stay with
your company? How will you measure each step?


_Engineer accountability into the system._ Which organization and which
individual is responsible for each step? What can you do to increase the
visibility of their performance?


**FINAL THOUGHT**


The process of scaling a company is not unlike the process of scaling a product.
Different sizes of company impose different requirements on the company’s
architecture. If you address those requirements too early, your company will
seem heavy and sluggish. If you address those requirements too late, your
company may melt down under the pressure. Be mindful of your company’s true
growth rate as you add architectural components. It’s good to anticipate growth,
but it’s bad to overanticipate growth.
