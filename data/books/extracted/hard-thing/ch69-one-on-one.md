# **ONE-ON-ONE**

After I first wrote about one-on-ones, people flooded me with feedback about
one-on-ones. About half the responders chastised me, saying that one-on-ones
were useless and that I shouldn’t put so much emphasis on them. The other half
wanted to know how to run more effective one-on-ones. It seems to me that both

groups are likely talking about two sides of the same coin.

Perhaps the CEO’s most important operational responsibility is designing and
implementing the communication architecture for her company. The architecture
might include the organizational design, meetings, processes, email, yammer,
and even one-on-one meetings with managers and employees. Absent a welldesigned communication architecture, information and ideas will stagnate, and
your company will degenerate into a bad place to work. While it is quite possible
to design a great communication architecture without one-on-one meetings, in
most cases one-on-ones provide an excellent mechanism for information and
ideas to flow up the organization and should be part of your design.

Generally, people who think one-on-one meetings are a bad idea have been
victims of poorly designed ones. The key to a good one-on-one meeting is the
understanding that it is the _employee’s_ meeting rather than the manager’s
meeting. This is the free-form meeting for all the pressing issues, brilliant ideas,
and chronic frustrations that do not fit neatly into status reports, email, and other
less personal and intimate mechanisms.

If you are an employee, how do you get feedback from your manager on an
exciting but only 20 percent formed idea that you’re not sure is relevant, without
sounding like a fool? How do you point out that a colleague you do not know
how to work with is blocking your progress without throwing her under the bus?
How do you get help when you love your job but your personal life is melting
down? Through a status report? On email? Yammer? Asana? Really? For these
and other important areas of discussions, one-on-ones can be essential.

If you like structured agendas, then the employee should set the agenda. A
good practice is to have the employee send you the agenda in advance. This will
give her a chance to cancel the meeting if nothing is pressing. It also makes clear
that it is her meeting and will take as much or as little time as she needs. During


the meeting, since it’s the employee’s meeting, the manager should do 10
percent of the talking and 90 percent of the listening. Note that this is the
opposite of most one-on-ones.

While it’s not the manager’s job to set the agenda or do the talking, the
manager should try to draw the key issues out of the employee. The more
introverted the employee, the more important this becomes. If you manage
engineers, drawing out issues will be an important skill to master.

Some questions that I’ve found to be very effective in one-on-ones:


If we could improve in any way, how would we do it?


What’s the number-one problem with our organization? Why?


What’s not fun about working here?


Who is really kicking ass in the company? Whom do you admire?


If you were me, what changes would you make?


What don’t you like about the product?


What’s the biggest opportunity that we’re missing out on?


What are we not doing that we should be doing?


Are you happy working here?


In the end, the most important thing is that the best ideas, the biggest
problems, and the most intense employee life issues make their way to the
people who can deal with them. One-on-ones are a time-tested way to do that,
but if you have a better one, go ahead with your bad self.
