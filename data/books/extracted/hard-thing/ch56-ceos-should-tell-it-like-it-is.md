# **CEOS SHOULD TELL IT LIKE IT IS**

One of the most important management lessons for a founder/CEO is totally
unintuitive. My single biggest personal improvement as CEO occurred on the
day when I stopped being too positive.

As a young CEO, I felt the pressure—the pressure of employees depending on
me, the pressure of not really knowing what I was doing, the pressure of being
responsible for tens of millions of dollars of other people’s money. As a
consequence of this pressure, I took losses extremely hard. If we failed to win a
customer or slipped a date or shipped a product that wasn’t quite right, it
weighed heavily on me. I thought that I would make the problem worse by
transferring that burden to my employees. Instead, I thought I should project a
positive, sunny demeanor and rally the unburdened troops to victory. I was
completely wrong.

I realized my error during a conversation with my brother in-law, Cartheu. At
the time, Cartheu worked for AT&T as a telephone lineman (he is one of those
guys who climb the poles). I had just met a senior executive at AT&T, whom I’ll
call Fred, and I was excited to find out if Cartheu knew him. Cartheu said,
“Yeah, I know Fred. He comes by about once a quarter to blow a little sunshine
up my ass.” At that moment, I knew that I’d been screwing up my company by
being too positive.

In my mind, I was keeping everyone in high spirits by accentuating the
positive and ignoring the negative. But my team knew that reality was more
nuanced than I was describing it. And not only did they see for themselves the
world wasn’t as rosy as I was describing it; they still had to listen to me blowing
sunshine up their butts at every company meeting.

How did I make such a mistake and why was it such a big mistake?


**THE POSITIVITY DELUSION**


As the highest-ranking person in the company, I thought that I would be best
able to handle bad news. The opposite was true: Nobody took bad news harder
than I did. Engineers easily brushed off things that kept me awake all night.


After all, I was the founding CEO. I was the one “married” to the company. If
things went horribly wrong, they could walk away, but I could not. As a
consequence, the employees handled losses much better.

Even more stupidly, I thought that it was my job and my job only to worry
about the company’s problems. Had I been thinking more clearly, I would have
realized that it didn’t make sense for me to be the only one to worry about, for
example, the product not being quite right—because I wasn’t writing the code
that would fix it.


A much better idea would have been to give the problem to the people who
could not only fix it, but who would also be personally excited and motivated to
do so. Another example: If we lost a big prospect, the whole organization needed
to understand why, so that we could together fix the things that were broken in
our products, marketing, and sales process. If I insisted on keeping the setbacks
to myself, there was no way to jump-start that process.


**WHY IT’S IMPERATIVE TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS**


There are three key reasons why being transparent about your company’s
problems makes sense:


**1. Trust.**


Without trust, communication breaks. More specifically:

In any human interaction, the required amount of communication is inversely
proportional to the level of trust.

Consider the following: If I trust you completely, then I require no
explanation or communication of your actions whatsoever, because I know that
whatever you are doing is in my best interests. On the other hand, if I don’t trust
you at all, then no amount of talking, explaining, or reasoning will have any
effect on me, because I do not trust that you are telling me the truth.

In a company context, this is a critical point. As a company grows,
communication becomes its biggest challenge. If the employees fundamentally
trust the CEO, then communication will be vastly more efficient than if they
don’t. Telling things as they are is a critical part of building this trust. A CEO’s
ability to build this trust over time is often the difference between companies
that execute well and companies that are chaotic.


**2. The more brains working on the hard problems, the better.**


In order to build a great technology company, you have to hire lots of incredibly
smart people. It’s a total waste to have lots of big brains but not let them work on
your biggest problems. A brain, no matter how big, cannot solve a problem it
doesn’t know about. As the open-source community would explain it, “Given
enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”


**3. A good culture is like the old RIP routing protocol: Bad news travels fast;**
**good news travels slow.**


If you investigate companies that have failed, you will find that many employees
knew about the fatal issues long before those issues killed the company. If the
employees knew about the deadly problems, why didn’t they say something?
Too often the answer is that the company culture discouraged the spread of bad
news, so the knowledge lay dormant until it was too late to act.

A healthy company culture encourages people to share bad news. A company
that discusses its problems freely and openly can quickly solve them. A
company that covers up its problems frustrates everyone involved. The resulting
action item for CEOs: Build a culture that rewards—not punishes—people for
getting problems into the open where they can be solved.

As a corollary, beware of management maxims that stop information from
flowing freely in your company. For example, consider the old management
standard: “Don’t bring me a problem without bringing me a solution.” What if
the employee cannot solve an important problem? For example, what if an
engineer identifies a serious flaw in the way the product is being marketed? Do
you really want him to bury that information? Management truisms like these
may be good for employees to aspire to in the abstract, but they can also be the
enemy of free-flowing information—which may be critical for the health of the

company.


**FINAL THOUGHT**


If you run a company, you will experience overwhelming psychological pressure
to be overly positive. Stand up to the pressure, face your fear, and tell it like it is.
