# **PREPARING TO FIRE AN EXECUTIVE**

When you recruit an executive, you paint a beautiful picture of her future in your
company. You describe in great depth and in vibrant color how awesome it will
be for her to accept your offer and how much better it will be than joining that
other company. Then one day you realize you must fire her. Reconcile that, Ms.
CEO.


It turns out that the actual act of firing an executive can be relatively easy
compared with any other firing. Executives have experience being on the other
side of the conversation and tend to be quite professional. Firing an executive
correctly is a bit more complicated and extremely important. If you do not learn
the right lessons, you will be doing it again soon.

Like so many things, the key to correctly firing an executive is preparation.
Here is a four-step process that will treat the executive fairly and improve your

company.


**STEP 1: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**


While it’s possible to fire an executive for bad behavior, incompetence, or
laziness, those cases are rare and relatively easy. Unfortunately, unless you have
a horribly deficient hiring process, those are probably not the reasons why you
got to this point. At this level, almost every company screens for the proper skill
set, motivation, and track record. Yes, the reason that you have to fire your head
of marketing is not because he sucks; it’s because _you_ suck.

In other words, the wrong way to view an executive firing is as an executive
failure; the correct way to view an executive firing is as an interview/integration
process system failure. Therefore, the first step to properly firing an executive is
figuring out why you hired the wrong person for your company.

You may have blown it for a variety of reasons:


_You did a poor job defining the position in the first place._ If you don’t
know what you want, you will be unlikely to get it. Far too often, CEOs
hire executives based on an abstract notion of what they think and feel the


executive should be like. This error often leads to the executive not

bringing the key, necessary qualities to the table.


_You hired for lack of weakness rather than for strengths._ This is
especially common when you run a consensus-based hiring process. The
group will often find the candidate’s weaknesses, but they won’t place a
high enough value on the areas where you need the executive to be a worldclass performer. As a result, you hire an executive with no sharp
weaknesses, but who is mediocre where you need her to be great. If you
don’t have world-class strengths where you need them, you won’t be a
world-class company.


_You hired for scale too soon._ The most consistently wrong advice that
venture capitalists and executive recruiters give CEOs is to hire someone
“bigger” than required. “Think about the next three to five years and how
you will be a large company” is how the bad advice usually sounds. It’s
great to hire people who can run a large-scale organization if you have one.
It’s also great to hire people who know how to grow an organization very
fast if you are ready to grow your organization very fast. However, if you
do not or you are not, then you need someone who can do the job for the
next eighteen months. If you hire someone who will be great _in_ eighteen
months but will be poor for the next eighteen months, the company will
reject her before she ever gets a chance to show her stuff. Your other
employees will wonder: Why did we give her all those stock options when
she’s not contributing anything? Those kinds of questions are impossible to
recover from. It turns out that venture capitalists and executive recruiters
are not stupid; they just learned the wrong lessons from previous failures.
To learn the right lesson, see the _special case of scaling_ and _the special_
_case of fast growth_ as explained below.


_You hired for the generic position._ There is no such thing as a great CEO,
a great head of marketing, or a great head of sales. There is only a great
head of sales for your company for the next twelve to twenty-four months.
That position is not the same as the same position at Microsoft or Facebook.
Don’t look for the candidate out of central casting. This is not a movie.


_The executive had the wrong kind of ambition._ In chapter 6, I will
describe the difference between ambition for the company and ambition for
oneself. If an executive has the wrong kind of ambition, then despite her
skills, the company may reject her.


_You failed to integrate the executive._ Bringing a new person into your
company in an important role is difficult. Other employees will be quick to
judge, her expectations may be different from yours, and the job may be
largely undefined. Be sure to review and improve your integration plan
after you fire an executive.


**The special case of scaling**


A fairly common reason for firing an executive is that when the company
quadruples in size, the executive no longer does the job effectively at the new
size. The reason is that when a company multiplies in size, the management jobs
become brand-new jobs. As a result, everybody needs to requalify for the new
job, because the new job and the old job are not the same. Running a twohundred-person global sales organization is not the same job as running a
twenty-five-person local sales team. If you get lucky, the person you hired to run
the twenty-five-person team will have learned how to run the two-hundredperson team. If not, you need to hire the right person for the new job. This is
neither an executive failure nor a system failure; it is life in the big city. Do not
attempt to avoid this phenomenon, as you will only make things worse.


**The special case of fast growth**


If you build a great product and the market wants it, you will find yourself
needing to grow your company extremely quickly. Nothing will ensure your
success like hiring the right executive who has grown an organization like yours
very quickly and successfully before. Note that this is not the same as inheriting
a very large organization or working your way up to running a very large
organization. Make sure you hire the right kind of fast-growth executive. Also,
do not hire this person if you are not ready to give them lots of budget to grow
their organization; expect them to do what they do. The successful fast-growth
executive is so important to building successful startups that recruiters and
venture capitalists often advise CEOs to bring them in before the company is
ready.

Once you identify the problem, then you create the basis for the next steps.


**STEP 2: INFORMING THE BOARD**


Informing the board is tricky and many issues can further complicate the task:


This is the fifth or sixth executive that you had to fire.


This is the third executive that you fired in this role.


The candidate was referred by a board member who recommended the
executive as a superstar.


Realize that in any of these cases the board will be at least somewhat alarmed
and there is nothing that you can do about that. But keep in mind that your
choices are: (a) alarm the board or (b) enable an ineffective executive to remain
in her position. While choice (a) is not great, it’s a heck of a lot better than
choice (b). Leaving a failing leader in place will cause an entire department in
your company to slowly rot. Let that happen and the board will be more than
alarmed.


You should have three goals with the board:


_Get their support and understanding for the difficult task that you will_
_execute._ You should start by making sure that they understand the root
cause and your plan to remedy the situation. This will give them confidence
in your ability to hire and manage outside executives in the future.


_Get their input and approval for the separation package._ This will be
critical for the next step. Executive packages are larger than regular
severance packages and rightly so. It takes about ten times longer for an
executive to find a new job than it does for an individual contributor.


_Preserve the reputation of the fired executive._ The failure was very likely
a team effort, and it’s best to portray it that way. You don’t make yourself
look good by trashing someone who worked for you. A mature approach to
this issue will help keep the board confident in your ability to be CEO. It’s
also the fair and decent thing to do.


Finally, firing an executive turns out to be a piece of news that’s handled
better with individual phone calls than in dramatic fashion during a board
meeting. It takes a bit longer, but it’s well worth the effort. Individual
conversations will be particularly important if one of the board members
introduced the executive to the company. Once everyone agrees individually,
you can finalize the details in a board meeting or call.


**STEP 3: PREPARING FOR THE CONVERSATION**


After you know what went wrong and have informed the board, you should tell
the executive as quickly as possible. In preparation for that meeting, I
recommend scripting or rehearsing what you plan to say so that you do not
misspeak. The executive will remember the conversation for a very long time, so
you need to get it right.


As part of your preparation, you should review any performance reviews or
written performance conversations to understand any inconsistencies in your
prior communication.

Three keys to getting it right:


**1.** _Be clear on the reasons._ You have thought about this long and hard;
don’t equivocate or sugarcoat it. You owe it to them to be clear about what
you think happened.


**2.** _Use decisive language._ Do not leave the discussion open-ended. This is
not a performance review; it’s a firing. Use words and phrases like “I have
decided” rather than “I think.”


**3.** _Have the severance package approved and ready._ Once the executive
hears the news, she will stop caring about the company and its issues; she
will be highly focused on herself and her family. Be ready to provide
specific details of the severance package.


Finally, the executive will be keenly interested in how the news will be
communicated to the company and to the outside world. It is best to let her
decide. Bill Campbell once gave me a critical bit of advice when I was preparing
to fire an executive. He said, “Ben, you cannot let him keep his job, but you
absolutely can let him keep his respect.”


**STEP 4: PREPARING THE COMPANY COMMUNICATION**


After you have informed the executive, you must quickly update the company
and your staff on the change. The correct order for informing the company is (1)
the executive’s direct reports—because they will be most impacted; (2) the other
members of your staff—because they will need to answer questions about it; and
(3) the rest of the company. All of these communications should happen on the
same day and preferably within a couple of hours. When disclosing the firing to
the direct reports, make sure that you have a plan for whom they will report to in
the meantime and what’s next (executive search, reorganization, internal
promotion, or something else). Generally, it’s smart for the CEO to act in the
executive role in the meanwhile. If you do act in the role, you must really act—
staff meetings, one-on-ones, objective setting, _etc._ Doing so will provide
excellent continuity for the team and greatly inform your thinking on whom to
hire next.


As you did when you updated the board, keep the message positive and refrain
from throwing the executive under the bus. The best employees in the
organization will likely be the ones closest to the executive. If you trash her, you
will put all her best employees on notice that they are next. Is that a message you
want to send?


When you update the company, you might worry about employees
misinterpreting the news and thinking the company is in trouble. Do not try to
maneuver around such a reaction. When you expect your employees to act like
adults, they generally do. If you treat them like children, then get ready for your
company to turn into one big _Barney_ episode.


**IN THE END**


Every CEO likes to say she runs a great company. It’s hard to tell whether the
claim is true until the company or the CEO has to do something really difficult.
Firing an executive is a good test.
