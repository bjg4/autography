# **LIES THAT LOSERS TELL**

When a company starts to lose its major battles, the truth often becomes the first
casualty. CEOs and employees work tirelessly to develop creative narratives that
help them avoid dealing with the obvious facts. Despite their intense creativity,
many companies often end up with the same false explanations.


**SOME FAMILIAR LIES**


“She left, but we were going to fire her, or give her a bad performance review.”
High-tech companies tend to track employee attrition in three categories:


**1.** People who quit


**2.** People who got fired


**3.** People who quit, but it’s okay because the company didn’t want them

anyway


Fascinatingly, as companies begin to struggle, the third category always seems
to grow much faster than the first. In addition, the sudden wave of “semiperformance-related attrition” usually happens in companies that claim to have a
“super-high talent bar.” How do all these superstar employees suddenly go from
great to crap? How is it possible that when you lose a top-rated employee before
you can say “unwanted attrition,” the manager carefully explains how her
performance fell off?

“We would have won, but the other guys gave the deal away.” “The customer
selected us technically and thinks we are the better company, but our competitor
just gave the product away. We would never sell so cheaply as it would hurt our
reputation.” Anybody who has ever run an enterprise sales force has heard this
lie before. You go into an account, you fight hard, and you lose. The sales rep,
not wanting to shine the light on himself, blames the “used car dealer” rep from
the other company. The CEO, not wanting to believe that she’s losing product
competitiveness, believes the rep. If you hear this lie, try to validate the claim
with the actual customer. I’ll bet you can’t.


“Just because we missed the intermediate milestones doesn’t mean we won’t

hit our product schedule.” In engineering meetings where there is great pressure
to ship on time—a customer commitment, a quarter that depends on it, or a
competitive imperative—everybody hopes for good news. When the facts don’t
align with the good news, a clever manager will find the narrative to make
everybody feel better—until the next meeting.

“We have a very high churn rate, but as soon as we turn on email marketing to
our user base, people will come back.” Yes, of course. The reason that people
leave our service and don’t come back is that we have not been sending them
enough spam. That makes total sense to me, too.

Where do lies come from?

To answer that question, I thought back to a conversation I had years ago with
the incomparable Andy Grove.

Back at the tail end of the Great Internet Bubble in 2001, as all the big
technology companies began missing their quarters by giant amounts, I found
myself wondering how none of them saw it coming. One would think that after
the dot-com crash of April 2000, companies like Cisco, Siebel, and HP would
realize that they would soon face a slowdown as many of their customers hit the
wall. But despite perhaps the most massive and public early warning system
ever, each CEO reiterated strong guidance right up to the point where they
dramatically whiffed their quarters.

I asked Andy why these great CEOs would lie about their impending fate.
He said they were not lying to investors, but rather, they were lying to
themselves.


Andy explained that humans, particularly those who build things, only listen
to leading indicators of good news. For example, if a CEO hears that
engagement for her application increased an incremental 25 percent beyond the
normal growth rate one month, she will be off to the races hiring more engineers
to keep up with the impending tidal wave of demand. On the other hand, if
engagement decreases 25 percent, she will be equally intense and urgent in
explaining it away: “The site was slow that month, there were four holidays, and
we made a UI change that caused all the problems. For gosh sakes, let’s not
panic!”

Both leading indicators may have been wrong, or both may have been right,
but our hypothetical CEO—like almost every other CEO—only took action on
the positive indicator and only looked for alternative explanations on the
negative leading indicator.


If this advice sounds too familiar. and you find yourself wondering why your
honest employees are lying to you, the answer is they are not. They are lying to
themselves.


And if you believe them, you are lying to yourself.
