# **STAYING GREAT**

As CEO, you know that you cannot build a world-class company unless you
maintain a world-class team. But how do you know if an executive is worldclass? Beyond that, if she was world-class when you hired her, will she stay
world-class? If she doesn’t, will she become world-class again?

These are complex questions and are made more complex by the courting
process. Every CEO sets out to hire the very best person in the world and then
recruits aggressively to get him. If he says yes, she inevitably thinks she’s hit the
jackpot. If I had a tattoo for every time I heard a CEO claim that she’d just hired
“the best VP in the industry,” I’d be Lil Wayne.

So we begin with a strong bias that whoever we hired must be world-class
even before performing one day of work. To make matters worse, executives
who start off world-class often deteriorate over time. If you are a sports fan, you
know that world-class athletes don’t stay world-class for long. One day you are
Terrell Owens and the next day you are Terrell Owens. While executives don’t
age nearly as fast as athletes do, companies, markets, and technologies change a
thousand times faster than the game of football. As a result, the executive who is
spectacular in this year’s hundred-person startup may be washed-up in next
year’s version when the company employs four hundred people and has $100
million in revenue.


**THE STANDARD**


The first thing to understand is that just because somebody interviewed well and
reference-checked great, that does not mean she will perform superbly in your
company. There are two kinds of cultures in this world: cultures where what you
do matters and cultures where all that matters is who you are. You can be the
former or you can suck.

You must hold your people to a high standard, but what is that standard? I
discussed this in the section “Old People.” In addition, keep the following in
mind:


_You did not know everything when you hired her._ While it feels awkward,
it is perfectly reasonable to change and raise your standards as you learn
more about what’s needed and what’s competitive in your industry.


_You must get leverage._ Early on, it’s natural to spend a great deal of time
integrating and orienting an executive. However, if you find yourself as
busy as you were with that function before you hired or promoted the
executive, then she is below standard.


_As CEO, you can do very little employee development._ One of the most
depressing lessons of my career when I became CEO was that I could not
develop the people who reported to me. The demands of the job made it
such that the people who reported to me had to be 99 percent ready to
perform. Unlike when I ran a function or was a general manager, there was
no time to develop raw talent. That can and must be done elsewhere in the
company, but not at the executive level. If someone needs lots of training,
she is below standard.


It is possible to take the standard setting too far. As I discussed in the section
“The Scale Anticipation Fallacy,” it’s neither necessary nor a good idea to
evaluate an executive based on what her job will be two years from now. You
can cross that bridge when you come to it. Evaluate her on how she performs
right here and right now.


**ON EXPECTATIONS AND LOYALTY**


If you have a great and loyal executive, how do you communicate all this? How
do you tell her that despite the massive effort and great job she is doing today,
you might fire her next year if she doesn’t keep up with the changes in the
business?


When I used to review executives, I would tell them, “You are doing a great
job at your current job, but the plan says that we will have twice as many
employees next year as we have right now. Therefore, you will have a new and
very different job and I will have to reevaluate you on the basis of that job. If it
makes you feel better, that rule goes for everyone on the team, including me.”

In providing this kind of direction, it’s important to point out to the executive
that when the company doubles in size, she has a new job. This means that doing
things that made her successful in her old job will not necessarily translate to
success in the new job. In fact, the number-one way that executives fail is by


continuing to do their old job rather than moving on to their new job.

But, what about being loyal to the team that got you here? If your current
executive team helped you grow your company tenfold, how can you dismiss
them when they fall behind in running the behemoth they created? The answer is
that your loyalty must go to your employees—the people who report to your
executives. Your engineers, marketing people, salespeople, and finance and HR
people who are doing the work. You owe them a world-class management team.
That’s the priority.
