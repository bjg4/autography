## 7MEASURE

t the beginning, a startup is little more than a model on a piece
# A of paper. The �nancials in the business plan include projections

of how many customers the company expects to attract, how
much it will spend, and how much revenue and pro�t that will
lead to. It’s an ideal that’s usually far from where the startup is in
its early days.
A startup’s job is to (1) rigorously measure where it is right now,
confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals, and then (2)
devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to
the ideal reflected in the business plan.
Most products—even the ones that fail—do not have zero
traction. Most products have some customers, some growth, and
some positive results. One of the most dangerous outcomes for a
startup is to bumble along in the land of the living dead. Employees
and entrepreneurs tend to be optimistic by nature. We want to keep
believing in our ideas even when the writing is on the wall. This is
why the myth of perseverance is so dangerous. We all know stories
of epic entrepreneurs who managed to pull out a victory when
things seemed incredibly bleak. Unfortunately, we don’t hear stories
about the countless nameless others who persevered too long,
leading their companies to failure.


WHY SOMETHING AS SEEMINGLY DULL AS ACCOUNTING WILL

CHANGE YOUR LIFE


People are accustomed to thinking of accounting as dry and boring,
a necessary evil used primarily to prepare �nancial reports and
survive audits, but that is because accounting is something that has
become taken for granted. Historically, under the leadership of
people such as Alfred Sloan at General Motors, accounting became
an essential part of the method of exerting centralized control over
far-�ung divisions. Accounting allowed GM to set clear milestones
for each of its divisions and then hold each manager accountable for
his or her division’s success in reaching those goals. All modern
corporations use some variation of that approach. Accounting is the
key to their success.
Unfortunately, standard accounting is not helpful in evaluating
entrepreneurs. Startups are too unpredictable for forecasts and
milestones to be accurate.
I recently met with a phenomenal startup team. They are well
�nanced, have signi�cant customer traction, and are growing
rapidly. Their product is a leader in an emerging category of
enterprise software that uses consumer marketing techniques to sell
into large companies. For example, they rely on employee-toemployee viral adoption rather than a traditional sales process,
which might target the chief information o�cer or the head of
information technology (IT). As a result, they have the opportunity
to use cutting-edge experimental techniques as they constantly
revise their product. During the meeting, I asked the team a simple
question that I make a habit of asking startups whenever we meet:
are you making your product better? They always say yes. Then I
ask: how do you know? I invariably get this answer: well, we are in
engineering and we made a number of changes last month, and our
customers seem to like them, and our overall numbers are higher
this month. We must be on the right track.
This is the kind of storytelling that takes place at most startup
board meetings. Most milestones are built the same way: hit a
certain product milestone, maybe talk to a few customers, and see if
the numbers go up. Unfortunately, this is not a good indicator of
whether a startup is making progress. How do we know that the
changes we’ve made are related to the results we’re seeing? More


cagesee adeaeeatedtoteesutseeseeg? oe
important, how do we know that we are drawing the right lessons
from those changes?
To answer these kinds of questions, startups have a strong need
for a new kind of accounting geared speci�cally to disruptive
innovation. That’s what innovation accounting is.


An Accountability Framework That Works Across Industries

Innovation accounting enables startups to prove objectively that
they are learning how to grow a sustainable business. Innovation
accounting begins by turning the leap-of-faith assumptions discussed
in Chapter 5 into a quantitative �nancial model. Every business
plan has some kind of model associated with it, even if it’s written
on the back of a napkin. That model provides assumptions about
what the business will look like at a successful point in the future.
For example, the business plan for an established manufacturing
company would show it growing in proportion to its sales volume.
As the pro�ts from the sales of goods are reinvested in marketing
and promotions, the company gains new customers. The rate of
growth depends primarily on three things: the pro�tability of each
customer, the cost of acquiring new customers, and the repeat
purchase rate of existing customers. The higher these values are, the
faster the company will grow and the more pro�table it will be.
These are the drivers of the company’s growth model.
By contrast, a marketplace company that matches buyers and
sellers such as eBay will have a di�erent growth model. Its success
depends primarily on the network e�ects that make it the premier
destination for both buyers and sellers to transact business. Sellers
want the marketplace with the highest number of potential
customers. Buyers want the marketplace with the most competition
among sellers, which leads to the greatest availability of products
and the lowest prices. (In economics, this sometimes is called
supply-side increasing returns and demand-side increasing returns.)
For this kind of startup, the important thing to measure is that the
network e�ects are working, as evidenced by the high retention rate


etoeectsaeo g,asedecedbytegetetoate
of new buyers and sellers. If people stick with the product with
very little attrition, the marketplace will grow no matter how the
company acquires new customers. The growth curve will look like
a compounding interest table, with the rate of growth depending on
the “interest rate” of new customers coming to the product.
Though these two businesses have very di�erent drivers of
growth, we can still use a common framework to hold their leaders
accountable. This framework supports accountability even when the
model changes.


HOW INNOVATION ACCOUNTING WORKS—THREE LEARNING

MILESTONES

Innovation accounting works in three steps: �rst, use a minimum
viable product to establish real data on where the company is right
now. Without a clear-eyed picture of your current status—no matter
how far from the goal you may be—you cannot begin to track your

progress.
Second, startups must attempt to tune the engine from the
baseline toward the ideal. This may take many attempts. After the
startup has made all the micro changes and product optimizations it
can to move its baseline toward the ideal, the company reaches a
decision point. That is the third step: pivot or persevere.
If the company is making good progress toward the ideal, that
means it’s learning appropriately and using that learning effectively,
in which case it makes sense to continue. If not, the management
team eventually must conclude that its current product strategy is
�awed and needs a serious change. When a company pivots, it
starts the process all over again, reestablishing a new baseline and
then tuning the engine from there. The sign of a successful pivot is
that these engine-tuning activities are more productive after the
pivot than before.


Establish the Baseline


For example, a startup might create a complete prototype of its
product and o�er to sell it to real customers through its main
marketing channel. This single MVP would test most of the startup’s
assumptions and establish baseline metrics for each assumption
simultaneously. Alternatively, a startup might prefer to build
separate MVPs that are aimed at getting feedback on one
assumption at a time. Before building the prototype, the company
might perform a smoke test with its marketing materials. This is an
old direct marketing technique in which customers are given the
opportunity to preorder a product that has not yet been built. A
smoke test measures only one thing: whether customers are
interested in trying a product. By itself, this is insu�cient to
validate an entire growth model. Nonetheless, it can be very useful
to get feedback on this assumption before committing more money
and other resources to the product.
These MVPs provide the first example of a learning milestone. An
MVP allows a startup to �ll in real baseline data in its growth
model—conversion rates, sign-up and trial rates, customer lifetime
value, and so on—and this is valuable as the foundation for learning
about customers and their reactions to a product even if that
foundation begins with extremely bad news.
When one is choosing among the many assumptions in a business
plan, it makes sense to test the riskiest assumptions first. If you can’t
�nd a way to mitigate these risks toward the ideal that is required
for a sustainable business, there is no point in testing the others. For
example, a media business that is selling advertising has two basic
assumptions that take the form of questions: Can it capture the
attention of a de�ned customer segment on an ongoing basis? and
can it sell that attention to advertisers? In a business in which the
advertising rates for a particular customer segment are well known,
the far riskier assumption is the ability to capture attention.
Therefore, the �rst experiments should involve content production
rather than advertising sales. Perhaps the company will produce a
pilot episode or issue to see how customers engage.


Tuning the Engine

Once the baseline has been established, the startup can work
toward the second learning milestone: tuning the engine. Every
product development, marketing, or other initiative that a startup
undertakes should be targeted at improving one of the drivers of its
growth model. For example, a company might spend time
improving the design of its product to make it easier for new
customers to use. This presupposes that the activation rate of new
customers is a driver of growth and that its baseline is lower than
the company would like. To demonstrate validated learning, the
design changes must improve the activation rate of new customers.
If they do not, the new design should be judged a failure. This is an
important rule: a good design is one that changes customer
behavior for the better.
Compare two startups. The �rst company sets out with a clear
baseline metric, a hypothesis about what will improve that metric,
and a set of experiments designed to test that hypothesis. The
second team sits around debating what would improve the product,
implements several of those changes at once, and celebrates if there
is any positive increase in any of the numbers. Which startup is
more likely to be doing e�ective work and achieving lasting
results?


Pivot or Persevere

Over time, a team that is learning its way toward a sustainable
business will see the numbers in its model rise from the horrible
baseline established by the MVP and converge to something like the
ideal one established in the business plan. A startup that fails to do
so will see that ideal recede ever farther into the distance. When
this is done right, even the most powerful reality distortion �eld
won’t be able to cover up this simple fact: if we’re not moving the
drivers of our business model, we’re not making progress. That
becomes a sure sign that it’s time to pivot.


INNOVATION ACCOUNTING AT IMVU

Here’s what innovation accounting looked like for us in the early
days of IMVU. Our minimum viable product had many defects and,
when we �rst released it, extremely low sales. We naturally
assumed that the lack of sales was related to the low quality of the
product, so week after week we worked on improving the quality
of the product, trusting that our e�orts were worthwhile. At the end
of each month, we would have a board meeting at which we would
present the results. The night before the board meeting, we’d run
our standard analytics, measuring conversion rates, customer counts,
and revenue to show what a good job we had done. For several
meetings in a row, this caused a last-minute panic because the
quality improvements were not yielding any change in customer
behavior. This led to some frustrating board meetings at which we
could show great product “progress” but not much in the way of
business results. After a while, rather than leave it to the last
minute, we began to track our metrics more frequently, tightening
the feedback loop with product development. This was even more
depressing. Week in, week out, our product changes were having
no effect.


Improving a Product on Five Dollars a Day

We tracked the “funnel metrics” behaviors that were critical to our
engine of growth: customer registration, the download of our
application, trial, repeat usage, and purchase. To have enough data
to learn, we needed just enough customers using our product to get
real numbers for each behavior. We allocated a budget of �ve
dollars per day: enough to buy clicks on the then-new Google
AdWords system. In those days, the minimum you could bid for a
click was 5 cents, but there was no overall minimum to your
spending. Thus, we could a�ord to open an account and get started
even though we had very little money. [1]


eetoug eadeytteoey.
Five dollars bought us a hundred clicks—every day. From a
marketing point of view this was not very signi�cant, but for
learning it was priceless. Every single day we were able to measure
our product’s performance with a brand new set of customers. Also,
each time we revised the product, we got a brand new report card
on how we were doing the very next day.
For example, one day we would debut a new marketing message
aimed at �rst-time customers. The next day we might change the
way new customers were initiated into the product. Other days, we
would add new features, �x bugs, roll out a new visual design, or
try a new layout for our website. Every time, we told ourselves we
were making the product better, but that subjective con�dence was
put to the acid test of real numbers.
Day in and day out we were performing random trials. Each day
was a new experiment. Each day’s customers were independent of
those of the day before. Most important, even though our gross
numbers were growing, it became clear that our funnel metrics
were not changing.
Here is a graph from one of IMVU’s early board meetings:


This graph represents approximately seven months of work. Over
that period, we were making constant improvements to the IMVU
product, releasing new features on a daily basis. We were
conducting a lot of in-person customer interviews, and our product
development team was working extremely hard.


Cohort Analysis

To read the graph, you need to understand something called cohort
analysis. This is one of the most important tools of startup analytics.
Although it sounds complex, it is based on a simple premise.


toug tsoudscope,tsbasedoaspepese.
Instead of looking at cumulative totals or gross numbers such as
total revenue and total number of customers, one looks at the
performance of each group of customers that comes into contact
with the product independently. Each group is called a cohort. The
graph shows the conversion rates to IMVU of new customers who
joined in each indicated month. Each conversion rate shows the
percentage of customer who registered in that month who
subsequently went on to take the indicated action. Thus, among all
the customers who joined IMVU in February 2005, about 60
percent of them logged in to our product at least one time.
Managers with an enterprise sales background will recognize this
funnel analysis as the traditional sales funnel that is used to manage
prospects on their way to becoming customers. Lean Startups use it
in product development, too. This technique is useful in many types
of business, because every company depends for its survival on
sequences of customer behavior called �ows. Customer �ows
govern the interaction of customers with a company’s products.
They allow us to understand a business quantitatively and have
much more predictive power than do traditional gross metrics.
If you look closely, you’ll see that the graph shows some clear
trends. Some product improvements are helping—a little. The
percentage of new customers who go on to use the product at least
�ve times has grown from less than 5 percent to almost 20 percent.
Yet despite this fourfold increase, the percentage of new customers
who pay money for IMVU is stuck at around 1 percent. Think
about that for a moment. After months and months of work,
thousands of individual improvements, focus groups, design
sessions, and usability tests, the percentage of new customers who
subsequently pay money is exactly the same as it was at the onset
even though many more customers are getting a chance to try the
product.
Thanks to the power of cohort analysis, we could not blame this
failure on the legacy of previous customers who were resistant to
change, external market conditions, or any other excuse. Each
cohort represented an independent report card, and try as we
might, we were getting straight C’s. This helped us realize we had a


gt,eeegettgstagtCs. sepeduseaeeada
problem.
I was in charge of the product development team, small though it
was in those days, and shared with my cofounders the sense that the
problem had to be with my team’s e�orts. I worked harder, tried to
focus on higher- and higher-quality features, and lost a lot of sleep.
Our frustration grew. When I could think of nothing else to do, I
was �nally ready to turn to the last resort: talking to customers.
Armed with our failure to make progress tuning our engine of
growth, I was ready to ask the right questions.
Before this failure, in the company’s earliest days, it was easy to
talk to potential customers and come away convinced we were on
the right track. In fact, when we would invite customers into the
o�ce for in-person interviews and usability tests, it was easy to
dismiss negative feedback. If they didn’t want to use the product, I
assumed they were not in our target market. “Fire that customer,”
I’d say to the person responsible for recruiting for our tests. “Find
me someone in our target demographic.” If the next customer was
more positive, I would take it as confirmation that I was right in my
targeting. If not, I’d fire another customer and try again.
By contrast, once I had data in hand, my interactions with
customers changed. Suddenly I had urgent questions that needed
answering: Why aren’t customers responding to our product
“improvements”? Why isn’t our hard work paying o�? For
example, we kept making it easier and easier for customers to use
IMVU with their existing friends. Unfortunately, customers didn’t
want to engage in that behavior. Making it easier to use was totally
beside the point. Once we knew what to look for, genuine
understanding came much faster. As was described in Chapter 3,
this eventually led to a critically important pivot: away from an IM
add-on used with existing friends and toward a stand-alone network
one can use to make new friends. Suddenly, our worries about
productivity vanished. Once our e�orts were aligned with what
customers really wanted, our experiments were much more likely
to change their behavior for the better.
This pattern would repeat time and again, from the days when
we were making less than a thousand dollars in revenue per month


eeea gesstaatousaddoas eeuepe ot
all the way up to the time we were making millions. In fact, this is
the sign of a successful pivot: the new experiments you run are
overall more productive than the experiments you were running
before.
This is the pattern: poor quantitative results force us to declare
failure and create the motivation, context, and space for more
qualitative research. These investigations produce new ideas—new
hypotheses—to be tested, leading to a possible pivot. Each pivot
unlocks new opportunities for further experimentation, and the
cycle repeats. Each time we repeat this simple rhythm: establish the
baseline, tune the engine, and make a decision to pivot or

persevere.


OPTIMIZATION VERSUS LEARNING

Engineers, designers, and marketers are all skilled at optimization.
For example, direct marketers are experienced at split testing value
propositions by sending a di�erent o�er to two similar groups of
customers so that they can measure di�erences in the response rates
of the two groups. Engineers, of course, are skilled at improving a
product’s performance, just as designers are talented at making
products easier to use. All these activities in a well-run traditional
organization o�er incremental bene�t for incremental e�ort. As
long as we are executing the plan well, hard work yields results.
However, these tools for product improvement do not work the
same way for startups. If you are building the wrong thing,
optimizing the product or its marketing will not yield signi�cant
results. A startup has to measure progress against a high bar:
evidence that a sustainable business can be built around its products
or services. That’s a standard that can be assessed only if a startup
has made clear, tangible predictions ahead of time.
In the absence of those predictions, product and strategy decisions
are far more di�cult and time-consuming. I often see this in my
consulting practice. I’ve been called in many times to help a startup
that feels that its engineering team “isn’t working hard enough.”


tateestattsegeegtea st o gadeoug.
When I meet with those teams, there are always improvements to
be made and I recommend them, but invariably the real problem is
not a lack of development talent, energy, or e�ort. Cycle after cycle,
the team is working hard, but the business is not seeing results.
Managers trained in a traditional model draw the logical
conclusion: our team is not working hard, not working e�ectively,
or not working efficiently.
Thus the downward cycle begins: the product development team
valiantly tries to build a product according to the speci�cations it is
receiving from the creative or business leadership. When good
results are not forthcoming, business leaders assume that any
discrepancy between what was planned and what was built is the
cause and try to specify the next iteration in greater detail. As the
speci�cations get more detailed, the planning process slows down,
batch size increases, and feedback is delayed. If a board of directors
or CFO is involved as a stakeholder, it doesn’t take long for
personnel changes to follow.
A few years ago, a team that sells products to large media
companies invited me to help them as a consultant because they
were concerned that their engineers were not working hard enough.
However, the fault was not in the engineers; it was in the process
the whole company was using to make decisions. They had
customers but did not know them very well. They were deluged
with feature requests from customers, the internal sales team, and
the business leadership. Every new insight became an emergency
that had to be addressed immediately. As a result, long-term
projects were hampered by constant interruptions. Even worse, the
team had no clear sense of whether any of the changes they were
making mattered to customers. Despite the constant tuning and
tweaking, the business results were consistently mediocre.
Learning milestones prevent this negative spiral by emphasizing a
more likely possibility: the company is executing—with discipline!
—a plan that does not make sense. The innovation accounting
framework makes it clear when the company is stuck and needs to
change direction.
In the example above, early in the company’s life, the product


teeapeaboe,eay tecopays e,tepoduct
development team was incredibly productive because the
company’s founders had identi�ed a large unmet need in the target
market. The initial product, while �awed, was popular with early
adopters. Adding the major features that customers asked for
seemed to work wonders, as the early adopters spread the word
about the innovation far and wide. But unasked and unanswered
were other lurking questions: Did the company have a working
engine of growth? Was this early success related to the daily work
of the product development team? In most cases, the answer was
no; success was driven by decisions the team had made in the past.
None of its current initiatives were having any impact. But this was
obscured because the company’s gross metrics were all “up and to
the right.”
As we’ll see in a moment, this is a common danger. Companies
of any size that have a working engine of growth can come to rely
on the wrong kind of metrics to guide their actions. This is what
tempts managers to resort to the usual bag of success theater tricks:
last-minute ad buys, channel stu�ng, and whiz-bang demos, in a
desperate attempt to make the gross numbers look better. Energy
invested in success theater is energy that could have been used to
help build a sustainable business. I call the traditional numbers
used to judge startups “vanity metrics,” and innovation accounting
requires us to avoid the temptation to use them.


VANITY METRICS: A WORD OF CAUTION

To see the danger of vanity metrics clearly, let’s return once more to
the early days of IMVU. Take a look at the following graph, which
is from the same era in IMVU’s history as that shown earlier in this
chapter. It covers the same time period as the cohort-style graph on
this page; in fact, it is from the same board presentation.
This graph shows the traditional gross metrics for IMVU so far:
total registered users and total paying customers (the gross revenue
graph looks almost the same). From this viewpoint, things look
much more exciting. That’s why I call these vanity metrics: they give


uc oeectg. ats ycateseatyetcs:teyge
the rosiest possible picture. You’ll see a traditional hockey stick
graph (the ideal in a rapid-growth company). As long as you focus
on the top-line numbers (signing up more customers, an increase in
overall revenue), you’ll be forgiven for thinking this product
development team is making great progress. The company’s growth
engine is working. Each month it is able to acquire customers and
has a positive return on investment. The excess revenue from those
customers is reinvested the next month in acquiring more. That’s
where the growth is coming from.


But think back to the same data presented in a cohort style.
IMVU is adding new customers, but it is not improving the yield on
each new group. The engine is turning, but the e�orts to tune the


eac egoup. eegestu g,butteeotstotuete
engine are not bearing much fruit. From the traditional graph
alone, you cannot tell whether IMVU is on pace to build a
sustainable business; you certainly can’t tell anything about the
efficacy of the entrepreneurial team behind it.
Innovation accounting will not work if a startup is being misled
by these kinds of vanity metrics: gross number of customers and so
on. The alternative is the kind of metrics we use to judge our
business and our learning milestones, what I call actionable metrics.


ACTIONABLE METRICS VERSUS VANITY METRICS

To get a better sense of the importance of good metrics, let’s look at
a company called Grockit. Its founder, Farbood Nivi, spent a decade
working as a teacher at two large for-pro�t education companies,
Princeton Review and Kaplan, helping students prepare for
standardized tests such as the GMAT, LSAT, and SAT. His engaging
classroom style won accolades from his students and promotions
from his superiors; he was honored with Princeton Review’s
National Teacher of the Year award. But Farb was frustrated with
the traditional teaching methods used by those companies. Teaching
six to nine hours per day to thousands of students, he had many
opportunities to experiment with new approaches. [2]

Over time, Farb concluded that the traditional lecture model of
education, with its one-to-many instructional approach, was
inadequate for his students. He set out to develop a superior
approach, using a combination of teacher-led lectures, individual
homework, and group study. In particular, Farb was fascinated by
how e�ective the student-to-student peer-driven learning method
was for his students. When students could help each other, they
bene�ted in two ways. First, they could get customized instruction
from a peer who was much less intimidating than a teacher.
Second, they could reinforce their learning by teaching it to others.
Over time, Farb’s classes became increasingly social—and successful.
As this unfolded, Farb felt more and more that his physical
presence in the classroom was less important. He made an


pesece tecassoo asess potat. e adea
important connection: “I have this social learning model in my
classroom. There’s all this social stu� going on on the web.” His
idea was to bring social peer-to-peer learning to people who could
not a�ord an expensive class from Kaplan or Princeton Review or
an even more expensive private tutor. From this insight Grockit was
born.
Farb explains, “Whether you’re studying for the SAT or you’re
studying for algebra, you study in one of three ways. You spend
some time with experts, you spend some time on your own, and
you spend some time with your peers. Grockit o�ers these three
same formats of studying. What we do is we apply technology and
algorithms to optimize those three forms.”
Farb is the classic entrepreneurial visionary. He recounts his
original insight this way: “Let’s forget educational design up until
now, let’s forget what’s possible and just redesign learning with
today’s students and today’s technology in mind. There were plenty
of multi-billion-dollar organizations in the education space, and I
don’t think they were innovating in the way that we needed them
to and I didn’t think we needed them anymore. To me, it’s really all
about the students and I didn’t feel like the students were being
served as well as they could.”
Today Grockit o�ers many di�erent educational products, but in
the beginning Farb followed a lean approach. Grockit built a
minimum viable product, which was simply Farb teaching test prep
via the popular online web conferencing tool WebEx. He built no
custom software, no new technology. He simply attempted to bring
his new teaching approach to students via the Internet. News about
a new kind of private tutoring spread quickly, and within a few
months Farb was making a decent living teaching online, with
monthly revenues of $10,000 to $15,000. But like many
entrepreneurs with ambition, Farb didn’t build his MVP just to
make a living. He had a vision of a more collaborative, more
e�ective kind of teaching for students everywhere. With his initial
traction, he was able to raise money from some of the most
prestigious investors in Silicon Valley.
When I �rst met Farb, his company was already on the fast track


We stetab,scopayasaeadyoteasttac
to success. They had raised venture capital from well-regarded
investors, had built an awesome team, and were fresh o� an
impressive debut at one of Silicon Valley’s famous startup
competitions.
They were extremely process-oriented and disciplined. Their
product development followed a rigorous version of the agile
development methodology known as Extreme Programming
(described below), thanks to their partnership with a San
Francisco–based company called Pivotal Labs. Their early product
was hailed by the press as a breakthrough.
There was only one problem: they were not seeing su�cient
growth in the use of the product by customers. Grockit is an
excellent case study because its problems were not a matter of
failure of execution or discipline.
Following standard agile practice, Grockit’s work proceeded in a
series of sprints, or one-month iteration cycles. For each sprint, Farb
would prioritize the work to be done that month by writing a series
of user stories, a technique taken from agile development. Instead
of writing a speci�cation for a new feature that described it in
technical terms, Farb would write a story that described the feature
from the point of view of the customer. That story helped keep the
engineers focused on the customer’s perspective throughout the
development process.
Each feature was expressed in plain language in terms everyone
could understand whether they had a technical background or not.
Again following standard agile practice, Farb was free to
reprioritize these stories at any time. As he learned more about
what customers wanted, he could move things around in the
product backlog, the queue of stories yet to be built. The only limit
on this ability to change directions was that he could not interrupt
any task that was in progress. Fortunately, the stories were written
in such a way that the batch size of work (which I’ll discuss in more
detail in Chapter 9) was only a day or two.
This system is called agile development for a good reason: teams
that employ it are able to change direction quickly, stay light on
their feet, and be highly responsive to changes in the business


te eet,adbe gyesposetocages tebusess
requirements of the product owner (the manager of the process—in
this case Farb—who is responsible for prioritizing the stories).
How did the team feel at the end of each sprint? They
consistently delivered new product features. They would collect
feedback from customers in the form of anecdotes and interviews

that indicated that at least some customers liked the new features.
There was always a certain amount of data that showed
improvement: perhaps the total number of customers was
increasing, the total number of questions answered by students was
going up, or the number of returning customers was increasing.
However, I sensed that Farb and his team were left with lingering
doubts about the company’s overall progress. Was the increase in
their numbers actually caused by their development e�orts? Or
could it be due to other factors, such as mentions of Grockit in the
press? When I met the team, I asked them this simple question:
How do you know that the prioritization decisions that Farb is
making actually make sense?
Their answer: “That’s not our department. Farb makes the
decisions; we execute them.”
At that time Grockit was focused on just one customer segment:
prospective business school students who were studying for the
GMAT. The product allowed students to engage in online study
sessions with fellow students who were studying for the same exam.
The product was working: the students who completed their
studying via Grockit achieved signi�cantly higher scores than they
had before. But the Grockit team was struggling with the age-old
startup problems: How do we know which features to prioritize?
How can we get more customers to sign up and pay? How can we
get out the word about our product?
I put this question to Farb: “How con�dent are you that you are
making the right decisions in terms of establishing priorities?” Like
most startup founders, he was looking at the available data and
making the best educated guesses he could. But this left a lot of
room for ambiguity and doubt.
Farb believed in his vision thoroughly and completely, yet he was
starting to question whether his company was on pace to realize


statgtoquesto ete scopayasopacetoeae
that vision. The product improved every day, but Farb wanted to
make sure those improvements mattered to customers. I believe he
deserves a lot of credit for realizing this. Unlike many visionaries,
who cling to their original vision no matter what, Farb was willing
to put his vision to the test.
Farb worked hard to sustain his team’s belief that Grockit was

destined for success. He was worried that morale would su�er if
anyone thought that the person steering the ship was uncertain
about which direction to go. Farb himself wasn’t sure if his team
would embrace a true learning culture. After all, this was part of
the grand bargain of agile development: engineers agree to adapt
the product to the business’s constantly changing requirements but
are not responsible for the quality of those business decisions.
Agile is an e�cient system of development from the point of
view of the developers. It allows them to stay focused on creating
features and technical designs. An attempt to introduce the need to
learn into that process could undermine productivity.
(Lean manufacturing faced similar problems when it was
introduced in factories. Managers were used to focusing on the
utilization rate of each machine. Factories were designed to keep
machines running at full capacity as much of the time as possible.
Viewed from the perspective of the machine, that is e�cient, but
from the point of view of the productivity of the entire factory, it is
wildly ine�cient at times. As they say in systems theory, that which
optimizes one part of the system necessarily undermines the system
as a whole.)
What Farb and his team didn’t realize was that Grockit’s progress
was being measured by vanity metrics: the total number of
customers and the total number of questions answered. That was
what was causing his team to spin its wheels; those metrics gave the
team the sensation of forward motion even though the company
was making little progress. What’s interesting is how closely Farb’s
method followed super�cial aspects of the Lean Startup learning
milestones: they shipped an early product and established some
baseline metrics. They had relatively short iterations, each of which
was judged by its ability to improve customer metrics.


asjudgedbytsabtyto poecustoe etcs.
However, because Grockit was using the wrong kinds of metrics,
the startup was not genuinely improving. Farb was frustrated in his
e�orts to learn from customer feedback. In every cycle, the type of
metrics his team was focused on would change: one month they
would look at gross usage numbers, another month registration
numbers, and so on. Those metrics would go up and down
seemingly on their own. He couldn’t draw clear cause-and-e�ect
inferences. Prioritizing work correctly in such an environment is
extremely challenging.
Farb could have asked his data analyst to investigate a particular
question. For example, when we shipped feature X, did it a�ect
customer behavior? But that would have required tremendous time
and e�ort. When, exactly, did feature X ship? Which customers
were exposed to it? Was anything else launched around that same
time? Were there seasonal factors that might be skewing the data?
Finding these answers would have required parsing reams and
reams of data. The answer often would come weeks after the
question had been asked. In the meantime, the team would have
moved on to new priorities and new questions that needed urgent
attention.
Compared to a lot of startups, the Grockit team had a huge
advantage: they were tremendously disciplined. A disciplined team
may apply the wrong methodology but can shift gears quickly once
it discovers its error. Most important, a disciplined team can
experiment with its own working style and draw meaningful
conclusions.


Cohorts and Split-tests

Grockit changed the metrics they used to evaluate success in two
ways. Instead of looking at gross metrics, Grockit switched to
cohort-based metrics, and instead of looking for cause-and-e�ect
relationships after the fact, Grockit would launch each new feature
as a true split-test experiment.
A split-test experiment is one in which di�erent versions of a


spttestepe etsoe cdeetesosoa
product are o�ered to customers at the same time. By observing the
changes in behavior between the two groups, one can make
inferences about the impact of the di�erent variations. This
technique was pioneered by direct mail advertisers. For example,
consider a company that sends customers a catalog of products to
buy, such as Lands’ End or Crate & Barrel. If you wanted to test a
catalog design, you could send a new version of it to 50 percent of
the customers and send the old standard catalog to the other 50
percent. To assure a scienti�c result, both catalogs would contain
identical products; the only di�erence would be the changes to the
design. To �gure out if the new design was e�ective, all you would
have to do was keep track of the sales �gures for both groups of
customers. (This technique is sometimes called A/B testing after the
practice of assigning letter names to each variation.) Although split
testing often is thought of as a marketing-speci�c (or even a direct
marketing–speci�c) practice, Lean Startups incorporate it directly
into product development.
These changes led to an immediate change in Farb’s
understanding of the business. Split testing often uncovers surprising
things. For example, many features that make the product better in
the eyes of engineers and designers have no impact on customer
behavior. This was the case at Grockit, as it has been in every
company I have seen adopt this technique. Although working with
split tests seems to be more di�cult because it requires extra
accounting and metrics to keep track of each variation, it almost
always saves tremendous amounts of time in the long run by
eliminating work that doesn’t matter to customers.
Split testing also helps teams re�ne their understanding of what
customers want and don’t want. Grockit’s team constantly added
new ways for their customers to interact with each other in the
hope that those social communication tools would increase the
product’s value. Inherent in those e�orts was the belief that
customers desired more communication during their studying.
When split testing revealed that the extra features did not change
customer behavior, it called that belief into question.
The questioning inspired the team to seek a deeper


equesto g spedtetea tosee adeepe
understanding of what customers really wanted. They brainstormed
new ideas for product experiments that might have more impact. In
fact, many of these ideas were not new. They had simply been
overlooked because the company was focused on building social
tools. As a result, Grockit tested an intensive solo-studying mode,
complete with quests and gamelike levels, so that students could
have the choice of studying by themselves or with others. Just as in
Farb’s original classroom, this proved extremely e�ective. Without
the discipline of split testing, the company might not have had this
realization. In fact, over time, through dozens of tests, it became
clear that the key to student engagement was to o�er them a
combination of social and solo features. Students preferred having a
choice of how to study.


Kanban

Following the lean manufacturing principle of kanban, or capacity
constraint, Grockit changed the product prioritization process.
Under the new system, user stories were not considered complete
until they led to validated learning. Thus, stories could be cataloged
as being in one of four states of development: in the product
backlog, actively being built, done (feature complete from a
technical point of view), or in the process of being validated.
Validated was de�ned as “knowing whether the story was a good
idea to have been done in the �rst place.” This validation usually
would come in the form of a split test showing a change in
customer behavior but also might include customer interviews or

surveys.
The kanban rule permitted only so many stories in each of the
four states. As stories �ow from one state to the other, the buckets
�ll up. Once a bucket becomes full, it cannot accept more stories.
Only when a story has been validated can it be removed from the
kanban board. If the validation fails and it turns out the story is a
bad idea, the relevant feature is removed from the product (see the
chart on this page).


KANBAN DIAGRAM OF WORK AS IT PROGRESSES

FROM STAGE TO STAGE


(No bucket can contain more than three projects at a time.)


Work on A begins. D and E are in development. F awaits validation.


F is validated. D and E await validation. G, H, I are new tasks to be undertaken. B and C


are being built. A completes development.


B and C have been built, but under kanban, cannot be moved to the next bucket for

validation until A, D, E have been validated. Work cannot begin on H and I until space


opens up in the buckets ahead.

I have implemented this system with several teams, and the


ae peetedtssyste tseeateas,adte
initial result is always frustrating: each bucket �lls up, starting with
the “validated” bucket and moving on to the “done” bucket, until
it’s not possible to start any more work. Teams that are used to
measuring their productivity narrowly, by the number of stories
they are delivering, feel stuck. The only way to start work on new
features is to investigate some of the stories that are done but
haven’t been validated. That often requires nonengineering e�orts:
talking to customers, looking at split-test data, and the like.
Pretty soon everyone gets the hang of it. This progress occurs in
�ts and starts at �rst. Engineering may �nish a big batch of work,
followed by extensive testing and validation. As engineers look for
ways to increase their productivity, they start to realize that if they
include the validation exercise from the beginning, the whole team
can be more productive.
For example, why build a new feature that is not part of a splittest experiment? It may save you time in the short run, but it will
take more time later to test, during the validation phase. The same
logic applies to a story that an engineer doesn’t understand. Under
the old system, he or she would just build it and �nd out later what
it was for. In the new system, that behavior is clearly
counterproductive: without a clear hypothesis, how can a story ever
be validated? We saw this behavior at IMVU, too. I once saw a
junior engineer face down a senior executive over a relatively
minor change. The engineer insisted that the new feature be splittested, just like any other. His peers backed him up; it was
considered absolutely obvious that all features should be routinely
tested, no matter who was commissioning them. (Embarrassingly,
all too often I was the executive in question.) A solid process lays
the foundation for a healthy culture, one where ideas are evaluated
by merit and not by job title.
Most important, teams working in this system begin to measure
their productivity according to validated learning, not in terms of
the production of new features.


Hypothesis Testing at Grockit


When Grockit made this transition, the results were dramatic. In
one case, they decided to test one of their major features, called
lazy registration, to see if it was worth the heavy investment they
were making in ongoing support. They were con�dent in this
feature because lazy registration is considered one of the design best
practices for online services. In this system, customers do not have
to register for the service up front. Instead, they immediately begin
using the service and are asked to register only after they have had
a chance to experience the service’s benefit.
For a student, lazy registration works like this: when you come to
the Grockit website, you’re immediately placed in a study session
with other students working on the same test. You don’t have to
give your name, e-mail address, or credit card number. There is
nothing to prevent you from jumping in and getting started
immediately. For Grockit, this was essential to testing one of its
core assumptions: that customers would be willing to adopt this
new way of learning only if they could see proof that it was
working early on.
As a result of this hypothesis, Grockit’s design required that it
manage three classes of users: unregistered guests, registered (trial)
guests, and customers who had paid for the premium version of the
product. This design required signi�cant extra work to build and
maintain: the more classes of users there are, the more work is
required to keep track of them, and the more marketing e�ort is
required to create the right incentives to entice customers to
upgrade to the next class. Grockit had undertaken this extra e�ort
because lazy registration was considered an industry best practice.
I encouraged the team to try a simple split-test. They took one
cohort of customers and required that they register immediately,
based on nothing more than Grockit’s marketing materials. To their
surprise, this cohort’s behavior was exactly the same as that of the
lazy registration group: they had the same rate of registration,
activation, and subsequent retention. In other words, the extra e�ort
of lazy registration was a complete waste even though it was
considered an industry best practice.


cosdeeda dustybestpactce.
Even more important than reducing waste was the insight that
this test suggested: customers were basing their decision about
Grockit on something other than their use of the product.
Think about this. Think about the cohort of customers who were
required to register for the product before entering a study session
with other students. They had very little information about the
product, nothing more than was presented on Grockit’s home page
and registration page. By contrast, the lazy registration group had a
tremendous amount of information about the product because they
had used it. Yet despite this information disparity, customer
behavior was exactly the same.
This suggested that improving Grockit’s positioning and
marketing might have a more signi�cant impact on attracting new
customers than would adding new features. This was just the �rst of
many important experiments Grockit was able to run. Since those
early days, they have expanded their customer base dramatically:
they now o�er test prep for numerous standardized tests, including
the GMAT, SAT, ACT, and GRE, as well as online math and English
courses for students in grades 7 through 12.
Grockit continues to evolve its process, seeking continuous
improvement at every turn. With more than twenty employees in
its San Francisco o�ce, Grockit continues to operate with the same
deliberate, disciplined approach that has been their hallmark all
along. They have helped close to a million students and are sure to
help millions more.


THE VALUE OF THE THREE A’S

These examples from Grockit demonstrate each of the three A’s of
metrics: actionable, accessible, and auditable.


Actionable

For a report to be considered actionable, it must demonstrate clear


oaepottobecosdeedactoabe,tustdeostatecea
cause and e�ect. Otherwise, it is a vanity metric. The reports that
Grockit’s team began to use to judge their learning milestones made
it extremely clear what actions would be necessary to replicate the
results.
By contrast, vanity metrics fail this criterion. Take the number of
hits to a company website. Let’s say we have 40,000 hits this month
—a new record. What do we need to do to get more hits? Well, that
depends. Where are the new hits coming from? Is it from 40,000
new customers or from one guy with an extremely active web
browser? Are the hits the result of a new marketing campaign or PR
push? What is a hit, anyway? Does each page in the browser count
as one hit, or do all the embedded images and multimedia content
count as well? Those who have sat in a meeting debating the units
of measurement in a report will recognize this problem.
Vanity metrics wreak havoc because they prey on a weakness of
the human mind. In my experience, when the numbers go up,
people think the improvement was caused by their actions, by
whatever they were working on at the time. That is why it’s so
common to have a meeting in which marketing thinks the numbers
went up because of a new PR or marketing e�ort and engineering
thinks the better numbers are the result of the new features it
added. Finding out what is actually going on is extremely costly,
and so most managers simply move on, doing the best they can to
form their own judgment on the basis of their experience and the
collective intelligence in the room.
Unfortunately, when the numbers go down, it results in a very
di�erent reaction: now it’s somebody else’s fault. Thus, most team
members or departments live in a world where their department is
constantly making things better, only to have their hard work
sabotaged by other departments that just don’t get it. Is it any
wonder these departments develop their own distinct language,
jargon, culture, and defense mechanisms against the bozos working
down the hall?
Actionable metrics are the antidote to this problem. When cause
and e�ect is clearly understood, people are better able to learn
from their actions. Human beings are innately talented learners


o teactos. uabegsae ateytaetedeaes
when given a clear and objective assessment.


Accessible

All too many reports are not understood by the employees and
managers who are supposed to use them to guide their decision
making. Unfortunately, most managers do not respond to this
complexity by working hand in hand with the data warehousing
team to simplify the reports so that they can understand them
better. Departments too often spend their energy learning how to
use data to get what they want rather than as genuine feedback to
guide their future actions.
There is an antidote to this misuse of data. First, make the reports
as simple as possible so that everyone understands them.
Remember the saying “Metrics are people, too.” The easiest way to
make reports comprehensible is to use tangible, concrete units.
What is a website hit? Nobody is really sure, but everyone knows
what a person visiting the website is: one can practically picture
those people sitting at their computers.
This is why cohort-based reports are the gold standard of learning
metrics: they turn complex actions into people-based reports. Each
cohort analysis says: among the people who used our product in
this period, here’s how many of them exhibited each of the
behaviors we care about. In the IMVU example, we saw four
behaviors: downloading the product, logging into the product from
one’s computer, engaging in a chat with other customers, and
upgrading to the paid version of the product. In other words, the
report deals with people and their actions, which are far more
useful than piles of data points. For example, think about how hard
it would have been to tell if IMVU was being successful if we had
reported only on the total number of person-to-person
conversations. Let’s say we have 10,000 conversations in a period. Is
that good? Is that one person being very, very social, or is it 10,000
people each trying the product one time and then giving up?
There’s no way to know without creating a more detailed report.


eesoayto o toutceatgaoedetaedepot.
As the gross numbers get larger, accessibility becomes more and
more important. It is hard to visualize what it means if the number
of website hits goes down from 250,000 in one month to 200,000
the next month, but most people understand immediately what it
means to lose 50,000 customers. That’s practically a whole stadium
full of people who are abandoning the product.
Accessibility also refers to widespread access to the reports.
Grockit did this especially well. Every day their system
automatically generated a document containing the latest data for
every single one of their split-test experiments and other leap-offaith metrics. This document was mailed to every employee of the
company: they all always had a fresh copy in their e-mail in-boxes.
The reports were well laid out and easy to read, with each
experiment and its results explained in plain English.
Another way to make reports accessible is to use a technique we
developed at IMVU. Instead of housing the analytics or data in a
separate system, our reporting data and its infrastructure were
considered part of the product itself and were owned by the
product development team. The reports were available on our
website, accessible to anyone with an employee account.
Each employee could log in to the system at any time, choose
from a list of all current and past experiments, and see a simple
one-page summary of the results. Over time, those one-page
summaries became the de facto standard for settling product
arguments throughout the organization. When people needed
evidence to support something they had learned, they would bring
a printout with them to the relevant meeting, con�dent that
everyone they showed it to would understand its meaning.


Auditable

When informed that their pet project is a failure, most of us are
tempted to blame the messenger, the data, the manager, the gods,
or anything else we can think of. That’s why the third A of good
metrics, “auditable,” is so essential. We must ensure that the data is


etcs,audtabe,ssoesseta.Weustesuetattedatas
credible to employees.
The employees at IMVU would brandish one-page reports to
demonstrate what they had learned to settle arguments, but the
process often wasn’t so smooth. Most of the time, when a manager,
developer, or team was confronted with results that would kill a
pet project, the loser of the argument would challenge the veracity
of the data.
Such challenges are more common than most managers would
admit, and unfortunately, most data reporting systems are not
designed to answer them successfully. Sometimes this is the result of
a well-intentioned but misplaced desire to protect the privacy of
customers. More often, the lack of such supporting documentation
is simply a matter of neglect. Most data reporting systems are not
built by product development teams, whose job is to prioritize and
build product features. They are built by business managers and
analysts. Managers who must use these systems can only check to
see if the reports are mutually consistent. They all too often lack a
way to test if the data is consistent with reality.
The solution? First, remember that “Metrics are people, too.” We
need to be able to test the data by hand, in the messy real world, by
talking to customers. This is the only way to be able to check if the
reports contain true facts. Managers need the ability to spot check
the data with real customers. It also has a second bene�t: systems
that provide this level of auditability give managers and
entrepreneurs the opportunity to gain insights into why customers
are behaving the way the data indicate.
Second, those building reports must make sure the mechanisms
that generate the reports are not too complex. Whenever possible,
reports should be drawn directly from the master data, rather than
from an intermediate system, which reduces opportunities for error.
I have noticed that every time a team has one of its judgments or
assumptions overturned as a result of a technical problem with the
data, its confidence, morale, and discipline are undermined.


When we watch entrepreneurs succeed in the mythmaking world of
Hollywood, books, and magazines, the story is always structured the
same way. First, we see the plucky protagonist having an epiphany,
hatching a great new idea. We learn about his or her character and
personality, how he or she came to be in the right place at the right
time, and how he or she took the dramatic leap to start a business.
Then the photo montage begins. It’s usually short, just a few
minutes of time-lapse photography or narrative. We see the
protagonist building a team, maybe working in a lab, writing on
whiteboards, closing sales, pounding on a few keyboards. At the
end of the montage, the founders are successful, and the story can
move on to more interesting fare: how to split the spoils of their
success, who will appear on magazine covers, who sues whom, and
implications for the future.
Unfortunately, the real work that determines the success of
startups happens during the photo montage. It doesn’t make the cut
in terms of the big story because it is too boring. Only 5 percent of
entrepreneurship is the big idea, the business model, the
whiteboard strategizing, and the splitting up of the spoils. The other
95 percent is the gritty work that is measured by innovation
accounting: product prioritization decisions, deciding which
customers to target or listen to, and having the courage to subject a
grand vision to constant testing and feedback.
One decision stands out above all others as the most di�cult, the
most time-consuming, and the biggest source of waste for most
startups. We all must face this fundamental test: deciding when to
pivot and when to persevere. To understand what happens during
the photo montage, we have to understand how to pivot, and that is
the subject of Chapter 8.
