## 14JOIN THE MOVEMENT

n the past few years, the Lean Startup movement has gone global.
# I The number of resources available for aspiring entrepreneurs is

incredible. Here, I’ll do my best to list just a few of the best
events, books, and blogs for further reading and further practice.
The rest is up to you. Reading is good, action is better.
The most important resources are local. Gone are the days where
you had to be in Silicon Valley to �nd other entrepreneurs to share
ideas and struggles with. However, being embedded in a startup
ecosystem is still an important part of entrepreneurship. What’s
changed is that these ecosystems are springing up in more and more
startup hubs around the world.
I maintain an o�cial website for The Lean Startup at
http://theleanstartup.com, where you can �nd additional resources,
including case studies and links to further reading. You will also
�nd links there to my blog, Startup Lessons Learned, as well as
videos, slides, and audio from my past presentations.


Lean Startup Meetups

Chances are there is a Lean Startup meetup group near you. As of
this writing, there are over a hundred, with the largest in San
Francisco, Boston, New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. You can
�nd a real-time map of groups here: http://leanstartup.meetup.com/. You can also �nd a list of cities where people
are interested in starting a new group, and tools to set one up


ae teested statgae goup,adtoostosetoeup
yourself.


The Lean Startup Wiki

Not every Lean Startup group uses Meetup.com to organize, and a
comprehensive list of events and other resources is maintained by
volunteers on the Lean Startup Wiki:
http://leanstartup.pbworks.com/


The Lean Startup Circle

The largest community of practice around the Lean Startup is
happening online, right now, on the Lean Startup Circle mailing
list. Founded by Rich Collins, the list has thousands of
entrepreneurs sharing tips, resources, and stories every day. If you
have a question about how Lean Startup might apply to your
business or industry, it’s a great place to start:
http://leanstartupcircle.com/


The Startup Lessons Learned Conference

For the past two years, I have run a conference called Startup
Lessons Learned. More details are available here: http://sllconf.com


REQUIRED READING

Steve Blank’s book The Four Steps to the Epiphany is the original
book about customer development. When I was building IMVU, a
dog-eared copy of this book followed me everywhere. It is an
indispensable guide. You can get a copy here:
http://ericri.es/FourSteps or read my review of it here:
http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customerdevelopment.html. Steve also maintains an active and excellent


deeopet.t .Steeaso atasaacteadeceet
blog at http://steveblank.com/
Brant Cooper and Patrick Vlaskovits have created a short but
excellent book called The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer
Development, which provides a gentle introduction to the topic.
You can buy it here: http://custdev.com or read my review here:
http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/07/entrepreneursguide-to-customer.html


When I �rst began blogging about entrepreneurship, it was not
nearly as common an occupation as it is now. Very few bloggers
were actively working on new ideas about entrepreneurship, and
together we debated and refined these ideas online.
Dave McClure, founder of the venture �rm 500 Startups, writes a
blog at http://500hats.typepad.com/. 500 Startups has an excellent
blog as well: http://blog.500startups.com/. Dave’s “Startup Metrics
for Pirates” presentation laid out a framework for thinking about
and measuring online services that greatly in�uenced the concept of
“engines of growth.” You can see the original presentation here:
http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2008/09/startup-metri2.html as well as my original reaction here:
http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/three-drivers-ofgrowth-for-your.html
Sean Ellis writes the Startup Marketing Blog, which has been
in�uential in my thinking about how to integrate marketing into
startups: http://startup-marketing.com/
Andrew Chen’s blog Futuristic Play is one of the best sources for
thoughts on viral marketing, startup metrics, and design:
http://andrewchenblog.com/
Babak Nivi writes the excellent blog Venture Hacks and was an
early Lean Startup evangelist: http://venturehacks.com/. He’s since
gone on to create Angel List, which matches startups and investors
around the world: http://angel.co/


Other fantastic Lean Startup blogs include:


 - Ash Maurya has emerged as a leader in helping bootstrapped
online businesses apply Lean Startup ideas. His blog is called
Running Lean, and he also has released an eBook of the same
name. Both can be found here:
http://www.runningleanhq.com/

  - Sean Murphy on early-stage software startups:

 - Patrick Vlaskovits on technology, customer development, and
pricing: http://vlaskovits.com/

 - The KISSmetrics Marketing Blog: http://blog.kissmetrics.com/
and Hiten Shah’s http://hitenism.com


FURTHER READING

Clayton M. Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma and The
Innovator’s Solution are classics. In addition, Christensen’s more
recent work is also extremely helpful for seeing the theory of
disruptive innovation in practice, including The Innovator’s
Prescription (about disrupting health care) and Disrupting Class
(about education).
http://ericri.es/ClaytonChristensen


Geo�rey A. Moore’s early work is famous among all entrepreneurs,
especially Crossing the Chasm and Inside the Tornado. But he has
continued to re�ne his thinking, and I have found his latest work,
Dealing with Darwin: How Great Companies Innovate at Every
Phase of Their Evolution, especially useful.

## Endnotes

Introduction

1. For an up-to-date listing of Lean Startup meetups or to �nd one
near you, see http://​lean-​startup.​meetup.​com or the Lean
Startup Wiki: http://​leanstartup.​pbworks.​com/​Meetups. See also
Chapter 14, “Join the Movement.”


Chapter 1. Start

1. Manufacturing statistics and analysis are drawn from the blog
Five Thirty Eight: http://​www.​fivethirtyeight.​com/​2010/​02/​us-​
manufacturing-​is-​not-​dead.​html


Chapter 2. Define

1. The Innovator’s Dilemma is a classic text by Clayton Christensen
about the di�culty established companies have with disruptive
innovation. Along with its sequel, The Innovator’s Solution, it
lays out speci�c suggestions for how established companies can
create autonomous divisions to pursue startup-like innovation.
These speci�c structural prerequisites are discussed in detail in
Chapter 12.

2. For more about SnapTax, see http://​blog.​turbotax.​intuit.​com/​

3. Most information relating to Intuit and SnapTax comes from
private interviews with Intuit management and employees.
Information about Intuit’s founding comes from Suzanne Taylor
and Kathy Schroeder’s Inside Intuit: How the Makers of Quicken
Beat Microsoft and Revolutionized an Entire Industry
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Business Press, 2003).


Chapter 3. Learn

1. The original �ve founders of IMVU were Will Harvey, Marcus
Gosling, Matt Danzig, Mel Guymon, and myself.
2. Usage in the United States was even more concentrated; see
http://​www.​businessweek.​com/​technology/​tech_stats/​
im050307.​htm

3. To hear more about IMVU’s early conversations with customers
that led to our pivot away from the add-on strategy, see: http://​
mixergy.​com/​ries-​lean/
4. A word of caution: demonstrating validated learning requires the
right kind of metrics, called actionable metrics, which are
discussed in Chapter 7.

5. This case was written by Bethany Coates under the direction of
Professor Andy Rachle�. You can get a copy here: http://​hbr.​
org/​product/​imvu/​an/​E254-​PDF-​ENG


Chapter 4. Experiment

1. Some entrepreneurs have adopted this slogan as their startup
philosophy, using the acronym JFDI. A recent example can be
seen at http://​www.​cloudave.​com/​1171/​what-​makes-​an-​
entrepreneur-​four​-letters-​jfdi/

2. http://​techcrunch.​com/​2009/​11/​02/​amazon-​closes-​zappos-​deal-​
ends-​up-​paying-​1–2-​billion/


3. I want to thank Caroline Barlerin and HP for allowing me to
include my experimental analysis of this new project.
4. Information about Kodak Gallery comes from interviews
conducted by Sara Leslie.
5. The VLS story was recounted by Elnor Rozenrot, formerly of
Innosight Ventures. Additional detail was provided by Akshay
Mehra. For more on the VLS, see the article in Harvard Business
Review: http://​hbr.​org/​2011/​01/​new-​business-​models-​in-​
emerging-​markets/​ar/1 or press coverage at http://​
economictimes.​indiatimes.​com/​news/​news-​by-​company/​

articleshow/​5325032.​cms

6. For more on the early e�orts of the CFPB, see the Wall Street
Journal’s April 13, 2011, article “For Complaints, Don’t Call
Consumer Bureau Yet”; http://​online.​wsj.​com/​article/​SB100​
01424​05274​87035​51304​57626​07723​57440​148.​html. Many
dedicated public servants are currently working hard to
incorporate this experimental approach in the public sector
under the leadership of President Obama. I would like to thank
Aneesh Chopra, Chris Vein, Todd Park, and David Forrest for
introducing me to these groundbreaking efforts.


Chapter 5. Leap

1. For example, CU Community, which began at Columbia
University, had an early head start. See http://​www.​slate.​com/​
id/​2269131/. This account of Facebook’s founding is drawn
from David Kirkpatrick’s The Facebook Effect (New York: Simon
& Schuster, 2011).

2. Actual engagement numbers from 2004 are hard to �nd, but this
pattern has been consistent throughout Facebook’s public
statements. For example, Chris Hughes reported in 2005 that
“60% log in daily. About 85% log in at least once a week, and
93% log in at least once a month.” http://techcrunch.com/


93%og ateastocea ot. ttp://teccuc.co/
2005/​09/​07/​85-​of-​college-​students-​use-​facebook/

3. I �rst heard the term leap of faith applied to startup assumptions
by Randy Komisar, a former colleague and current partner at the
venture �rm Kleiner Perkins Cau�eld & Byers. He expands on
the concept in his book Getting to Plan B, coauthored with John
Mullins.

4. http://​www.​forbes.​com/​2009/​09/​17/​venture-​capital-​ipod-​
intelligent-​technology-​komisar.​html
5. “A carefully researched table compiled for Motor magazine by
Charles E. Duryea, himself a pioneer carmaker, revealed that
from 1900 to 1908, 501 companies were formed in the United
States for the purpose of manufacturing automobiles. Sixty
percent of them folded outright within a couple of years;
another 6 percent moved into other areas of production.” This
quote is from the Ford biography The People’s Tycoon: Henry
Ford and the American Century by Steven Watts (New York:
Vintage, 2006).
6. Jeffrey K. Liker, The Toyota Way. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003,
p. 223.

7. http://​www.​autofieldguide.​com/​articles/​030302.​html

8. In the customer development model, this is called customer
discovery.
9. For more on the founding of Intuit, see Suzanne Taylor and Kathy
Schroeder, Inside Intuit.

Chapter 6. Test

1. http://​www.​pluggd.​in/​groupon-​story-​297/
2. “Groupon’s $6 Billion Gambler,” Wall Street Journal; http://


.Goupos$6BoGabe,WaSteetJoua; ttp://

76021​48141​06354​32-IMyQj​AxMTA​wMDEw​ODExN​DgyWj.​html

3. The term minimum viable product has been in use since at least
2000 as part of various approaches to product development. For
an academic example, see http://​www2.​cs.​uidaho.​edu/​
~billjunk/​Publications/​DynamicBalance.​pdf


See also Frank Robinson of PMDI, who refers to a version of
the product that is the smallest needed to sell to potential
customers (http://​productdevelopment.​com/​howitworks/​mvp.​
html). This is similar to Steve Blank’s concept of the “minimum
feature set” in customer development (http://​steveblank.​com/​
2010/​03/​04/​perfection-​by-​subtraction-​the-​minimum-​feature-​
set/). My use of the term here has been generalized to any
version of a product that can begin the process of learning, using
the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. For more, see http://​
www.​startuplessonslearned.​com/​2009/​08/​minimum-​viable-​
product-​guide.​html
4. Many people have written about this phenomenon, using varying
terminology. Probably the most widely read is Geo�rey Moore’s
Crossing the Chasm. For more, see Eric Von Hippel’s research
into what he termed “lead users”; his book The Sources of
Innovation is a great place to start. Steve Blank uses the term
earlyvangelist to emphasize the evangelical powers of these
early customers.

5. “To the casual observer, the Dropbox demo video looked like a
normal product demonstration,” Drew says, “but we put in
about a dozen Easter eggs that were tailored for the Digg
audience. References to Tay Zonday and ‘Chocolate Rain’ and
allusions to O�ce Space and XKCD. It was a tongue-in-cheek
nod to that crowd, and it kicked o� a chain reaction. Within 24
hours, the video had more than 10,000 Diggs.” http://​answers.​

1. By contrast, Google’s main competitor Overture (eventually
bought by Yahoo) had a minimum account size of $50, which
deterred us from signing up, as it was too expensive.

6. Business architecture is a concept explored in detail in Moore’s
Dealing with Darwin. “Organizational structure based on
prioritizing one of two business models (Complex systems
model and Volume operations model). Innovation types are
understood and executed in completely di�erent ways
depending on which model an enterprise adopts.” For more, see

2. If you’re having trouble accepting this fact, it really is helpful to
watch it on video. One extremely detail-oriented blogger took
one video and broke it down, second-by-second, to see where
the time went: “You lose between 2 and 5 seconds every time
you move the pile around between steps. Also, you have to


you oetepeaoudbeteesteps. so,youaeto
manage the pile several times during a task, something you
don’t have to do nearly as much with [single-piece �ow]. This
also has a factory corollary: storing, moving, retrieving, and
looking for work in progress inventory.” See the rest of the
commentary here: http://​lssacademy.​com/​2008/​03/​24/​a-​

3. Timothy Fitz, an early IMVU engineer, deserves credit for having
coined the term continuous deployment in a blog post: http://​
timothyfitz.​wordpress.​com/​2009/​02/​10/​continuous-​
deployment-​at-​imvu-​doing-​the-​impossible-​fifty-​times-​a-​day/. The
actual development of the continuous deployment system is the
work of too many di�erent engineers at IMVU for me to give
adequate credit here. For details on how to get started with
continuous deployment, see http://​radar.​oreilly.​com/​2009/​03/​

## Acknowledgments

I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the many people who have
helped make The Lean Startup a reality. First and foremost are the
thousands of entrepreneurs around the world who have tested these
ideas, challenged them, re�ned them, and improved them. Without
their relentless—and mostly unheralded—work every day, none of
this would be possible. Thank you.
Real startups involve failure, embarrassing mistakes, and constant
chaos. In my research for this book, I discovered that most
entrepreneurs and managers would prefer not to have the real story
of their daily work told in public. Therefore, I am indebted to the
courageous entrepreneurs who consented to have their stories told,
many of whom spent hours in tedious interviews and fact-checking
conversations. Thank you.
I have been grateful throughout my career to have mentors and
collaborators who have pushed me to accomplish more than I could
have on my own. Will Harvey is responsible for both recruiting me
to Silicon Valley in the �rst place and for trusting me with the
opportunity to try out many of these ideas for the �rst time at
IMVU. I am grateful to my other IMVU cofounders Marcus Gosling,
Matt Danzig, and Mel Guymon as well as the many IMVU
employees who did so much of the work I discussed. Of course,
none of that would have been possible without the support of
millions of IMVU customers over the years. I’d also like to thank
David Millstone, Ken Duda, Fernando Paiz, Steve Weinstein, Owen
Mahoney, Ray Ocampo, and Jason Altieri for their help along the
way.We all owe Steve Blank a debt for the work he did developing

the theory of customer development at a time when it was
considered heretical in startup and VC circles. As I mentioned in the
Introduction, Steve was an early investor in and adviser to IMVU.
For the past seven years, he has been an adviser, mentor, and
collaborator to me personally. I want to thank him for his
encouragement, support, and friendship.
The Lean Startup movement is made up of many more thinkers,
practitioners, and writers than just me. I want to thank Dave
McClure, Ash Maurya, Brant Cooper, Patrick Vlaskovits, Sean Ellis,
Andrew Chen, Sean Murphy, Trevor Owens, Hiten Shah, and Kent
Beck for their ideas, support, and evangelism. Several investors and
venture capitalists were early supporters and adopters. I would like
to thank Mike Maples and Ann Miura-Ko (Floodgate), Steve
Anderson (Baseline), Josh Kopelman (First Round Capital), Ron
Conway (SV Angel), and Jeff Clavier (SoftTech VC).
As you can imagine, this book involved a tremendous amount of
feedback, iteration, and testing. I received invaluable, in-depth early
feedback from Laura Crescimano, Lee Ho�man, Professor Tom
Eisenmann, and Sacha Judd. Thanks also to Mitch Kapor, Scott
Cook, Shawn Fanning, Mark Graban, Jennifer Carolan, Manuel
Rosso, Tim O’Reilly, and Reid Ho�man for their suggestions,
feedback, and support. I owe a special note of thanks to Ruth
Kaplan and Ira Fay for their wisdom and friendship.
Throughout the process of writing the book, I had the bene�t of a
custom-built testing platform to run split-test experiments on
everything from cover design to subtitles to actual bits of the book
(you can see the results of these experiments at http://lean.st).
Pivotal Labs built this software for me; they are the premier
practitioners of agile development. Special thanks to Rob Mee, Ian
McFarland, and—most important—Parker Thompson, who worked
tirelessly to build, experiment, and learn with me.
Thanks also to IMVU cofounder Marcus Gosling, one of the most
talented designers I know, who designed this book’s cover, after
countless iterations.
One of the premier web and user experience design �rms, Digital
Telepathy, designed and built the website for

I was extremely fortunate to have the support of three legendary
institutions at various points in my journey. Much of the research
that went into this book was generously underwritten by the
Kau�man Foundation. At Kau�man, I want to especially thank Bo
Fishback and Nick Seguin for their support. I spent the past year as
an entrepreneur-in-residence at Harvard Business School, where I
enjoyed the opportunity to test my ideas against some of the
brightest minds in business. I am especially grateful to Professors
Tom Eisenmann and Mike Roberts for their sponsorship and
support, as well as to the students of the HBS Startup Tribe. I also
had the opportunity to spend a brief time with an o�ce at the
premier venture capital �rm in Silicon Valley, Kleiner Perkins
Cau�eld & Byers, where I received an in-depth education into how
entrepreneurship is nurtured at the highest levels. Thanks to ChiHua Chien, Randy Komisar, Matt Murphy, Bing Gordon, Aileen Lee,
and Ellen Pao, and to my officemate and EIR, Cyriac Roeding.
My research team helped me document case studies, interview
hundreds of startups, and �lter thousands of stories. I want to thank
Marisa Porzig, who logged countless hours documenting, crossreferencing, and investigating. Additional case studies were
developed by Sara Gaviser Leslie and Sarah Milstein.
Traditional publishing is a complicated and insular business. I
bene�ted from advice and connections from many people. Tim
Ferriss and Ramit Sethi set me straight early on. I am also grateful
to Peter Sims, Paul Michelman, Mary Treseler, Joshua-Michéle Ross,
Clara Shih, Sarah Milstein, Adam Penenberg, Gretchen Rubin, Kate
Lee, Hollis Heimbouch, Bob Sutton, Frankie Jones, Randy Komisar,
and Jeff Rosenthal.
At Crown, the herculean task of turning this idea into the book
you are reading fell to a huge team of people. My editor, Roger
Scholl, saw the vision of this book from the very beginning and
shepherded it through the entire process. I want to also thank Tina
Constable, Tara Gilbride, and Meredith McGinnis and everyone else

who worked on making this book a reality.
Those who had the misfortune of reading an early draft know just
how much gratitude I owe to Laureen Rowland, who provided
essential editorial help on an unbelievably tight schedule. If you
enjoyed any part of this book, she deserves your thanks.
My adviser, partner, and consigliere throughout the publishing
process has been my phenomenal agent, Christy Fletcher. She has
the uncanny ability to predict the future, make things happen, and
keep every stakeholder happy—all at the same time. She truly
understands the modern media landscape and has helped me
navigate its crazy waters at every turn. At Fletcher and Company, I
also want to thank Alyssa Wol�, who has been a tireless advocate
and gatekeeper, and Melissa Chinchillo, who is working to bring
this book to new regions and languages.
I know it is a cliché to say, “None of this would have been
possible without the constant support of my loving family.” But in
this case, it is simply the truth. My parents, Vivian Reznik and
Andrew Ries, have always supported my love of technology while
still insisting on the importance of a liberal arts education. Without
their constant love and support, I would never have had the
courage to step into the void of entrepreneurship or have found my
own voice as a writer. I know my grandparents have been with me
every step of this journey—they believed deeply in the power of
writing and took supreme joy in my sisters’ and my every
accomplishment. To my sisters Nicole and Amanda and my brotherin-law Dov, I can only say: thank you for supporting me all these

years.
My wife, Tara Sophia Mohr, has been a constant source of joy
and comfort every step of the way. She has experienced every stress,
every high, and every low through this very lengthy process. Tara,
you are an incredibly brilliant, strong, and compassionate woman.
Words cannot express how much I appreciate your steadfast
support, your overwhelming love, and the daily adventure that is
our life together. Thank you.
