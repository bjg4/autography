back for rewrites or with a
complimentary note. I do this with
as much noise and visibility as I
can, because I want to reiterate and
reaffirm the significance the system
has and should have for every Intel
employee* Anything less would not
be appropriate for the most
important kind of task-relevant
feedback we can give our
subordinates.

Two Difficult Tasks


There are two other emotionally
charged tasks a manager must
perform. They are interviewing a
potential employee and trying to
talk a valued employee out of
quitting.


Interviewing


The purpose of the interview is to:


- select a good performer


- educate him as to who you and the


company are


- determine if a mutual match

exists


- sell him on the job


The means at your disposal
typically consist of an hour or two
of interview time and a check of the

candidate's references. We know

how hard it is to assess the actual
past performance of our own
subordinates even though we spent
much time working closely with
them. Here we sit somebody down
and try to find out in an hour how
well he is likely to perform in an


entirely new environment. If
performance appraisal is difficult,
interviewing is just about
impossible. The fact is, we
managers have no choice but to
perform the interview, no matter
how


hard it is. But we must realize that
the risks of failure are high.


J^ 16 other to ° l we have for
assessing potential performance is
to research past performance bv
cherkina references. But you'll
often be talking to a total stranger,
so even if he comments freely about
the candidate, what he says won't


have much meaning to you without
some knowledge of how his
company does business and what
values it works by. Moreover, while
few references will out-and-out lie,
they tend not to volunteer specific
critical remarks. So referencechecking hardly exempts you from
getting as much as you can out of
the interview.


CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW


The applicant should do 80 percent
of the talking durintr the interview,
and what he talks about should be
your main concern. But you have a
great deal of control here by being


an active listener. Keep in mind you
only have an hour or so to listen.
When you ask a question, a
garrulous or nervous person might
go on and on with his answer long
after you've lost interest. Most of us
will sit and listen until the end out
of courtesv. Instead, vou should
interrupt and stop him, because if
you don't, you are wasting your only
asset—the interview time, in which
you have to get as much
information and insight as possiDie. bo when things go off the track,
get them back on quickly. Apologize
if you like, and sav, "I would like to
change the subject to X, Y, or Z."


The interview is yours to control,
and if you don't, you have only
yourself to blame.


An interview produces the most
insight if you steer the discussion
toward subjects familiar to both you
and the candidate. The person
should talk about himself, his
experience, what he has done and
whv. what hp woulH have done
differently if he had it to do over,
and so forth but this should be done
in terms familiar to you, so that


you can evaluate its significance. In
short, make sure the words used
mean the same thing to both of you.


What are the subjects that you
should bring up during an
interview? A group of managers
provided me with what they
thought were the best questions.
They were:


— Describe some projects that were
highly regarded by your
management, especially by the
levels above your immediate
supervisor.


— What are your weaknesses? How
are you working to eliminate them?


— Convince me why my company
should hire you.


— What are some of the problems
you are encountering in your
current position? How are you
going about solving them? What
could you have done to prevent
them from cropping up?


— Why do you think you're ready
for this new job?


— What do you consider your most
significant achievements? Why
were they important to you?


— What do you consider your most
significant failures? What did you
leam from them?


— Why do you think an engineer
should be chosen for a marketing
position? (Vary this one according
to the situation.)


— What was the most important
course or project you completed in
your college career? Why was it so
important?


The information to be gained here
tends to fall into four distinct
categories. First, you're after an
understanding of the candidate's
technical knowledge: not
engineering or scientific knowledge,
but what he knows about
performing the job he wants—his


skill level. For an accountant,
technical skill means an
understanding of accounting; for a
tax lawyer, tax laws; for an actuary,
statistics and the use of actuarial
tables; and so on. Second, you're
trying to assess how this person
performed in an earlier job using
his skills and technical knowledge;


in short, not just what the candidate
knows, but also what he did with
what he knows. Third, you are after
the reasons why there may be any
discrepancy between what he knew
and what he did, between his
capabilities and his performance.
And finally, you are trying to get a


feel for his set of operational
values, those that would guide him
on the job.


Let's look at how the questions
above fit into the four categories.


Technical/'Skills describe some
projects what are your weaknesses


What He Did With Knowledge past
achievements past failures


Discrepancies


what did you learn from failures


problems in current position


Operational Values


why are you ready for new job


why should my company hire you


why should engineer be chosen for
marketing


most important college
course/project


The ultimate purpose of
interviewing is to make a judgment
about how the candidate would
perform in your company's
environment. This is at odds with a
principle we stressed about


performance reviews: the need to
avoid the "potential" trap. But when
you're hiring, you must judge
potential contribution. Within the
hour or so at your disposal, you
must move between the world of
the past employer and your own,
and project the candidate's future
performance in a new environment
based


on his own description of past
performance. This managerial task
is clearly tricky and high-risk, but
unfortunately unavoidable.


You can't get away from relying on a
candidate's self-assessment. But


that's not a bad way to get direct
answers to direct questions. If, for
example, you were to ask, "How
good are you technically?" the
interviewee might be taken back
momentarily but then clear his
throat and say timidly, "Well, I
think I'm pretty good ..." As you
listen, you'll probably get a decent
fix on how capable he really is.
Don't worry about being blunt;
direct questions tend to bring direct
answers, and when they don't, they
produce other forms of insight into
the candidate.


Asking a candidate to handle a
hypothetical situation can also


enlighten you. I once interviewed
someone for the position of cost
accountant at Intel. He had a

Harvard MBA and came from the
food service industry. He knew
nothing about the semiconductor
business and I knew nothing about
finance, so we really couldn't talk in
much detail about his technical
ability to do the job. I decided to
take him through the
semiconductor manufacturing
process step by step. After saying I
would answer any specific
questions he had, I asked him what
the finished cost of a wafer would
be. He asked some questions and


pondered matters for a while. He
then started to think his way
through the basic semiconductor
cost accounting principles,
discovering some of them as he
went along, and ultimately came up
with the correct answer. He was
hired, because this exercise
demonstrated (as it turns out,
correctly) that his problem-solving
capacity was first-rate.


Another approach follows that you
may want to use while interviewing.
The candidate can tell you a great
deal about his capabilities, skills,
and values by asking you questions.
Ask the candidate what he would


like to know


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


about you, the company, or the job.
The questions he asks will tell you
what he already knows about the
company, what he would like to
know more about, and how well
prepared he is for the interview.
There's nothing foolproof about
this, however. Once a prospective
man" ager came to my omce with a
copy of our annual report, which he
had read very carefully and marked
up with penetrating questions. In
fact, I couldn't answer many of
them. I was very impressed. We


hired him and he failed badly on the
job. As I said, interviewing is a highrisk proposition . . .


A final point about references:
when you are talking to them,
you're really after the same
information that you tried to get
directly from the candidate. If you
know the reference personally, you
have a much better chance of
getting "real" information. If you
don't, try to keep him on the phone
long enough to let some sort of
personal bond develop. If you can
uncover some common experience
or association, the reference will
probably become more open with


you. In my experience, the last ten
minutes of a half-hour conversation

are much more valuable than the
first ten minutes, thanks to that
bond.


If possible, you should talk with the
applicant again after you have
checked his references, because you
may have gotten some new
perspectives. Such a follow-up
interview can be quite a focused
affair.


What about "tricks"? The best ones

I've heard about come to me from
somebody who had tried to get into
the Navy's nuclear submarine


program. Admiral Rickover
apparendy personally interviewed
each candidate and employed
techniques like having the
candidate sit on a three-legged
chair. When it tipped over, the poor
man would be left sprawling on the
floor. Rickover evidently thought
the trick tested strength of
character in the face of

embarrassment. But I think the
interview should be completely
straightforward. Remember, a
candidate is a potential employee.
He will go away from having talked


to you with a strong set of first
impressions. If those are wrong and


you hire the person, it will take a
long time before they change. So
show yourself and your
environment as they really are.


Are there any guarantees of
success? Several years ago I
interviewed a person for a highlevel position at Intel. I did the
work as carefully and thoroughly as
I could. 1 had a very good feel, I
thought, of the whys and
wherefores of the person's skills,
past performance, and values, and
we hired him. From day one he was
a disaster. Much humbled, I've
since gone over my notes from the
interviews and the conversations


with references. To this day I
haven't a clue about why I didn't
spot the candidate's considerable
flaws. So in the end careful
interviewing doesn't guarantee you
anything, it merely increases your
odds of getting lucky.


*7 Quit!"


This is what I most dread as a
manager: a subordinate, highly
valued and esteemed, decides to
quit. I am talking not about
someone whose motives are more
money and better perks at another
company, but about an employee
who is dedicated and loyal yet feels


his work is not appreciated. You and
the company don't want to lose
him, and his decision to leave
reflects on you. If he feels his
efforts have gone unrecognized, you
have not done your job and have
failed as his manager.


The opening shot usually occurs
when you are on the run. On your
way to what you consider an
important meeting, your
subordinate timidly stops you and
mutters under his breath, "Do you
have a minute?" He then mutters

further that he has decided to leave
the company. You look at him wideeyed. Your initial reaction to his


announcement is absolutely crucial.
If you're human, you'll probably
want to escape to your meeting, and
you mumble something back about
talking things over later. But


in almost all such cases, the
employee is quitting because he
feels he is not important to you. If
you do not deal with the situation
right at the first mention, you'll
confirm his feelings and the
outcome is inevitable.


Drop what you are doing. Sit him
down and ask him why he is
quitting. Let him talk—don't argue
about anything with him. Believe


me, he's rehearsed his speech
countless times during more than
one sleepless night. After he's
finished going through all his
reasons for wanting to leave (they
won't be good ones), ask him more
questions. Make him talk, because
after the prepared points are
delivered, the real issues may come
out. Don't argue, don't lecture, and
don't panic. Remember, this is only
the opening skirmish, not the war.
And you cannot win the war here—
but you can lose it! You have to
convey to him by what you do that
he is important to you, and you
have to find out what is really


troubling him. Don't try to change
his mind at this point, but buy time.
After he's said all he has to say, ask
for whatever time you feel is
necessary to prepare yourself for
the next round. But know that you
must follow through on whatever
you've committed yourself to do.


What's your next move? Because
you have a major problem, you go
to your supervisor for help and
advice. He no doubt is also on his
way to an important meeting . . .
He, like you, will try to put things
off, and most probably not because
he doesn't care, but because the
situation affects you more than


your supervisor—after all, it is your
subordinate who has decided to
quit. It is up to you to make it your
supervisor's problem and make him
participate in the solution to your
problem.


Corporate citizenship will probably
play a substantial role in what
happens next. Your subordinate is a
valued employee—of the company.
You now must vigorously pursue
every avenue available to you to
keep him with the firm, even if it
means transferring him to another
department. If it seems that is the
likely solution, you


must become the project manager
of that solution until the whole
thing is settled. You may ask why
you should put yourself out to keep
an employee whom you are going to
lose. There is a basic principle
involved: you owe it to your
employer to save an employee for
the company. Beyond this, the
golden rule can become more than
a nice ideal in situations of this
sort. Today you save a valued
contributor for the company by
virtually giving him to a fellow
manager. Tomorrow it will be his
turn to do you the same favor. In
the long run, if all managers take


this position, they will all win.


Nov/ you may be ready to go back
to your subordinate with a solution,
one that addresses his real reasons
for wanting to quit and one that in
turn will benefit the company. By
now he should know that he is
important to you, but he might say
that you should have offered him
the new position long ago. He might
go on to say that you're only doing
it now because he forced you into it
? his feeling being that "If I stay,
you'll think of me as the
blackmailer forever!"


You now have to make him feel


comfortable with the new
arrangement. You might say
something like, "You did not
blackmail us into doing anything we
shouldn't have done anyway. When
you almost quit, you shook us up
and made us aware of the error of
our ways. We are just doing what
we should have done without any of
this happening."


Then your subordinate may say he's
accepted a job somewhere else and
can't back out. You have to make
him quit again. You say he's really
made two commitments: first to a
potential employer he only vaguely
knows, and second to you, his


present employer. And
commitments he has made to the
people he has been working with
daily are far stronger than one
made to a casual new acquaintance.


As I said, the whole thing is not
easy, either for the subordinate or
the supervisor. But you must give it

your


best shot, because the good of the
company is involved and the issue
is even more important than
keeping one valued employee. This
subordinate is valuable and
important because he has attributes
that make him so. Other employees


respect him; and if they are like
him, they identify with him. So
other superior performers like him
will track what happens to him, and
their morale and commitment to
the company will hinge on the
outcome of this person's fate.


Compensation as Task-Relevant
Feedback


Money has significance at all levels
of Maslow's motivation hierarchy.
As noted earlier, a person needs
money to buy food, housing, and
insurance policies, which are part of
his physiological and
safety/security needs. As one moves


up the need hierarchy, money
begins to mean something else—a
measure of one's worth in a
competitive environment. Earlier I
described a simple test that can be
applied to determine the role
money plays for someone. If the
absolute amount of a raise in salary
is important, that person is
probably motivated by physiological
or safety/security needs. If the
relative amount of a raise—what he
got compared to others—is the
important issue, that person is
likely to be motivated by selfactualization, because money here
is a measure, not a necessity.


At higher levels of compensation,
an incremental amount of money
gradually will have less and less
material utility to the person who
gets it. In my experience, middle
managers are usually paid well
enough that money does not have
crucial material significance to
them, but not well enough that it is
without any material significance.
Of course, one middle manager's
needs can differ gready from
another's, depending on individual


circumstances—number of children,
a working spouse or not, and so on.
As a supervisor, you have to be very
sensitive toward the various money


needs of your subordinates and
show empathy toward them. You
must be especially careful not to
project your own circumstances
onto others.


As managers, our concern is to get a
high level of performance from our
subordinates. So we want to
dispense, allocate, and use money
as a way to deliver task-relevant
feedback To do this, compensation
should obviously be tied to
performance, but that, as we've
seen, is very hard to assess
precisely. Because a middle
manager cannot be paid by the
piece, his job can never be defined


by simple output. And because his
performance is woven into the
performance of a team, it is hard to
design a compensation scheme tied
directly to the individual
performance of a middle manager.


But compromises can be set up. We
can base a portion of a middle
manager's compensation on his
performance. Let's call this a
performance bonus. The percentage
the bonus represents of a manager's
total compensation should rise with
his total compensation. Thus, for a
highly paid senior manager, for
whom the absolute dollars make
relatively little difference, the


performance bonus should be as
high as 50 percent, while a middle
manager should receive more in the
range of 10 to 25 percent of his total
compensation this way. Even
though what he makes is typically
at a level where substantial
fluctuations could cause personal
hardship, we can at least give a taste
of task-relevant feedback.


To design a good performance
bonus scheme, we must deal with a
variety of issues. We need to figure
out if the performance is linked to a
team or if it is mostly related to
individual work. If it is the former,
who makes up the team? Is it a


project team, a division, or the
entire corporation? We also need to
figure out what period the
performance bonus should cover,
realizing again that


cause and effect tend to be offset
from each other, often by a long
time, but a bonus needs to be paid
close enough to the time the work
was done that the subordinate can
remember why it was awarded.
Furthermore, we must think about
whether the bonus should be based
strictly on countable items
(financial performance, for
example), on achieving measurable
objectives, or on some subjective


elements that might get us drawn
into a beauty contest. Finally, of
course, we don't want to devise
something that pays out lavishly
even as the company is going
bankrupt.


If you take all of this into account,
you are likely to come up with some
complex arrangements. For
example, you might have a scheme
in which a manager's performance
bonus is based on three factors. The

first would include his individual
performance only, as judged by his
supervisor. The second would
account for his immediate team's
objective performance, his


department perhaps. The third
factor would be linked to the overall
financial performance of the
corporation. When you take, let's
say, 20 percent of a manager's
compensation and split it into three
parts, any one will have only a small
impact on total compensation, yet
attention will still be called to its
significance. No matter what way
you choose to determine bonuses,
none gives you exactly what you
want, but most of them will
spotlight performance and deliver
task-relevant feedback.


Let's now look at the administration
of base salaries. In the abstract,


there are two ways to do it. At one
extreme, the dollar level is
determined by experience only; at
the other, by merit alone. In the
experience-only approach, an
employee's salary increases with
the time he has spent in a particular
position. A key point here is that
any job has a maximum value; no
matter how long an individual has
been in it, his salary ultimately has
to level off, as shown in the figure
on the next page. In the merit-only
approach, salary is independent of
the time


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


spent in the job. Here the theory
says, "I don't care if you are one
year out of college or have spent
twenty years in the work force. I
only care to see how you perform in
this


Maximum


Performance


Time A. Experience only


Time B. Merit only


Time C. Compromise


There are two pure forms of salary
administration; most companies
use a compromise.


job." But here too, of course, a given
job still has a maximum value.
Social norms can force us into some
unfortunate compensation
practices. For instance, even though
we say that every job has a finite
value where compensation should
level off, we often let an individual


become too highly paid because we,
management, keep giving routine
raises.


Many organizations practice a pure
experience-only form of salary
administration. Large Japanese
companies tend to place no
distinction based on performance
during the first ten or so years of
employment—which are probably
the most productive years of a
professional's life. Likewise, unions
and most government jobs lean
toward pure experience-only salary
scales. Apart from whether this is
fair or not, the message frorn
management is that performance


doesn't matter much. Consider
teachers in many school systems. A
good one gets paid the same salary
as a bad one if they both have been
around for the same length of time.
How a teacher is


evaluated is not usually tied even
symbolically to compensation,
which makes me wonder if the
pass/fail system of grading did not
have its origin in the way the typical
teacher is paid.


At the same time, merit-only salary
administration is impractical in its
pure form. It is very hard to ignore
a person's experience as you try to


pay a fair salary. Thus, most
companies choose a course between
the two extremes, which is a
compromise scheme that takes the
shape of a family of curves shown
in the previous figure. The shapes
of all of them approximate the
curve representing the experienceonly approach, but as you can see,
while people start at the same
salary level, they move up at
different speeds and arrive at
different places, depending upon
individual performance.


Of the three schemes, the one based
on experience only is obviously the
easiest to administer. If your


subordinate does not like the raise
he's been given, all you have to do is
show him the book where it says
that for X amount of time on the
job he deserves and gets Y amount
of pay. A supervisor trying to
administer some type of meritbased or compromise scheme has to
deal with the allocation of a finite
resource—money—and this requires
thought and effort. If we want to
use such schemes, we have to come
to terms with the principle—
troubling to many managers—that
any merit-based system requires a
competitive, comparative
evaluation of individuals.


Merit-based compensation simply
cannot work unless we understand
that if someone is going to be first,
somebody else has to be last. As
Americans, we have no problem
accepting a competitive ranking in a
sports event. Even the person who
comes in last in a race feels
comfortable about the system that
says someone has to finish last. But
at work, unfortunately, competitive
ranking frequently becomes a
highly charged issue, difficult to
accept and to administer—yet it is a
must if


we want to use salary as a way to
encourage performance.


Promotions, denned as a
substantial change in a person's job,
are very important to the health of
any organization and should be
considered with great care.
Obviously, for the individual
concerned, promotions often
produce a big raise. As we have
seen, promotions are also readily
seen by other members of the
organization, and so take on a
vitally important role in
communicating a value system to
the rest of the company.
Promotions must be based on
performance, because that is the
only way to keep the idea of


performance highlighted,
maintained, and perpetuated.


If we are going to consider
promotions, we have to consider
the Peter Principle, which says that
when someone is good at his job, he
is promoted; he keeps getting
promoted until he reaches his level
of incompetence and then stays
there. Like all good caricatures, this
one captures at least some of what
really happens in a merit-based
promotion system.


Take a look at the illustration
opposite, where we track someone's
promotions. At point A the


demands of Job i so tax him that he
can only perform in an average
fashion. In the jargon of
performance assessment, he "meets
the requirements" of the job. As
time passes, he receives more
training and becomes more
motivated, and improves his
performance to an above-average
level, or, again in the jargon, to a
point where he "exceeds the
requirements" of the position. At
this time we consider the person
promotable, and in fact do promote
him to Job 2, where he will at first
perform only at a "meets
requirements" level. With more


experience, he again will"exceed the
requirements" of thejob.
Eventually, he probably gets
promoted again and the cycle
repeats itself. Thus, an achiever will
alternate between the "meets
requirements" and the "exceeds
requirements" ratings throughout
his career, until he eventually
settles at°a

his career.


"meets requirements" level, at
which time he will no longer be
promoted. This, perhaps, is a better
description of how the Peter
Principle works.


Now, is there an alternative to this?


I say there is not. If we take a
person at point B and don't offer
him more work and greater
challenges even though he "exceeds
the requirements" of Job 1, we are
not fully utilizing a human resource
of the company. In time, he will
atrophy, and his performance will
return to a "meets requirements"
level and stay there.


Thus, you'll find two basic types of
"meets" performers. One has no
motivation to do more or faces no
challenge to do more. This is the
noncompetitor, who has become
settled and satisfied in his job. The
other type of "meets" performer is


the competitor. Each time he
reaches a level of "exceeds
requirements," he becomes a
candidate for promotion. Upon
being promoted, he very likely
becomes a "meets" performer again.
This is the person Dr. Peter wrote
about. But we really have no


choice but to promote until a level
of "incompetence" is reached. At
least this way we drive our
subordinates toward higher
performance, and while they may
perform at a "meets" level half the
time, they will do that at an
increasingly more challenging and
difficult job level-There are times


when a person is promoted into a
position so much over his head that
he performs in a below-average
fashion for too long a time. The
solution is to recycle him: to put
him back into the job he did well
before he was promoted.
Unfortunately, this is a very
difficult thing to do in our society.
People tend to view it as a personal
failure. In fact, management was at
fault for misjudging the employee's
readiness for more responsibility.
Usually the person who was
promoted beyond his capability is
forced to leave the company rather
than encouraged to take a step back.


This is often rationalized by the
notion that "It is better that we let
him go, for his own sake." I think it
is dead wrong to force someone in
such circumstances out of the
company. Instead, I think
management ought to face up to its
own error in judgment and take
forthright and deliberate steps to
place the person into a job he can
do. Management should also
support the employee in the face of
the embarrassment that he is likely
to feel. If recycling is done openly,
all will be pleasantly surprised how
short-lived that embarrassment will
be. And the result will be a person


doing work we know from past
experience he can perform well. In
my experience, such people, once
they regain their confidence, will be
excellent candidates for another
promotion at a later time—and the
second time they are likely to
succeed.


In sum, we managers must be
responsible and provide our
subordinates with honest
performance ratings and honest
merit-based compensation. If we
do, the eventual result will be
performance valued for its own
sake throughout our organization.
