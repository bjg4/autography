Note how the change follows the
pattern we outlined and analyzed.
As the company grew and its
product line broadened, the number
of things it had to keep track of
multiplied. It made more and more
sense to create an organization
serving each product line; hence the
three product divisions. But as the
news release indicates, the major
functional organizations of ABC
Technologies, such as sales and
manufacturing, will remain
centralized and will serve the three
mission-oriented organizations.


Here I would like to propose
Grove's Law: All large organizations


with a common business purpose
end up in a hybrid organizational
form.


The Breakfast Factory, an army,
Intel, and ABC Technologies
provide examples. But just about
ebery large company or enterprise
that I know is organized in a hybrid
form. Take an educational

institution in which one finds

individual mission-oriented
departments such as mathematics,
English, engineering, and so on, and
also administration, composed of
personnel, security, and library
services, whose combined task is to
supply the common resources that


each of the individual departments
needs to function.


Another very different example of
the hybrid form can be found in the
national Junior Achievement
organization. Here each individual
chapter runs its own business, with
each deciding what product to sell,
actually selling


it, and otherwise maintaining all
aspects of the business.
Nevertheless, the national
organization controls the way the
chapters are to go about their own
pursuits: the form in which the
individual businesses are to be


structured, the paperwork
requirements, and the rewards for
successful operation.


The use of the hybrid organizational
form does not even necessarily
depend on how large a business or
activity is. A friend of mine is a
lawyer in a medium-size law firm.
He told me how his firm tried to
deal with the problems and
conflicts he and his colleagues were
having over resources they all
shared, such as the steno pool and
office space. They ended up forming
an executive committee that would
not interfere with the legal
(mission-oriented) work of the


individual attorneys but would
address the acquisition and
allocation of common, shared
resources. Here is a small operation
finding itself with the hybrid
organizational form.


Do any exceptions exist to the
universality of hybrid
organizations? The only exceptions
that come to my mind are
conglomerates, which are typically
organized in a totally missionoriented form. Why are they an
exception to our rule? Because they
do not have a common business
purpose. The various divisions (or
companies) in this case are all


independent and bear no
relationship to one another beyond
the conglomerate profit and loss
statement. But within each
business unit of the conglomerate,
the organization is likely to be
structured along the hybrid line.


Of course, each hybrid organization
is unique because a limitless
number of points lie between the
hypothetical extremes of the totally
functional and the totally missionoriented forms. In fact, a single
organization may very well shift
back and forth between the two
poles, movement that should be
brought on by pragmatic


considerations. For example, a
company with an inadequate
computer acquires a large, powerful
new one, making


possible centralized economies of
scale. Conversely, a company
replaces a large computer with
small inexpensive ones that can be
readily installed in various missionoriented units without loss of the
economies of scale. This is how 7 a
business can adapt. But the most
important consideration should be
this: the shift back and forth
between the two types of
organizations can and should be
initiated to match the operational


styles and aptitudes of the
managers ninning the individual
units.


As I've said, sooner or later all
reasonably large companies must
cope with the problems inherent in
the workings of a hybrid
organization. The most important
task before such an organization is
the optimum and timely allocation
of its resources and the efficient
resolution of conflicts arising over
that allocation.


Though this problem may be very
complex, "allocators'' working out
of some central office are certainly


not the answer. In fact, the most
glaring example of inefficiency Fve
encountered went on some years
ago in Hun-gar/, where I once lived
and where a central planning
organization decided what goods
were to be produced, when, and
where. The rationale for such
planning v/as very solid, but in
practice it usually fell far, far short
of meeting real consumer needs. In
Hungary I was an amateur
photographer. During the winter,
when I needed high-contrast film,
none was to be found anywhere. Yet
during the summer, everyone was
up to his waist in the stuff, even


though regular film was in short
supply. Year after year, decisionmaking in the central planning
organization was so clumsy that it
could not even respond to totally
predictable changes in demand. In
our business culture, the allocation
of shared resources and the
reconciliation of the conflicting
needs and desires of the
independent business units are
theoretically the function of
corporate management. Practically,
however, the transaction load is far
too heavy to be handled in one
place. If we at Intel tried to resolve
all conflicts and allocate all


resources at the top, we would
begin to resemble the group that
ran the Hungarian economy.


Instead, the answer lies with middle
managers. Within a company, they
are, in the first place, numerous
enough to cover the entire range of
operation; and, in the second place,
very close to the problem we're
talking about— namely, generating
internal resources and consuming
those resources. For middle
managers to succeed at this highleverage task, two things are
necessary. First, they must accept
the inevitability of the hybrid
organizational form if they are to


serve its workings. Second, they
must develop and master the
practice through which a hybrid
organization can be managed. This
is dual reporting, the subject of our
next chapter.

Dual Reporting


To put a man on the moon, NASA
asked several major contractors and
many subcontractors to work
together, each on a different aspect
of the project. An unintended


consequence of the moon shot was
the development of a new
organizational approach: matrix
management This provided the
means through which the work of
various contractors could be
coordinated and managed so that if
problems developed in one place,
they did not subvert the entire
schedule. Resources could be
diverted, for example, from a strong
organization to one that was
slipping in order to help the latter
make up lost time. Matrix
management is a complicated affair.
Books have been written about it

and entire courses of instruction


devoted to it. But the core idea was
that a project manager, somebody
outside any of the contractors
involved, could wield as much
influence on the work of units
within a given company as could
the company management itself.
Thus, NASA elaborated the
principle of dual reporting on a
grand scale. In reality, the basic idea
had been quietly at work for many
years, enabling hybrid organizations
of all types to function, from the
neighborhood high school to Alfred
Sloan's General Motors—not to
mention the Breakfast Factory


franchises. Let's re-create how Intel


came to adopt a dual reporting
system.


Where Should Plant Security
Report?


When our company was young and
small, we stumbled onto dual
reporting almost by accident. At a
staff meeting we were trying to
decide to whom the security
personnel at our new outlying
plants should report. We had two
choices. One would have the
employees report to the plant
manager. But a plant manager, by
background, is typically an engineer
or a manufacturing person who


knows very little about security
issues and cares even less. The

other choice would have them
report to the security manager at
the main plant. He hired them in
the first place, and he isjhe expert
who sets the standards that the
security officers are supposed to
adhere to throughout the company.
And it was clear that security
procedures and practices at the
outlying plants had to conform to
some kind of corporate standard.


I here was only one problem with
the latter arrangement. The security
manager works at corporate
headquarters and not at the


outlying plant, so how would he
know if the security personnel
outside the main plant even showed
up, or came in late, or
otherwise'per-rormed badly? He
wouldn't. After we wrestled with the
dilemma for a while, it occurred to
us that perhaps security personnel
should report jointly to the
corporate security manager and to
the local plant manager. The hrst
would specify how the job ought to
be done, and the second would
monitor how it was being
performed day by day.


While the arrangement seemed to
solve both problems, the staff


couldn't quite accept it. We found
ourselves asking, "A person has to
have a boss, so who is in charge
here?" Could an employee in fact
have two bosses? ine answer was a
tentative "yes," and the cul

tore of joint reporting relationships,
dual reporting, was born. It was a
slow, laborious birth.


But the need for dual reporting is
actually quite fundamental. Let's
think for a minute about how a
manager comes to be. The first step
in his career is being an individual
contributor—a salesman, for
instance. If he proves himself a


superior salesman, he is promoted
to the position of sales manager,
where he supervises people in his
functional specialty, sales. When he
has shown himself to be a superstar
sales manager he is promoted
again, this time becoming a regional
sales manager. If he works at Intel,
he is now not only supervising
salesmen but also so-called field
application engineers, who
obviously know more about
technical matters than he does but
whom he still manages. The
promotions continue until our
superstar finds himself a general
manager of a business division

Among other things, our new
general manager has no experience
with manufacturing. So while he is
perfectly capable of supervising his
manufacturing manager in the
more general aspects of his job, the
new boss has no choice but to leave
the technical aspects to his
subordinate, because as a graduate
of sales, he has absolutely no
background in manufacturing. In
other divisions of the corporation,
manufacturing managers may
similarly be reporting to people who
rose through the ranks of
engineering and finance.


We could handle the problem by


designating one person the senior
manufacturing manager and having
all the manufacturing managers
report to him instead of to the
general manager. But the more we
do this, the more we move toward a
totally functional form of
organization. A general manager
could no longer coordinate the
activities of the finance, marketing,
engineering, and manufacturing
groups toward a single business
purpose responsive to marketplace
needs. We want the immediacy and
the operating priorities coming
from the general man

ager as well as a technical


supervisory relationship. The
solution is dual reporting.


But does the technical supervisor's
role have to be filled by a single
individual? No. Consider the
following scenario, which could be
taken from an ordinary day at Intel.
Our manufacturing manager is
sitting in the cafeteria having a cup
of coffee, and the manufacturing
manager from another division
(whose boss, the general manager,
has a finance background) comes
over. They start chatting about
what's going on in their respective
divisions and begin to realize that
they have a number of technical


problems in common. Applying the
theory that two heads are better
than one, they decide to meet a bit
more often. Eventually the
meetings become regularly
scheduled and manufacturing
managers from other divisions join
the two to exchange views about
problems they share. Pretty soon a
committee or a council made up of
a group of peers comes into
existence to tackle issues common
to all. In short, they have found a
way to deal with those technical
issues that their bosses, the general
managers, can't help them with. In
effect, they now have supervision


that a general manager competent
in manufacturing could have given
them, but that supervision is being
exercised by a peer group. The
manufacturing managers report to
two supervisors: to this group and
to their respective general
managers, as the figure opposite
shows.


To make such a body work requires
the voluntary surrender of
individual decision-making to the
group. Being a member means you
no longer have compfete freedom of
individual action, because you must
go along with the decisions of your
peers in most instances. By analogy,


think of yourself as one of a couple
who decides to take a vacation with
another couple. You know that if
you go together you will not be free
to do exacdy what you want to do
when you want to do it, but you go
together anyway because you'll
have more fun, even while you'll
have less

freedom. At work, surrendering
individual decisionmaking depends
on trusting the soundness of
actions taken by your group of

peers.


Trust in no way relates to an
organizational principle but is
instead an aspect of the corporate
culture, something about which
much has been written in recent
years. Put simply, it is a set of
values and beliefs, as well as
familiarity with the way things are


done and should be done in a
company. The point is that a strong
and positive corporate culture is
absolutely essential if dual
reporting and decision-making by
peers are to work.


This system makes a manager's life
ambiguous, and most people don't
like ambiguity. Nevertheless, the
system is needed to make hybrid
organizations work, and while
people will strive to find something
simpler, the reality is that it doesn't
exist. A strictly functional
organization, which is clear
conceptually, tends to remove
engineering and manufacturing (or


the equivalent groups in your firm)
from the marketplace, leaving them
with no idea of what the customers
want. A highly mission-oriented
organization, in turn, may have
definite crisp re

porting relationships and clear and
unambiguous objectives at all
times. However, the fragmented
state of affairs that results causes
inefficiency and poor overall
performance.


It's not because Intel loved
ambiguity that we became a hybrid
organization. We have tried
everything else, and while other


models may have been less
ambiguous, they simply didn't
work. Hybrid organizations and the
accompanying dual reporting
principle, like a democracy, are not
great in and of themselves. They
just happen to be the best way for
any business to be organized.


Making Hybrid Organizations Work


To make hybrid organizations work,
you need a way to coordinate the
mission-oriented units and the
functional groups so that the
resources of the latter are allocated

and delivered to meet the needs of

the former. Consider how the


controller works at Intel. His
professional methods, practices,
and standards are set by the
functional group to which he
belongs, the finance organization.
Consequently, the controller for a
business unit should report to
someone in both the functional and
the mission-oriented organizations,
with the type of supervision
reflecting the varying needs of the
two. The divisional general manager
gives the controller missionoriented priorities by asking him to
work on specific business problems.
The finance manager makes sure
that the controller is trained to do


his work in a technically proficient
manner, supervises and monitors
his technical performance, and
looks after his career inside finance,
promoting him, perhaps, to the
position of controller of a bigger,
more complex division if he
performs well. Again, as shown
opposite, this is dual reporting, the
management principle that enables
the hybrid organization form to
work.


The example has parallels
throughout a corporation.

The controller for a business
division should be supervised by
both organizations.


Consider advertising. Should each
business division devise and pursue
its own advertising campaign, or
should all of it be handled through
a single corporate entity? As before,
there are pros and cons on both
sides. Each division clearly
understands its own strategy best,
and therefore presumably best
understands what its advertising
message should be and to whom it
should be aimed. This would


suggest that advertising stay in the
hands of the divisions. On the other
hand, the products of various
divisions often all serve the needs
of a specific market, and taken
together represent a much more
complete solution to the customers'
needs than what can be provided by
an individual division. Here the

customer and hence the
manufacturer clearly benefit if all
the advertising stories are told in a
coherent, coordinated fashion. Also,
advertising sells not just a specific
product but the entire corporation
as well. Because the ads ought to
project a consistent image that is


right for everybody, we


should at the very least not let a
division go out and hire its own
advertising agency.


As with much else in a hybrid
organization, the optimum solution
here calls for the use of dual
reporting. The divisional marketing
managers should control most of
their own advertising messages. But
a coordinating body of peers
consisting of the various divisional
marketing managers and perhaps
chaired by the corporate
merchandising manager should
provide the necessary functional


supervision for all involved. This
body would choose the advertising
agency, for instance, and determine
the graphic image to which all
divisional ads should conform. It
could also define the way the
division marketing managers would
deal with the agency, which could
reduce the cost of space through the
use of volume buying. Yet the
specific selling message
communicated by an individual ad
would be mainly left to the
divisional people.


Dual reporting can certainly tax the
patience of the marketing
managers, as they are now also


required to understand the needs
and thought processes of their
peers. But no real alternative exists
when you need to communicate
individual product and market
messages and maintain a corporate
identity at the same time.


We have seen that all kinds of
organizations evolve into a hybrid
organizational form. They must also
develop a system of dual reporting.
Consider the following story about
Ohio University that appeared in
the Wall Street Journal (bracketed
comments are mine):


A university is an odd place to


manage. The president of the
University said, "There's clearly a
shared responsibility for decisionmaking between administration

[functional organization] and
faculty [mission-oriented
organization]." A University
Planning Advisory Council [a group
of peers] was formed with
representation from the faculty and
administra

tion to help allocate limited
resources [a most difficult and
common problem] in the face of
severe budget cuts, "We are being
educated to think institutionally,"
said one council member. "I'm


representing student affairs, which
had some projects up for
consideration this year. But I made
a big pitch for buying a new
bulldozer."


So to put it yet another way, the
hybrid organizational form is the
inevitable consequence of enjoying
the benefits of being part of a large
organization—a company or
university or whatever. To be sure,
neither that form nor the need for
dual reporting is an excuse for
needless busywork, and we should
mercilessly slash away unnecessary
bureaucratic hindrance, apply work
simplification to all we do, and


continually subject all established
requirements for coordination and
consultation to the test of common
sense. But we should not expect to
escape from complexity by playing
with reporting arrangements. Like
it or not. the hybrid organization is
a fundamental phenomenon of
organizational life.


Another Wrinkle: The Two-Plane
Organization


Whenever a person becomes
involved in coordination—
something not part of his regular
daily work—we encounter a subtle
variation of dual reporting.


Remember Cindy, the know-how
manager responsible for
maintaining and improving a
specific manufacturing process?
Cindy reports to a supervising
engineer, who in turn reports to the
engineering manager of the plant.
In her daily work, Cindy keeps
things going by manipulating the
manufacturing equipment,
watching the process monitors, and
making adjustments when
necessary. But Cindy has another
job, too. She meets formally once a
month with her counterparts from
the other production plants to
identify, discuss, and solve


problems related to


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


the process for which they are each
responsible in their respective
plants. This coordinating group also
works to standardize procedures
used at all plants. The work of
Cindy's group, and others like it, is
supervised by another more senior
group (called the Engineering
Managers Council), which is made
up of the engineering managers
from all the plants.


Cindy's various reporting
relationships can be found in the


figure below. As we can see, as a
process engineer in the production
plant, where she spends 80 percent
of her time, Cindy has a clear, crisp
reporting arrangement to her
supervising engineer, and through
him, to the

(Jindy


Cindy


plant engineering manager. But as a
member of the process coordinating
group, she is also supervised by its
chairman. So we see that Cindy's
name appears on two organization
charts that serve two separate
purposes— one to operate the
production plant, the other to
coordinate the efforts of various


plants. Again we see dual reporting
because Cindy has two supervisors.


Cindy's two responsibilities won't
fit on a single organization chart.
Instead, we have to think of the
coordinating group as existing on a
different chart, or on a different
plane. This sounds complicated but
really isn't. If Cindy belonged to a
church, she would be regarded a
member of that organization as well
as being part of Intel. Her
supervisor there, as it were, would
be the local pastor, who in turn is a
member of the church hierarchy.
No one would confuse these two
roles: clearly operating on different


planes, each has its own
hierarchies, and that Cindy is a
member of both groups at the same
time would hardly trouble anyone.
Cindy's being part of a coordinating
group is like her church
membership.


Our ability to use Cindy's skill and
know-how in two different
capacities makes it possible for her
to exert a much larger leverage at
Intel. In her main job, her
knowledge affects the work that
takes place in one plant; in her
second, through what she does in
the process coordinating group, she
can influence the work of all plants.


So we see that the existence of such
groups is a way for managers,
especially know-how managers, to
increase their leverage.


The two-plane concept is a part of
everyday organizational life. For
instance, while people mosdy work
at an operating task, they also plan.
The hierarchy of the corporation's
planning bodies lies on a plane
separate from the one on which
you'll find the operating groups.
Moreover, if a person can operate in
two planes, he can operate in three.
Cindy could also be part of a task
force to


achieve a specific result in which
her expertise is needed. This is as if
Cindy were to work at Intel, to
belong to a church, and to do
advisory work for the town's parks
department, l hese are separate
roles and do not conflict with one
another, though they all do vie for
Cindy's time.


It could also turn out that people
who are in a
subordinate/supervisory
relationship in one plane might find
the relationship reversed in
another. For example, I am
president of Intel, but in another
plane I am a member of a strategic


planning group, where I report to
its chairman, who is one of our
division controllers. It's as if I were
a member of the Army Reserve, and
on our weekend exercises I found
myself under the command of a
regimental leader who happens to
be this division controller, back at
the operating ranch, I may be his
supervisor or his supervisor's
supervisor, but in the Army Reserve
he is my commanding officer.


The point is that the two- (or multi) plane organization is very useful.
Without it I could only partiripate if
I were in charge of everything I was
part of. I don't have that kind of


time, and often I'm not the most
qualified person around to lead. The
multi-plane organization enables
me to serve as a foot soldier rather
than as a general when appropriate
and useful. This gives the
organization important flexibility.


Many of the groups that we are
talking about here are temporary.
Some, like task forces, are
specifically formed for a purpose,
while others are merely an informal
collection of people who work
together to solve a particular
problem. Both cease to work as a
group once the problem has been
handled. The more varied the


nature of the problems we face and
the more rapidly things change
around us, the more we have to rely
on such specially composed
transitory teams to cope with
matters. In the electronics business,
we can't possibly shift formal
organization fast enough to keep up
with the pace of ad vane

ing technology. The techniques that
we have to master to make hybrid
organizations work—dual or
multiple reporting and also
decision-making by peer groups—
are both necessary if such
transitory teams are to work. The
key factor common to all is the use


of cultural values as a mode of
control, which we will consider

next.


10


Modes of Control


Let's look at the ways in which our
actions can be controlled or
influenced. Say you need new tires
for your car. You go down the street
to the dealer and take a look at the

various lines he has to offer. Then
you'll probably go up the street to
see what the competition has.
Maybe later you'll turn to a
consumer magazine to helD von


choose. Eventually, you'll make a
decision based on one tiling: your
own self-interest. You want to buy
the tires you think will meet your
needs at the lowest cost to you. It is
quite unlikely that any personal
feelings toward the tire dealer will
come to mind. You are not

concerned about fas welfare—
there's not much chance that you
would say to him that he isn't
charging you enough for the tires.
Now you have the tires on your car
and you drive off Alter a while, you
come to a red light. You stop. Do
you thmk about it? No. It's a law
established bv the societv at large


that everybody stops at a red light
and you unquestiomngly accept and
live by it. Vehicular chaos would
reign if aH drivers had not entered
into a contract co scop, i he tramc
cop monitors adherence and
penalizes those who break the law.


After the light changes, you
continue on down the roa^ and
come upon the scene of a major
accident. Quite


likely, you'll forget about laws like
not stopping on a freeway and also
forget about your own self-interest:
you'll probably do everything you
can to help the accident victims


and, in the meantime, expose
yourself to all kinds of dangers and
risks. What motivates you now is
not at all what did when you were
shopping for tires or stopping at the
red light: not self-interest or
obeying the law, but concern about
someone else's life.


Similarly, our behavior in a work
environment can be controlled by
three invisible and pervasive
means. These are:


- free-market forces


- contractual obligations


- cultural values


Free-Market Forces


When you bought your tires, your
actions were governed by freemarket forces, which are based on
price: goods and services are being
exchanged between two entities
(individuals, organizational units,
or corporations), with each seeking
only to enrich himself or itself. This
is very simple. It is a matter of "I
want to buy the tire at the lowest
price I can get" versus "I want to
sell the tire at the highest price I
can get." Neither party here cares if
the other goes bankrupt, nor do


they pretend to. This is a very
efficient way to buy and sell tires.
No one is needed to oversee the
transaction because everyone is
openly serving his own self-interest.


So why aren't the forces of the
marketplace used all the time in all
circumstances? Because to work,
the goods and services bought and
sold must possess a very clearly
defined dollar value. The free
market can easily establish a price
for something as simple as tires.
But for much else that changes
hands in a work or business
environment, value is hard to
establish.


*46 HIGH OUTPUT
MANAGEMENT


Contractual Obligations


Transactions between companies
are usually governed by the free
market. When we buy a commodity
product from a vendor, we are
trying to get it at the best possible
price, and vice versa. But what
happens when the value of
something is not easily denned?
What happens, for instance, when it
takes a group of people to
accomplish a certain task? How
much does each of them contribute

to the value the business adds to
