You have trusted me enough to buy
my book and read it. Now let me say
a final thing: if you do at least 100
points worth of what you find here,


you'll be a distinctly better manager
for it.


Production Points


Identify the operations in your
work most like process, assembly,
and test production. 10


For a project you are working on,
identify the limiting step and map
out the flow of work around it.


Define the proper places for the
equivalents of receiving inspection,
in-process inspection, and final
inspection in your work. Decide
whether these inspections should


be


Points


monitoring steps or gate-like.
Identify the conditions under which
you can relax things and move to a
variable inspection scheme. io


Identify half a dozen new indicators
for your group's output. They
should measure both the quantity
and quality of the output. 10


Install these new indicators as a
routine in your work area, and
establish their regular review in
your staff meetings. 20


What is the most important
strategy (plan of action) you are
pursing now? Describe the
environmental demand that
prompted it and your current status
or momentum. Is your strategy
likely to result in a satisfactory state
of affairs for you or your
organization if successfully
implemented? 20


Leverage


Conduct work simplification on
your most tedious, time-consuming
task. Eliminate at least 30 percent
of the total number of steps
involved. 10


Define your output: What are the
output elements of the organization
you manage and the organizations
you can influence? List them in
order of importance. 10


Analyze your information- and
knowledge-gathering system. Is it
properly balanced among
"headlines," "newspaper articles,"
and "weekly news magazines"? Is
redundancy built in? IO


Take a "tour." Afterward, list the
transactions you got involved in
during its course. 10


Points


Create a once-a-month "excuse" for

a tour. 10


Describe how you will monitor the
next project you delegate to a
subordinate. What will you look
for? How? How frequently? 10


Generate an inventory of projects
on which


you can work at discretionary times.

10


Hold a scheduled one-on-one with
each of your subordinates. (Explain
to them in advance what a one-onone is about. Have them prepare for


it.) 2 °


Look at your calendar for the last
week. Classify your activities as
low-/medium-/high-lev-erage.
Generate a plan of action to do
more of the high-leverage category.
(What activities will you reduce?)

10


Forecast the demand on your time
for the next week. What portion of
your time is likely to be spent in
meetings? Which of these are
process-oriented meetings?
Mission-oriented meetings? If the
latter are over 25 percent of your
total time, what should you do to


reduce them? 10


Define the three most important
objectives for your organization for
the next three months. Support
them with key results. 20


Have your subordinates do the
same for themselves, after a
thorough discussion of the set
generated above. 20


Generate an inventory of pending
decisions you are responsible for.
Take three and structure the
decision-making process for them,
using the six-question approach. 10

224 HIGH OUTPUT
MANAGEMENT


Performance p oims


Evaluate your own motivational
state in terms of the Maslow
hierarchy. Do the same for each of
your subordinates.


Give your subordinates a racetrack:
define a set of performance
indicators for each.


List the various forms of taskrelevant feedback your


subordinates receive. How well can
they gauge their progress through
them?


Classify the task-relevant maturity
of each of your subordinates as low,
medium, or high. Evaluate the
management style that would~be
most appropriate for each. Compare
what your own style is with what it
should be.


Evaluate the last performance
review you received and also the
last set of reviews you gave to your
subordinates as a means of
delivering task-relevant feedback.
How well did the reviews do to


improve performance? What was
the nature of the communication
process during the delivery of each?


Redo one of these reviews as it

should have been done.

5 MANAGERIAL LEVERAGE


47 a manager's work is never done:
Lest you think I am


unique, I hasten to point out that I
am not; I discovered, with great
relief, in a study by Henry
Mintzberg ("The Manager's Job:
Folklore and Fact/' Harvard


NOTES


Business Review, vol. 53, no. 4,
July-August 1975, pp. 49-61) that
other managers' days are altogether
similar to mine.


51 The idea of "nudging" as an
important element of
