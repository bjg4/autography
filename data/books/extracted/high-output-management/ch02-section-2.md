Here are my candidates. First, you'll
want to know your sales forecast for
the day. How many breakfasts
should you plan to deliver? To
assess how much confidence you
should place in your forecast, you
would want to know how many you
delivered yesterday compared to
how many you planned on
delivering—in other words, the
variance between your plan and the
actual delivery of breakfasts for the
preceding day.


Your next key indicator is raw
material inventory. Do you have


enough eggs, bread, and coffee on
hand to keep your factory running
today? If you find you have too
little inventory, you can still order
more. If you find you have too
much, you may want to cancel
today's egg delivery. Another
important piece of information is
the condition of your equipment. If
anything broke down yesterday, you
will want to get it repaired or
rearrange your production line to
meet your forecast for the day.


You also must get a fix on your
manpower. If two waiters are out
sick, you will have to come up with
something if you are still going to


meet the demand forecasted.
Stiould you call in temporary help?
Should you take someone off the
toaster line and make him a waiter?


finally, you want to have some kind
of quality indicator. It is not enough
to monitor the number of
breakfasts each waiter delivers,
because the waiters could have

been rude to the customers even as
they served a record number of
breakfasts. Because your business
depends on people wanting what
you sell, you must be concerned
with the public's opinion of your
service. Perhaps you should set up a
"customer complaint log"


maintained by the cashier. If one of
your waiters elicited more than the
usual number of complaints
yesterday, you will want to speak to
him first thing today.


All these indicators measure factors
essential to running your factory. If
you look at them early every day,


you will often be able to do
something to correct a potential
problem before it becomes a real
one during the course of the day.


Indicators tend to direct your
attention toward what they are
monitoring. It is like riding a


bicycle: you will probably steer it
where you are looking. If, for
example, you start measuring your
inventory levels carefully, you are
likely to take action to drive your
inventory levels down, which is
good up to a point. But your
inventories could become so lean
that you can't react to changes in
demand without creating shortages.
So because indicators direct one's
activities, you should guard against
overreacting. This you can do by
pairing indicators, so that together
both effect and counter-effect are
measured. Thus, in the inventory
example, you need to monitor both


inventory levels and the incidence
of shortages. A rise in the latter will
obviously lead you to do things to
keep inventories from becoming too
low.


The principle here was evident
many times in the development of a
compiler. Measuring the
completion date of each software
unit against its capability is one
example. Watching this pair of
indicators should help us to avoid
working on the perfect compiler
that will never be ready, and also to
avoid rushing to finish one that is
inadequate. In sum, joint
monitoring is likely to keep things


in the optimum middle ground.


Nowhere can indicators—and paired
indicators—be of more help than in
administrative work. Having come
to this realization, our company has
been using measurements as a key
tool to improve the productivity of
administrative work for several
years. The first rule is that a
measurement—any measurement—
is better than none. But a genuinely
effective indicator will cover the
output of the work unit and not
simply the activity involved.
Obviously, you measure a salesman
by the orders he gets (output), not
by the calls he makes (activity).


The second criterion for a good
indicator is that what


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


you measure should be a physical,
countable thing. Examples of
effective measures of
administrative output are snuwn
below. Because those listed here are
all quantity or output indicators,
their paired counterparts should
stress the quality of work. Thus, in
accounts oavable. the number of
vouchers processed should be
paired with the number of errors
found either by auditing or bv our
suppliers. For another example, the


number of square feet cleaned by a
custodial group should be paired
with a partially objective/partially
subjective rating of the quality of
work as assessed by a senior
manager with an umce in that
building.

Such indicators have many uses.
First, they spell out very clearly


what the objectives of an individual
or eronn are. Second, they provide a
degree of objectivity when
measuring an administrative
function. Third, and as important as
any, they give us a measure by
which various administrative
groups performing the same
function in different organizations
can be compared with each other.

group in a second building. In fact,
if indicators are put in place, the
competitive spirit engendered
frequently has an electrifying effect
on the motivation each group
brings to its work, along with a
parallel improvement in
performance. More about this later
when we examine the "sports
analogy,"


The Black Box


We can think of our breakfast
factory as if it were a "black box":
input (the raw materials) and the
labor of waiters, helpers, and you,
the manager, flowing into the box,


and the output (the breakfast)
flowing out of it as illustrated
below. In general, we can represent
any activity that resembles a
production process in a simple
fashion as


Raw Material


Breakfast


Labor


The breakfast factory — as a "black
box/ 9


a black box. Thus, we can draw a
black box to represent college
recruiting, where the input is the
applicants on campus and the
output is college graduates who
have accepted our employment
offers. The labor is the work of our
on-campus interviewers and the
managers and technical people who
interview back at the plant.
Similarly, the process of field sales
training can be seen as a black box
with the input being the raw
product specifications and the
output being trained sales


personnel. The labor here is the
work of the mar

HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


keting and merchandising people
who turn raw information into

usable sales tools and train the field
sales personnel to exploit them. In
fact, we can represent most, if not
all, administrative work by our
magical black box. A group whose
job is to bill customers has as its
input the information about the
customer—what he has purchased,
the pricing data, and the shipment
records; and output is the final bill
sent to the customer through which


payment is collected. The labor is
the work of all personnel involved.


The black box sorts out what the
inputs, the output, and the labor are
in the production process. We can
improve our ability to run that
process by cutting some zvindows
in our box so that we can see some
of what goes on within it. By
looking through the openings, as
illustrated below, we can better
understand the internal workings of
any production process and assess
what the future output is likely to
be.


By peering through the xrindows in
the black box, we can get an idea of
what the future output is likely to
be.


Leading indicators give you one way
to look inside the black box by
showing you in advance what the
future might look like. And because
they give you time to take corrective
action, they make it possible for you
to avoid problems. Of course, for


leading indicators to do you any
good, you must believe in their
validity. While this may seem
obvious, in practice, confidence is
not as easy to come by as it sounds.
To take big, costly, or worrisome


Managing the breakfast Factory


21


steps when you are not yet sure you
have a problem is hard. But unless
you are prepared to act on what
your leading indicators are telling
you, all you will get from
monitoring them is anxiety. Thus,
the indicators you choose should be


credible, so that you will, in fact, act
whenever they flash warning
signals.


Leading indicators might include
the daily monitors we use to run
our breakfast factory, from machine
downtime records to an index of

customer satisfaction—both of
which can tell us if problems lie
down the road. A generally
applicable example of a "window* 5
cut into the black box is the
linearity indicator. In the figure
below, we provide one for the
college recruiting process. Plotted
here is the number of college
graduates who have accepted our


offers versus the month of the year.
If all went ideally, we would move
along the straight line that would
yield our hiring target for the
semester by the month of June. If
by April the actual progress is as
shown here, we will find ourselves
far below the ideal straight line. So

The linearity indicator can give us
an early warning that we are likely
to miss our target


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


from reading the indicator, we
know that the only way we can hit
our target is by getting acceptance
at a much higher rate m the
remaining two months than we had
gotten in the preceding four. Thus,
the linearity indicator Hashes an
early warning, allowing us time to
take corrective action. Without it,
we would discover that we Had
missed our target in June, when
nothing can be done about it.


If we consider a manufacturing unit
in this fashion, we may assume that
because it makes monthly goals
regularly all is well. But we can cut
a window into the black box here,


measure production output against
time as the month proceeds, and
compare that with the ideal linear
output. We may learn that output
performance is soread evenly
throughout the course of the month
or that it is concentrated in the last

week of the month. If the latter is
tne case, the manager of the unit is
probably not using manpower and
equipment efficiently. And if the
situation is not remedied, one
minor breakdown toward month s

end could cause the unit to miss its
monthlv output goal entirely. The
linearity indicator will help you
anticipate such a problem and is

Another sound way to anticipate the
future is through


the use of the stagger chart, which
forecasts an output over

23


the next several months. The chart
is updated monthly, so that each


month you will have an updated
version of the then-current forecast
information as compared to several
prior forecasts. You can readily see
the variation of one forecast from
the next, which can help you
anticipate future trends better than
if you used a simple trend chart.


In my experience, nowhere has the
stagger chart been more productive
than in forecasting economic
trends. The way it works is shown
in the figure below, which gives us
forecasted rates of incoming orders
for an Intel division* The stagger
chart then provides the same
forecast prepared in the following


month, in the month after that, and
so on. Such a chart shows not only
your outlook for business month by
month but also how your outlook

month)


/ have found the "stagger chart" the
best means of getting a feel for
future business trends.


varied from one month to the next.
This way of looking at incoming
business, of course, makes whoever
does the forecasting take his task


very seriously, because he knows
tuat nis torecast for any given
month will be routinely compared
with future forecasts and eventually
with the accuai result. But even
more important, the improvement
or deterioration of the forecasted

outlook from one month to the next
provides the most valuable
indicator of business trends that I
have ever seen. I would go as rar as
to say that it's too bad that all
economists" and investment
advisers aren't obliged to display
their fore-casts in a stagger chart
form. Then we could really have a
way to evaluate whatever any one of


them chooses to sav. finally,
indicators can be a big help in
solving all types of Problems. If
something goes wrong, you will
have a bank of information that
readily shows all the parameters of
your operation, allowing you to
scan them for unhealthy departures
from the norm. If you do not
systematically collect and maintain
an archive of indicators, you will
have to do an awful lot of quick
research to get ~e information you
need, and by the time you have it,
the problem is likely to have gotten

worse.


Controlling Future Output


There are two ways to control the
output of any factory. Some
industries build to order. For
example, when vn„ L Mopping tor a
sofa, you are going to have to wait a
long


ZZT\T l ?° U ^ Ught ' UnIeSS ^ bu ?
il right off ET™ u A fUmitUre
GuXor y Mds to order. When it
kams what you want, the factory
looks for a hole in its


manufacturing schedule and makes
the item for you If you order a new
car rather than buying one right off
the ot, the same thing happens: the
plant will paint the car m he color


you want and provide the options
you want out you wiH have to wait
for it. And our breakfa t factory" of
course, builds breakfasts to order.


But if your competition in the sofa
business makes the same product
but has it ready in four weeks while
you need four months, you are not
going to have many customers. So
even though you would much
rather build to order, you will have
to use another way to control the
output of your factory. In short, you
will have to build to forecast, which
is a contemplation of future orders.
To do this, the manufacturer sets
up his activities around a reasoned


speculation that orders will
materialize for specific products
within a certain time.


An obvious disadvantage here is
that the manufacturer takes an
inventory risk. Since the forecast is
an assessment of future
requirements, which the
manufacturer commits resources to
satisfy, the factory could be in an
immense amount of trouble if the
orders do not materialize or if they
materialize for a product other than
the one anticipated. In either case,
unwanted inventory is the result.
To build to forecast, you risk capital
to respond to anticipated future


demand in good order.


At Intel, we build to forecast
because our customers demand that
we respond to their needs in a
timely fashion, even though our
manufacturing throughput times
are quite long. Our breakfast factory
makes its product to customer
order, but buys from its suppliers—
like the egg man—on the basis of
forecasted demand. Similarly, most
companies recruit new college
graduates to fill anticipated needs—
rather than recruiting only when a
need develops, which would be
foolish because college graduates
are turned out in a highly seasonal


fashion. Computer software
products, such as compilers, are
also typically developed in response
to an anticipated market need
rather than to specific customer
order. So "building" to forecast is a
very common business practice.


Delivering a product that was built
to forecast to a customer consists of
two simultaneous processes, each
with a separate time cycle. A
manufacturing flow must


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


occur in which the raw material
moves through various production


steps and finally enters the finished
goods warehouse, as illustrated
below. Simultaneously, a salesman
finds a prospect and sells to that
prospect, who eventually places an
order with the manufacturer.
Ideally, the order for the product
and the product itself should arrive
on the shipping dock at the same
time.


Because the art and science of
forecasting is so complex, you
might be tempted to give all
forecasting responsibility to a single
manager who can be made
accountable for it. But this usually
does not work very well. What


works better is to ask both the
manufacturing and the sales
departments to prepare a forecast,
so that people are responsible for
performing against their own
predictions.


At Intel we try to match the two
parallel flows with as much
precision as possible. If there's no
match, we end up with a customer
order that we can't satisfy or with a
finished product for which we have
no customer. Either way we have
problems. Obviously, if the match
does come off, with a forecasted
order becoming a real order,


The order for the product and the
product itself should arrive at the
shipping dock at the same time.


the customer's requirements can be
nicely satisfied with the factory's
product delivery.


The ideal is rarely found in the real
world. More often, customer orders
don't develop in time or the
customer changes his mind. As for
the other flow, manufacturing could
miss deadlines, or make mistakes,
or encounter unforeseen problems.
Because neither the sales flow nor
the manufacturing flow is
completely predictable, we should


deliberately build a reasonable
amount of "slack" into the system.
And inventory is the most obvious
place for it. Clearly, the more
inventory we have, the more change
we can cope with and still satisfy
orders. But inventory costs money
to build and keep, and therefore
should be controlled carefully.
Ideally, inventory should be kept at
the lowest-value stage, as we've
learned before, like raw eggs kept at
the breakfast factory. Also, the
lower the value, the more
production flexibility we obtain for
a given inventory cost.


It is a good idea to use stagger


charts In both the manufacturing
and sales forecasts. As noted, they
will show the trend of change from
one forecast to another, as well as
the actual results. By repeatedly
observing the variance of one
forecast from another, you will
continually pin down the causes of
inaccuracy and improve your ability
to forecast both orders and the
availability of product.


Forecasting future work demands
and then adjusting the output of an
"administrative factory" represents
a very important way in which its
productivity can be increased.
Though an old and honored way of


operating "widget factories," the
application of forecasting
techniques is hardly common as a
way to control administrative work.
Such work has up to now been
considered qualitatively different
from work in a widget factory, and
has also lacked objective
performance standards needed to
size or scale the work unit.


But if we have carefully chosen
indicators that char

*8 HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


acterize an administrative unit and
watch them closely, we are ready to


apply the methods of factory
control to administrative work. We
can use de facto standards, inferred
from the trend data, to forecast the
number of people needed to
accomplish various anticipated
tasks. By rigorous application of the
principles of forecasting, manpower
can be reassigned from one area to
another, and the headcount made to
match the forecasted growth or
decline in administrative activity.
Without rigor, the staffing of
administrative units would always
be left at its highest level and, given
Parkinson's famous law, people
would find ways to let whatever


they're doing fill the time available
for its completion. There is no
question that having standards and*
believing in them and staffing an
administrative unit objectively
using forecasted workloads will
help you to maintain and enhance
productivity.


Assuring Quality


As we have said, manufacturing's
charter is to deliver product at a
quality level acceptable to the
customer at minimum cost. To
assure that the quality of our
product will in fact be acceptable,
all production flows, whether they


"make" breakfasts, college
graduates, or software modules,
must possess inspection points. To
get acceptable quality at the lowest
cost, it is vitally importantto reject
defective material at a stage where
its accumulated value is at the
lowest possible level. Thus, as
noted, we are better off catching a
bad raw egg than a cooked one, and
screening out our college applicant
before he visits Intel. In short,
reject before investing further
value.


In the language of production, the
lowest-value-point inspection
where we inspect raw material is


called incoming material inspection
or receiving inspection. If we again
use a black box to represent our
production process,inspections that
occur at intervening points within it
are called.


Managing the Breakfast Factory


29


logically enough, in-process
inspections. Finally, the last
possible point of inspection, when
the product is ready to be shipped
to the customer, is called final
inspection or outgoing quality
inspection. The three types are


depicted below.


From supplier


To customer


In-Process


Inspection


The key principle is to reject the
defective "material" at its lowestvalue stage.


When material is rejected at
incoming inspection, a couple of
choices present themselves. We can
send it back to the vendor as


unacceptable, or we can waive our
specifications and use the
substandard material anyway. The
latter would result in a higher reject
rate in our production process than
if we had used thoroughly
acceptable material, but that might
be less expensive than shutting
down the factory altogether until
our vendor provides better material.
Such decisions can only be made
properly by a balanced group of
managers, which typically consists
of representatives from the quality
assurance, manufacturing, and
design engineering departments.
This group can weigh all the


consequences of rejecting or
accepting substandard raw material.


While in most instances the
decision to accept or reject defective
material at a given inspection point
is an economic one, one should
never let substandard material


proceed when its defects could
cause a complete failure -a re MU y
proornn-for our customer. Simply
put because we can never assess the
consequences of an unreli-a^e

compromises when it comes o

cess. A monitor produces no
comparable slowdown but might let
some bad material escape before we
can act on the monitor's results and
shut things down, which means
that we might have to reject
material later at a higher-value
stage. Clearly, for the same money
we can do a lot more monitoring


than gate-type inspections; if we do
the former, we may well contribute
more to the overall quality of the
product than if we choose less
frequent gatelike inspections. The
trade-off here is not obvious, and
any choice has to be made with a
specific case in mind. As a rule of
thumb, we should lean toward
monitoring when experience shows
we are not likely to encounter big
problems.


Another way to lower the cost of
quality assurance is to use variable
inspections. Because quality levels
vary over time, it is only common
sense to vary how often we inspect.


For instance, if for weeks we don't
find problems, it would seem logical
to check less often. But if problems
begin to develop, we can test ever
more frequently until quality again
returns to the previous high levels.
The advantage here is still lower
costs and even less interference
with the production flow. Yet this
approach is not used very often,
even in widget manufacturing. Why
not? Probably because we are
creatures of habit and keep doing
things the way we always have,
whether it be from week to week or

year to year.


Suitably thought through,


intelligent inspection schemes can
actually increase the efficiency and
productivity of any manufacturing
or administrative process. Let's take
an example very different from the
making of widgets or breakfasts.


I recently read a story in a news
magazine that said that the
American Embassy in London could
not deal with a deluge of visa
applications. Some one million
Britons apply for visas each year, of
which about 98 percent are
approved. The embassy employs
sixty people, who process as many
as 6,000 applications a day. Most
applica

tions are received by mail, and at
any time, from 60,000 to 80,000
British passports are in the
embassy's hands. Meanwhile, lines
of one hundred or more British and

other nationals stand in front of the
building, looking for an opportunity
to walk their passports through.
The embassy has tried a number of
ways to handle matters more
efficiently, including newspaper
advertisements asking tourists to
apply early and to expect a threeweek turn" around. The embassy
also installed boxes where
applicants could drop off their
passports and visa applications if


they really needed same-day
service. Even so, the lines at the
embassy remained long.


In fact, the embassy's expediting
schemes onlv made the problem
worse, because nothing was done to
address the basic issue: to speed the
processing of visas overall. Time
and money were spent to classify
various kinds of applications slated
for different processing- times, but
this only created more logistical
overhead with no effect on output.


If our government wants British
tourists to visit the United States,
our government should not irritate


these would-be visitors. And if the
embassy can't get the money to
increase its staff, a simple solution
can be borrowed from basic
production techniques. We need, in
short, to replace their present
scheme with a oualitv'as-surance

test.


For that, the bureaucratic minds at
the embassy would need to accept
that a 100 percent check of the visa
applicants is unnecessary. Some 98
percent of those applying are
approved without any question. So
if the embassy were to institute a
sampling test of visas (a quality
assurance test), and a thorough one


at that, the logjam of applications
could be broken without materially
increasing the chance that the
undesirable will enter our county.
Moreover, the embassy could select
the sample to be checked according
to predetermined criteria. The visa
processing could then work rather
like the Internal Reve

nue Service. Through the checks
and audits that the IRS performs,
that government agency induces
compliance among most taxpayers
without having an agent look at
every single return.


Later, when we examine managerial


productivity, we'll see that when a
manager digs deeply into a specific
activity under his jurisdiction, he's
applying the principle of variable
inspection. If the manager
examined everything his various
subordinates did, he would be
meddling, which for the most part
would be a waste of his time. Even
worse, his subordinates would
become accustomed to not being
responsible for their own work,
knowing full well that their
supervisor will check everything out
closely. The principle of variable
inspection applied to managerial
work nicely skirts both problems,


and, as we shall see, gives us an
important tool for improving
managerial productivity.


Productivity


The workings of our black box can
furnish us with the simplest and
most useful definition of
productivity. The productivity of
any function occurring within it is
the output divided by the labor
required to generate the output.
Thus, one way to increase
productivity is to do whatever we
are now doing, but faster. This
could be done by reorganizing the
work area or just by working
