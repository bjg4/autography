Illustrated on page 90 is an ideal
model of decisionmaking in a
know-how business. The first stage
should be free discussion, in which
all points of view and all aspects of
an issue are openly welcomed and
debated. The


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


IF WRONG


The ideal decision-making process.


greater the disagreement and
controversy, the more important
becomes the word free. This sounds
obvious, but it's not often the
practice. Usually when a meeting
gets heated, participants hang back,
trying to sense the direction of
things, saying nothing until they
see what view is likely to prevail.
They then throw their support
behind that view to avoid being
associated with a losing position,
bizarre as it may seem, some
organizations actually encourage
such behavior. Let me quote from a
news account relating to the woes
of a certain American automobile


company: "In the meeting in which
I was informed that Iwas released, I
was told, 'Bill, in general, people
who do well in this company wait
until they hear their superiors
express their view and then
contribute something in support of
that view/ " This is a terrible way to
manage. All it produces is bad
decisions, because if


Decisions, Decisions gi


knowledgeable people withhold
opinions, whatever is decided will
be based on information and insight
less complete than it could have
been otherwise.


The next stage is reaching a clear
decision. Again, the greater the
disagreement about the issue, the
more important becomes the word
clear. In fact, particular pains
should be taken to frame the terms
of the decision with utter clarity.
Again, our tendency is to do just the
opposite: when we know a decision
is controversial we want to obscure
matters to avoid an argument. But
the argument is not avoided by our
being mealy-mouthed, merely
postponed. People who don't like a
decision will be a lot madder if they
don't get a prompt and straight
story about it.


Finally, everyone involved must
give the decision reached by the
group full support. This does not
necessarily mean agreement: so
long as the participants commit to
back the decision, that is a
satisfactory outcome. Many people
have trouble supporting a decision
with which they do not agree, but
that they need to do so is simply
inevitable. Even when we all have

the same facts and we all have the
interests of an organization in
mind, we tend to have honest,
strongly felt, real differences of
opinion. No matter how much time
we may spend trying to forge


agreement, we just won't be able to
get it on many issues. But an
organization does not live by its
members agreeing with one another
at all times about everything. It
lives instead by people committing
to support the decisions and the
moves of the business. All a
manager can expect is that the
commitment to support is honestly
present, and this is something he
can and must get from everyone.


The ideal decision-making model
seems an easy one to follow. Yet I
have found that it comes easily to
only two classes of professional
employees—senior managers who


have been in the company for a long
time, who feel at home with the
way things are done, and who
identify


with the values of the organization;
and the new graduates that we hire,
because they used the model as
students doing college work. This is
the way a team of students working
on a laboratory experiment will
resolve its differences, so for the
young engineer the Intel model is a
continuation of what he was used
to. But for middle managers, the
decision-making model is easier to
accept intellectually than it is to
practice. Why? Because they often


have trouble expressing their views
forcefully, a hard time making
unpleasant or difficult decisions,
and an even harder time with the
idea that they are expected to
support a decision with which they
don't agree. It may take a while, but
the logic of the ideal scheme will
eventually win everyone over.


Another desirable and important
feature of the model is that any
decision be worked out and reached
at the lowest competent level. The
reason is that this is where it will be
made by people who are closest to
the situation and know the most
about it. And by "know" I don't just


mean "understand technically."
That kind of expertise must be
tempered with judgment, which is
developed through experience and
learning from the many errors one
has made in one's career. Thus,
ideally, decision-making should
occur in the middle ground,
between reliance on technical
knowledge on the one hand, and on
the bruises one has received from
having tried to implement and
apply such knowledge on the other.
To make a decision, if you can't find
people with both qualities, you
should aim to get the best possible
mix of participants available. For


experience, we at Intel are likely to
ask a person in management senior
to the other members of the group
to come to the meeting. But it is
very important that everybody there
voice opinions and beliefs as equals
throughout the free discussion
stage, forgetting or ignoring status
differentials.


A journalist puzzled by our
management style once asked me,
"Mr. Grove, isn't your company's
emphasis on


Decisions, Decisions ga


visible signs of egalitarianism such


as informal dress, partitions instead
of offices, and the absence of other
obvious perks like reserved parking
spaces, just so much affectation?"
My answer was that this is not
affectation but a matter of survival.

In our business we have to mix
knowledge-power people with
position-power people daily, and
together they make decisions that
could affect us for years to come. If
we don't link our engineers with
our managers in such a way as to
get good decisions, we can't succeed
in our industry. Now, status
symbols most certainly do not
promote the flow of ideas, facts, and


points of view. What appears to be a
matter of style really is a matter of
necessity.


The Peer-Group Syndrome


The model is also hard to
implement because anybody who
makes a business decision also
possesses emotions such as pride,
ambition, fear, and insecurity.
These tend to come to the surface
quickly when people who are not
used to working with one another
are asked to make a decision. This

means we need to think about what
keeps decision-making from
happening smoothly along the lines


we've advocated.


The most common problem is
something we call the peer-group
syndrome. A number of years ago,
at Intel's very first management
training session, we tried some
role-playing to show people what
can occur when a group of peers
meets to solve a problem or make a
decision. We sat the people around
a table to tackle what was then a
live issue for them in their real jobs.
Everyone was an organizational
equal. The chairman of the meeting
was one level higher, but was
purposely sent out of the room so
he couldn't hear what was to


happen. Observers in the audience
couldn't believe their eyes and ears
as the mock meeting proceeded.
The managers working on the
problem did nothing but go around
in circles for some fifteen


minutes, and none of them noticed
they weren't getting anywhere.
When the chairman was brought
back in, he sat down and listened
for a while and couldn't believe
things either. We watched him lean
forward as if he were trying to glean
more from the conversation. We

then saw a black cloud form over
his head; finally he slapped the
table and exclaimed, "What's going


on here? You people are talking in
circles and getting nowhere." After
the chairman intervened, the
problem was resolved in very short
order. We named this the peer-plusone approach, and have used it
since then to aid decision-making
where we must. Peers tend to look
for a more senior manager, even if
he is not the most competent or
knowledgeable person involved, to
take over and shape a meeting.


Why? Because most people are
afraid to stick their necks out. This
is how John, an Intel software
engineer, sees things:


One of the reasons why people are
reluctant to come out with an
opinion in the presence of their
peers is the fear of going against the
group by stating an opinion that is
different from that of the group.
Consequently, the group as a whole
wanders around for a while, feeling
each other out, waiting for a
consensus to develop before anyone
risks taking a position. If and when
a group consensus emerges, one of
the members will state it as a group
opinion ("I think our position
seems to be .. ."), not as a personal
position. After a weak statement of
the group position, if the rest of the


mob buys in, the position becomes
more solid and is restated more
forcefully.


Note the difference between the
situation described earlier by the
auto executive and the one John
describes. In the former instance,
the people were expected to wait for
their supervisor to state his opinion
first. In the latter, members of the
group were waiting for a consensus

to


develop. The dynamics are
different, but the bottom line in
both is that people didn't really
speak their minds freely. That


certainly makes it harder for a
manager to make the right
decisions.


You can overcome the peer-group
syndrome if each of the members
has self-confidence, which stems in
part from being familiar with the
issue under consideration and from
experience. But in the end selfconfidence mostly comes from a
gut-level realization that nobody
has ever died from making a wrong
business decision, or taking
inappropriate action, or being
overruled. And everyone in your
operation should be made to
understand this.


If the peer-group syndrome
manifests itself, and the meeting
has no formal chairman, the person
who has the most at stake should
take charge. If that doesn't work,
one can always ask the senior
person present to assume control.
He is likely to be no more expert in
the issues at hand than other
members of the group—perhaps
less expert—but he is likely to act as
a godfather, a repository of
knowledge about how decisions
should be made, and give the group
the confidence needed to make a

decision.


One thing that paralyzes both


knowledge and position power
possessors is the fear of simply
sounding dumb. For the senior
person, this is likely to keep him
from asking the questions he
should ask. The same fear will
make other participants merely
think their thoughts privately
rather than articulate them for all
to hear; at best they will whisper
what they have to say to a neighbor.
As a manager, you should remind
yourself that each time an insight
or fact is withheld and an
appropriate question is suppressed,
the decision-making process is less
good than it might have been.


A related phenomenon influences
lower-level people present in the
meeting. This group has to
overcome the


q6 high output management


fear of being overruled, which
might mean embarrassment: if the
rest of the group or a senior-level
manager vetoed a junior person or
opposed a position he was
advocating, the junior manager
might lose face in front of his peers.
This, even more than fear of
sanctions or even of the loss of job,
makes junior people hang back and
let the more senior people set the


likely direction of decision-making.


But some issues are so complex
that those called on to make a
decision honestly aren't really sure
how they feel When knowledge and
position power are separated, the
sense of uncertainty can become
especially acute, because the
knowledge people are often not
comfortable with the purely
business-related factors that might
influence a decision. What is often
heard is, "We don't know what the
company [or division or
department] wants of us." Similarly,
managers holding position power
don't know what to do because they


realize they don't know enough
about the technical details to arrive

at the correct decision. We must
strive not to be done in by such
obstacles. We are all human beings
endowed with intelligence and
blessed with willpower. Both can be
drawn upon to help us overcome
our fear of sounding dumb or of
being overruled, and lead us to
initiate discussion and come out

front with a stand.


Striving for the Output


Sometimes no amount of
discussion will produce a
consensus, yet the time for a


decision has clearly arrived. When
this happens, the senior person (or
"peer-plus-one") who until now has
guided, coached, and prodded the
group along has no choice but to
make a decision himself. If the
decision-making process has
proceeded correctly up to this point,
the senior manager will be making
the decision having had the full
benefit of free discussion wherein
all points of view, facts, opinions,
and


judgments were aired without
position-power prejudice. In other
words, it is legitimate—in fact,
sometimes unavoidable^—for the


senior person to wield positionpower authority if the clear decision
stage is reached and no consensus
has developed. It is not legitimate—
in fact, it is destructive—for him to
wield that authority any earlier.
This is often not easy. We
Americans tend to be reluctant to
exercise position power deliberately
and explicitly—it is just "not nice"
to give orders. Such reluctance on
the part of the senior manager can
prolong the first phase of the
decision-making process—the time
of free discussion—past the
optimum point, and the decision
will be put off.


If you either enter the decisionmaking stage too early or wait too
long, you won't derive the full
benefit of open discussion. The
criterion to follow is this: don't
push for a decision prematurely.
Make sure you have heard and
considered the real issues rather
than the superficial comments that
often dominate the early part of a
meeting. But if you feel that you
have already heard everything, that
all sides of the issue have been
raised, it is time to push for a
consensus—and failing that, to step
in and make a decision. Sometimes
free discussion goes on in an


unending search for consensus.
But, if that happens, people can
drift away from the near consensus
when they are close to being right,
diminishing the chances of reaching
the correct decision. So moving on
to make the decision at the right
time is crucial.


Basically, like other things
managers do, decisionmaking has
an output associated with it, which
in this case is the decision itself.
Like other managerial processes,
decision-making is likelier to
generate high-quality output in a
timely fashion if we say clearly at
the outset that we expect exacdy


that. In other words, one of the
manager's key tasks is to setde six
important questions in advance:


- What decision needs to be made?


- When does it have to be made?


- Who will decide?


- Who will need to be consulted
prior to making the decision?


- Who will ratify or veto the
decision?


- Who will need to be informed of

the decision?


Let me illustrate how these six
questions came into play in a recent
decision I was involved in. Intel had
already decided to expand its
Philippine manufacturing plant,
roughly doubling its capacity. The
next question was where. Only
limited space was available next to
the existing plant. But, other things
being equal, building there was the
most desirable thing to do because
overhead and communications
could be shared, transportation
costs between the two plants would
amount to virtually nothing, and
our employees could be transferred
from one plant to the other very


easily. The alternative consisted of
buying a less expensive plot of land
quite some distance away. The land
would be not only cheaper but more
plentiful, which would allow us to
build a relatively inexpensive oneor two-story building. Buying the
lot near the existing plant meant
that we would have had to build a
high-rise to get the amount of floor
space we needed, and a high-rise
semiconductor manufacturing plant
would not be the most efficient.

That made us hesitate. But it would
be nice to have a second building
next to the one we already own.
Back and forth and so on and so


forth went the discussion.


Let's apply our six questions here. It
is clear what decision needed to be
made: we either build a multistory
building next to our existing plant,
or we build a one- or two-story
building at a new outlying location.
As for the question when: according
to our long-range plans, we needed
the new plant in two to two and a
half years; if


Decisions, Decisions go


we apply time offsets, we must
make the decision within a month.

This answers the when.


Who will decide? Our
facilities/construction people or the
Intel group that manages the
manufacturing plants? The answer
is not easy. The first organization is
more sensitive to matters
pertaining to the costs and
difficulties of construction, and will
probably lean toward the new
location. The plant management
group, knowing that operational
benefits will come from having the
two plants side by side, will
probably opt for the high-rise. So
the decision-making body is
composed of our construction
manager for our Far East locations;


his supervisor, the construction
manager for the corporation; the
manager of the Far East
manufacturing plant network; and
his supervisor, the senior
manufacturing manager. The
meeting gave us parallel levels of
managers from the two
organizations. The sensitivities of
two interest groups coming to bear
on a single decision is quite
common in real corporate life. In
such meetings, it is important to
give to the two sides roughly equal
representation, because only from
such balance will an even-handed
decision emerge. All of these


individuals have consulted their
staffs prior to the decision and
gathered all relevant knowledge and
views on the subject.


Who will ratify or veto the
decision? The first common person
to whom the senior managers of
both organizations report is myself.
Also, this was a big enough deal
that the president of the company
should be involved. Moreover, I was
somewhat familiar with the
locations in the Philippines and
how a plant like the one we have
there operates. So I was chosen as
the person to veto or ratify the
decision of the meeting.


Who will need to be informed of

this decision? I chose Gordon
Moore, our chairman of the board.
He's not directly involved with
manufacturing plants like the one
contemplated, but we don't build a
new one in the Far


East every day, so he should know
about what happened. This is how
the decision was made. After
studying maps, construction plans
and costs, land costs, and traffic
patterns, and considering several
times evervthimr we thought was
important, the group decided to'
build next to our existing plant but
to accept only as much


manufacturing area as four stories
would yield. The cost would have
escalated had we exceeded that.
This, with all relevant background,
was presented to me at the meeting
described on the agenda shown in
the previous chapter. I listened to
the presentation of the alternatives
tne group considered and to the
reasons why they preferred thenchoice to these, and after asking a
series of questions and probing
both the group's information and its
UxinKing process, I ratified the
decision. Subsenu^ntlv I informed
Gordon Moore of the outcome, and
as you are reading this, the plant is


either under construction or already
operating.


Employing consistent ways by
which decisions are to be made has
value beyond simply expediting the
decision-making itself. People
invest a great deaf of energy and
emotion m coming up with a
decision. Then somebody who has
an important say-so or the right to
veto it may come across the
decision later. If he does veto it he
can be regarded as a Johnny-comelately who upsets'the uecisionmaking applecart. This, of course,
will frustrate and demoralize the
people who may have been working


on it ror a long time. If the veto
comes as a surprise" however
legitimate it may have been on its
merits, an impression of political
maneuvering is inevitably created.
Politics and manipulation or even
their aooear-ance should be avoided

at all costs. And I can think of no
better way to make the decisionmakinr nro^« straightforward than
to apply before the fart
the°structure imposed by our six
questions.


One last thing. If the final word has
to be dramatically Cerent irom the
expectations of the people who par

ticipated in the decision-making
process (had I chosen, for example,
to cancel the Philippine plant
project altogether), make your
announcement but don't just walk
away from the issue. People need
time to adjust, rationalize, and in
general put their heads back
together. Adjourn, reconvene the
meeting after people have had a
chance to recover, and solicit their
views of the decision at that time.
This will help everybody accept and
learn to live with the unexpected.


If good decision-making appears
complicated, that's because it is and
has been for a long time. Let me


quote from Alfred Sloan, who spent
a lifetime preoccupied with
decision-making: "Group decisions
do not always come easily. There is
a strong temptation for the leading
officers to make decisions

themselves without the sometimes
onerous process of discussion."
Because the process is indeed
onerous, people sometimes try to
run away from it. A middle manager
I once knew came straight from one
of the better business schools and
possessed what we might call a
'John Wayne" mentality. Having
become frustrated with the way
Intel made decisions, he quit. He


joined a company where his
employers assured him during the
interview that people were
encouraged to make individual
decisions which they were then free
to implement. Four months later,
he came back to Intel. He explained
that if he could make decisions
without consulting anybody, so
could everybody else.

Planning: Today's Actions for
Tomorrow's Output


The Planning Process


Most people think "planning" is one
of the loftier responsibilities of
management-we all learned
somewhere that "a manager plans,
organizes, controls." Tn tact,
planning is an ordinary everyday
activity; it's something au or us do
all the time with no fanfare, in both
our personal and professional lives.
For instance, as you're anvmg to
work m the morning, you are likely
to decide whether or not you need
gasoline. You look at the gauge to
see how much gas you have in the
tank, you estimate uOW iar lt ls y°
u ne ed to go, and you then make a
rough guess as to how much gas


you need to get to and from your
omce. By comparing in your mind
the gas you need with the gas you
have, you decide whether vou
should stop tor gas or not. This is a
simple example of planning. *«e
uyxiamics of planning can best be
understood by going back to our
basic production principles. As we
learned m Chapter 2, the key
method of controlling the future
output of a factory is through the
use of a svstem 01 rorecasting
demand and building to forecast.
We operated our factory to fill
existing and anticipated oroVr,


Our job was to match the factory's


output at a given time with the
orders for it. If the projected output
did not match the projected market
demand, either we made additional
production starts or we reduced
them to eliminate the excess. How
one plans at the factory can then be
summarized as follows: step 1,
determine the market demand for
product; step 2, establish what the
factory will produce if no
adjustment is made; and step 3,
reconcile the projected factory
output with the projected market
demand by adjusting the production
schedule.


Your general planning process


should consist of analogous
thinking. Step 1 is to establish
projected need or demand: What
will the environment demand from
you, your business, or your
organization? Step 2 is to establish
your present status: What are you
producing now? What will you be
producing as your projects in the
pipeline are completed? Put
another way, where will your
business be if you do nothing
different from what you are now
doing? Step 3 is to compare and
reconcile steps 1 and 2. Namely,
what more (or less) do you need to
do to produce what your


environment will demand?


Let's consider each step in more
detail.


STEP 1—ENVIRONMENTAL

DEMAND


Just what is your environment? If
you look at your own group within
an organization as if it were a standalone company, you see that your
environment is made up of other
such groups that directly influence
what you do. For example, if you
were the manager of the company's
mailroom, your environment would
consist of customers who need your


services (the rest of the company),
vendors who are able to provide you
with certain capabilities (postage
meters, mail carts), and finally,
your competitors. You don't, of
course, have competitors internally
— but you can compare your service
to one like United


Pa f^ as ? way to J ud S e
performance and set standards.


What should you look for when you
examine your environment? You
should attempt to determine your
customers* expectations and their
perception of your performance.
You should keep abreast of


technological developments like
electronic mail and other
alternative ways of doing your job.
You should evaluate the
performance of your vendors. You
should also evaluate the
performance of other groups in the
organization to which you belong.
Does some other group (like the
traffic department) affect how well
you can do your work? Can that
group meet your needs?


Once you have established what
constitutes your environment, you
need to examine it in two time
frames— now, and sometime in the
future, let's say in a year. The


questions then become: What do
my customers want from me now?
Am I satisfying them? What will
they expect from me one year from
now? You need to focus on the
difference between what your
environment demands from you
now and what you expect it to
demand from you a year from now.
Such a difference analysis is crucial,
because if your current activities
satisfy the current demands placed
on your business, anything more
and new should be undertaken to
match this difference. How you
react to this difference is in fact the
key outcome of the planning


process.


Should you at this stage consider
what practical steps you can
actually take to handle matters? No,
that will just confuse the issue.
What would happen to a factory, for
instance, if the marketing
organization adjusted its demand
forecast on the basis of its own
assessment of the manufacturing
unit's ability to deliver? If
marketing knew they could sell 100
widgets per month but thought that
manufacturing could only deliver
ten, and so submitted a demand
forecast of ten units, manufacturing
would never tool up to satisfy the


real demand.


STEP 2—PRESENT STATUS


The second step of planning is to
determine your present status. You
do this by listing your present
capabilities and the projects you
have in the works. As you account
for them, be sure to use the same
terms, or "currency," in which you
stated demand. For instance, if your
demand is listed in terms of
completed product designs, your
work-in-process should be listed as
partially completed product designs.
You also need to look at timing;
namely, when will these projects


come out of your "pipeline"? You
must ask yourself, will every project
now moving through be completed?
Chances are, no, some will get
scrapped or aborted, and you have
to factor this into your forecasted
output. Statistically, in
semiconductor manufacturing, only
some 80 percent of the material
started actually gets finished.
Similarly, while it is impossible to
be precise in every case, it is
prudent to factor in some
percentage of loss for managerial
projects as well.


STEP 3—WHAT TO DO TO CLOSE
THE GAP


The final step of planning consists
of undertaking new tasks or
modifying old ones to close the gap
between your environmental
demand and what your present
activities will yield. The first
question is, What do you need to do
to close the gap? The second is,
What can you do to close the gap?
Consider each question separately,
and then decide what you actually
will do, evaluating what effect your
actions will have on narrowing the
gap, and when. The set of actions
you decide upon is your strategy.


Much confusion exists between
what is strategy and what is tactics.


Although the distinction is rarely of
practical significance, here's one
that might be useful. As you
formulate in words what you plan
to do, the most abstract and general
summary of those actions


meaningful to you is your strategy.
What you'll do to implement the
strategy is your tactics. Frequently,
a strategy at one managerial level is
the tactical concern of the next
higher level. Let's return to our
mailroom. Assume that the
manager of corporate
communications has decided to

install electronic mail service
between all manufacturing plants.


This is his strategy—a plan of action
to improve communications
capability between plants. The
mailroom manager then has to do
certain things to provide service
when electronic mail equipment is
put in place. For instance, his
strategy may be to install printers in
the mailroom and set up a service
to deliver printed copies throughout
the building. The mailroom
manager's strategy is the
communications manager's tactics.


SOME EXAMPLES


As he defined his present
environment and status, Bruce, an


Intel marketing manager, found
that he had only three people in his
department who could possibly
handle a huge inventory of projects.
As he looked at his desired future
status, he concluded that every
single one of the projects had to be
completed. Not finishing everything
would result in significant extra
cost and far more ettort later. Bruce
was faced with a genuine dilemma,
especially since the budget kept him
from hiring more people. He
realized that the best he could do
was to narrow the gap a bit—getting
the projects and his group's capacity
to complete them to converge. A


complete match was impossible.


Bruce decided to move as many
noncritical tasks as possible to
other groups in the company-—
groups less qualified for them than
his own but also less busy. He also
made arrangements with his
manager to bring a summer student
on board to help with some easily
definable tasks, and then set
himself up to monitor the per
