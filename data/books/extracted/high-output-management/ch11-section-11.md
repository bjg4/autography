managers reporting to me had had a
superb year. All output measures
were excellent, sales increased,
profit margins were good, the
products worked—you could hardly
even think of giving anything but a
superior review to the person in
charge. Yet I had some misgivings.
Turnover in his group was higher
than it should have been, and his
people were grumbling too much.
There were other such straws in the
wind, but who could give credence
to elusive signs when tangible,
measurable performance was so
outstanding? So the manager got a
very positive review.


The next year his organization took
a nose dive. Sales growth
disappeared, profitability declined,
product development was delayed,
and the turmoil among his
subordinates deepened. As I
prepared the next review of this
manager, I struggled to sort out
what had happened. Did the
manager's performance deteriorate
as suddenly as his organization's
output measures indicated? What
was going on? I concluded that in
fact the manager's performance was
improving in the second year, even
as things seemed to go to hell. The
problem was that his performance


had not been good a year earlier.
The output indicators merely
represented work done years ago—
the light from distant stars, as it
were—which was still holding up.
The time offset between the
manager's work and the output of
his organization was just about a
year. Greatly embarrassed, I
regretfully concluded that the
superior rating I had given him was
totally wrong. Trusting the internal
measures, I should have had the
judgment and courage to give the
manager a much lower rating than I
did in spite of the excellent output
indicators that did not reflect the


year under review.


The time offset between activity
and output can also work the other
way around. In the early years of
Intel, I was called upon to review
the performance of a subordinate
who was setting up a production
facility from scratch. It had not
manufactured anything as yet, but
of


course the review could not wait for
tangible output. I had had no prior
experience supervising someone
who did not have a record of

concrete output. Here I gave my
subordinate credit for doing well,


even though output remained
uncertain. As managers, we are
really called upon to judge
performance, not just to see and
record it when it's in plain sight.


Finally, as you review a manager,
should you be judging his
performance or the performance of
the group under his supervision?
You should be doing both.
Ultimately what you are after is the
performance of the group, but the
manager is there to add value in
some way. You need to determine
what that is. You must ask: Is he
doing anything with his group? Is
he hiring new people? Is he training


the people he has, and doing other
things that are likely to improve the
output of the team in the future?
The most difficult issues in
determining a professional's
performance will be based on
asking questions and making
judgments of this sort.


One big pitfall to be avoided is the
"potential trap." At all times you
should force yourself to assess
performance, not potential By
"potential" I mean form rather than
substance, I was once asked to
approve the performance review of
a general manager whose
supervisor rated him highly for the


year. The manager was responsible
for a business unit that lost money,
missed its revenue forecast month
after month, slipped engineering
schedules, and in general showed
poor output and internal measures
over the year. Accordingly, I could
not approve the review. Whereupon
his supervisor said, "But he is an
outstanding general manager. He is
knowledgeable and han~ dies
himself well. It's his organization
that did not do well, not the
manager himself!" This cut no ice
with me because the performance
rating of a manager cannot be
higher than the one we would


accord to his organization! It is very
important to assess actual
performance, not appearances; real
output, not good form. Had the
manager been given a high


rating, Intel would have signaled to
all at the company that to do well,
you must "act" like a good manager,
talk like one, and emulate one—but
you don't need to perform like one.


A decision to promote is often
linked, as it should be, to the
performance review. We must
recognize that no action
communicates a manager's values
toan organization more clearly and


loudly than his choice of whom he
promotes. By elevating someone,
we are, in effect, creating role
models for others in our
organization. The old saying has it
that when we promote" our best
salesman and make him a manager,
we ruin a good salesman and get a
bad manager. But if we think about
it, we see we have no choice but to
promote the good salesman. Should
our worst salesman get the job?
When we promote our best, we are
saying to our subordinates that
performance is what counts.


It is hard enough for us to assess
our subordinates' performance, but


we must also try to improve it. No
matter how well a subordinate has
done his job, we can always find
ways to suggest improvement,
something about which a manager
need not feel embarrassed. Blessed
with 20/20 hindsight, we can
compare what the subordinate did
against what he might have done,
and the variance can tell both of us
how to do things better in the
future.


Delivering the Assessment


There are three L's to keep in mind
when delivering a review: Level,
listen, and leave yourself out.


You must level with your
subordinate—the credibility and
integrity of the entire system
depend on your being totally frank.
And don't be surprised to find that
praising someone in a
straightforward fashion can be just
as hard as criticizing him without
embarrassment.


The word "listen" has special
meaning here. The aim


of communication is to transmit
thoughts from the brain of person A
to the brain of person B. Thoughts
in the head of A are first converted
into words, which are enunciated


and via sound waves reach the ear
of B; as nerve impulses they travel
to his brain, where they are
transformed back into thoughts and
presumably kept. Should person A
use a tape recorder to confirm the
words used in the review? The
answer is an emphatic no. Words
themselves are nothing but a
means; getting the right thought
communicated is the end. Perhaps
B has become so emotional that he
can't understand something that
would be perfectly clear to anyone
else. Perhaps B has become so
preoccupied trying to formulate
answers that he can't really listen


and get A's message. Perhaps B has
tuned out and as a defense is
thinking of going fishing. All of
these possibilities can and do occur,
and all the more so when A's
message is laden with conflict.


How then can you be sure you are
being truly heard? What techniques
can you employ? Is it enough to
have your subordinate paraphrase
your words? I don't think so. What
you must do is employ all of your
sensory capabilities. To make sure
you're being heard, you should
watch the person you are talking to.
Remember, the more complex the
issue, the more prone


communication is to being lost.
Does your subordinate give
appropriate responses to what you
are saying? Does he allow himself
to receive your message? If his
responses —verbal and nonverbal—
do not completely assure you that
what you've said has gotten
through, it is your responsibility to
keep at it until you are satisfied that
you have been heard and
understood.


This is what I mean by listening:
employing your entire arsenal of
sensory capabilities to make certain
your points are being properly
interpreted by your subordinate's


brain. All the intelligence and good
faith used to prepare your review
will produce nothing unless this
occurs. Your tool, to say it again, is
total listening.


Every good classroom teacher
works in the same way. He knows
when what he is saying is being
understood by his students. If it
isn't, he takes heed and explains
things again or explains things in a
different way. All of us have had
professors who lectured by looking
at the blackboard, mumbling to it,
and carefully avoiding direct eye
contact with the class. The reason:
knowing that their presentation was


murky and incomprehensible, these
teachers looked away from their
audience to avoid confirming
visually what they already knew. So
don't imitate your worst professors
while delivering performance
reviews. Listen with all your might
to make sure your subordinate is
receiving your message, and don't
stop delivering it until you are
satisfied that he is.


The third L is "leave yourself out."
It is very important for you to
understand that the performance
review is about and for your
subordinate. So your own
insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or


whatever should be kept out of it.
At issue are the subordinate's
problems, not the supervisor's, and
it is the subordinate's day in court.
Anyone called upon to assess the
performance of another person is
likely to have strong emotions
before and during the review, just
as actors have stage fright. You
should work to control these
emotions sodiat they don't affect
your task, though they will well up
no matter how many reviews you've
given.


Let us now consider three types of
performance reviews.


"On the One Hand . . . On the Other

Hand ..."


Most reviews probably fall into this
category, containing both positive
and negative assessments. Common
problems here include
superficiality, cliches, and laundry
lists of unrelated observations. All
of these will leave your subordinate
bewildered and will hardly improve
his future performance, the review's
basic purpose. Let me


suggest some ways to help you
deliver this type of review.


The key is to recognize that your


subordinate, like most people, has
only a finite capacity to deal with
facts, issues, and suggestions. You
may possess seven truths about his
performance, but if his capacity is
only four, at best you'll waste your
breath on the other three. At worst
you will have left him with a case of
sensory overload, and he will go
away without getting anything out
of the review. The fact is that a
person can only absorb so many
messages at one time,' especially
when they deal with his own
performance. The purpose of the
review is not to cleanse your system
of all the truths you may have


observed about your subordinate,
but to improve his performance. So
here less may very well be more.


How can you target a few key areas?
First, consider as many aspects of
your subordinate's performance as
possible. You should scan material
such as progress reports,
performance against quarterly
objectives, and one-on-one meeting
notes. Then sit down with a blank
piece of paper. As you consider your
subordinate's performance, write
everything down on the paper. Do
not edit in your head. Get
everything down, knowing that
doing so doesn't commit you to do


anything. Things major, minor, and
trivial can be included in no
particular order. When you have
run out of items, you can put all of
your supporting documentation

away.


Now, from your worksheet, look for
relationships between the various
items listed. You will probably
begin to notice that certain items
are different manifestations of the
same phenomenon, and that there
may be some indications why a
certain strength or weakness exists.
When you find such relationships,
you can start calling them
"messages" for the subordinate. At


this point, your worksheet might
look something like that shown on
the next page. Now, again from your
worksheet, begin to


draw conclusions and specific
examples to support them Once
your list of messages has been
compiled, ask your-sett it your
subordinate will be able to
remember all of the messages you
have chosen to deliver. If not, you

must


Zjf,^ ™ imp ? rtant ones Remember, what you cou dn t
include in this review, you can
probably take ud m me next one.

review, right? Wrong. When you are
using the worksheet, sometimes


you come up with a message that
will startle you. So what do you do?
You're faced with either delivering
the message or not, but if the
purpose of the review is to improve
your subordinate's performance,
you must deliver it. Preferably, a
review should not contain any
surprises, but if you uncover one,
swallow hard and bring it up.


On pages 200-201 you'll find an "on
the one hand, on the other hand"
kind of performance review. It was
written to correspond to the
worksheet shown opposite. I have
annotated it to call attention to
some of the things we discussed in
this chapter.


The Blast


With a little soul-searching, you
may come to realize that you have a
major performance problem on
your hands. You have a subordinate
who, unless turned around, could
get fired. To deal with the problem,
you and your subordinate will likely


go through stages commonly
experienced in problem-solving of
all kinds and particularly in conflict
resolution. These are shown on
page 194. You'll find these occurring
definitely during and possibly after
the "blast" review, which is basically
an exercise of resolving conflict
about a big performance problem.


A poor performer has a strong
tendency to ignore his problem.
Here a manager needs facts and
examples so that he can
demonstrate its reality. Progress of
some sort is made when the
subordinate actively denies the
existence of a problem rather than


ignoring it passively, as before.
Evidence can overcome resistance
here as well, and we enter the third
stage, when the subordinate admits
that there is a problem, but
maintains it is not his problem.
Instead he will blame others, a
standard defense mechanism. Using
this defense, he can continue to
avoid the responsibility and burden
of remedying the situation.


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


Find solution


Assume responsibility


Blame others


Denv


Ignore


The stages of problem-solving: The
transition from blaming others to
assuming responsibility is an
emotional step.


These three steps usually follow
one another in fairly rapid
succession. But things tend to get
stuck at the blame-others stage. If
your subordinate does have a
problem, there's no way of resolving
it if he continues to blame it on


others. He has to take the biggest
step: namely assuming
responsibility. He has to say not
only that there is a problem but that
it is his problem. This is fateful,
because it means work: "If it is my
problem, I have to do something
about it. If I have to do something,
it is likely to be unpleasant and will
definitely mean a lot of work on my
part." Once responsibility has been
assumed, however, finding the
solution is relatively easy. This is
because the move from blaming
others to assuming responsibility
constitutes an emotional step, while
the move from assuming


responsibility to finding the
solution is an intellectual one, and
the latter is easier.


It is the reviewer's job to get the
subordinate to move through all of
the stages to that of assuming
responsibility, though finding the
solution should be a shared task.


The supervisor should keep track of
what stage things are in. If the
supervisor wants to go on to find
the solution when the subordinate
is still denying or blaming others,
nothing can happen. Knowing
where you are will help you both
move through the stages together.


In the end, there are three possible
outcomes, One 5 the subordinate
accepts your assessment and your
recommended cure, and commits
himself to take it. Two, he may
disagree completely with your
assessment but still accepts your
cure. Three, the subordinate
disagrees with your assessment and
does not commit himself to do w r
hat you've recommended. As the
supervisor, which of these three
should you consider acceptable
resolutions to the problem?


I feel very strongly that any
outcome that includes a
commitment to action is acceptable.


Complex issues do not lend
themselves easily to universal
agreement. If your subordinate says
he's committed to change things,
you have to assume he's sincere.
The key word here is accept-able. It
is certainly more desirable for you
and your subordinate to agree about
the problem and the solution,
because that will make you feel that
he will enthusiastically work toward
remedying it. So up to a point you
should try to get your subordinate
to agree with you. But if you can't,
accept his commitment to change
and go on. Don't confuse emotional
comfort with operational need. To


make things work, people do not
need to side with you; you only
need them to commit themselves to
pursue a course of action that has
been decided upon. There seems to
be something not quite nice about
expecting a person to walk down a
path he'd rather not be on. But on
the job we are after a person's
performance, not our psychological
comfort.


I learned the distinction between
the two during one of the first
reviews I had to give, I was trying
very hard to persuade my
subordinate to see things my way.
He simply would not go along with


me and finally said to me, "Andy,


you will never convince me, but
why do you insist on wanting to
convince me? I've already said I will
do what you say." I shut up,
embarrassed, not knowing why. It
took me a long time before I
realized I was embarrassed because
my insistence had a lot to do with
making me feel better and litde to
do with the running of the business.


If it becomes clear that you are not
going to get your subordinate past
the blame-others stage, you will
have to assume the formal role of
the supervisor, endowed with


position power, and say, "This is
what I, as your boss, am instructing
you to do. I understand that you do
not see it my way. You may be right
or I may be right. But I am not only
empowered, I am required by the
organization for which we both
work to give you instructions, and
this is what I want you to do ..." And
proceed to secure your
subordinate's commitment to the
course of action you want and
thereafter monitor his performance
against that commitment.


Recently one of my subordinates
wrote a review that I considered
superficial, lacking analysis and


depth. My subordinate, after some
discussion, agreed with my
assessment, but he considered the
issue not important enough, as he
put it, to spend time rewriting the
review. After more spirited
discussion, we remained
deadlocked. Finally, I took a deep
breath and said to him, "Look, I
understand that you don't consider
it worth your time to do it. But I
want you to do it." I added that "I
guess there is a basic difference
between us. The integrity of the
performance review system is just
more important to me than it is to
you. That is why I have to insist."


He looked back at me and after a
moment simply said, "Okay." He
thought I was out in left field and
resented the fact that I made him
spend time on something he
thought was unimportant, but he
committed himself to redo the
review, and, in fact, he did it well.
His subordinate ended up getting
the reworked, much more thorough
and thoughtful review, and the fact
that his review was rewritten


without the agreement of my
subordinate made no difference to

him.


Reviewing the Ace


After trying to establish the
principles of performance appraisal
with a group of about twenty
middle managers, I asked them to
take a review they had once
received and to analyze it according
to our new criteria. The results were
not what I expected, but I did learn
from them.


This group consisted of achievers,
and their ratings were mostly very
high. The reviews were
exceptionally well written, much
better than the average at Intel.
However, for content, they tended
to be retrospective assessments,
analyses of what the subordinate


had done in the course of the prior
year. Even though their key purpose
was to improve the subordinate's
future performance, a majority of
the reviews made little or no
attempt to define what the
subordinate needed to do to
improve his performance or even to
maintain his current level. It seems
that for an achiever the supervisor's
effort goes into determining and
justifying the judgment of the
superior performance, while giving
little attention to how he could do
even better. But for a poor
performer, the supervisor tends to
concentrate heavily on ways he can


improve performance, providing
detailed and elaborate "corrective
action programs," step-by-step
affairs meant to ensure that the
marginal employee can pull himself
up to meet minimum requirements.


I think we have our priorities
reversed. Shouldn't we spend more
time trying to improve the
performance of our stars? After all,
these people account for a
disproportionately large share of
the work in any organization. Put
another way, concentrating on the
stars is a high-leverage activity: if
they get better, the impact on group
output is very great indeed.


We all have a hard time savins:
things that are critical,


whether we're talking to a superior
employee or a marginal one. We
must keep in mind, however, that
no matter how stellar a person's
performance level is, there is always
room for improvement. Don't
hesitate to use the 20/20 hindsight
provided by the review to show
anyone, even an ace, how he might
have done better.


Other Thoughts and Practices


Is it a good idea to ask the
subordinate to prepare some kind


of a self-review before being
reviewed by his supervisor? Let me
answer the question this way. Your
own review is obviously important
to you, and you really want to know
how your supervisor sees your
year's work. If you prepare a review
and give it to your supervisor, and
he simply changes the format,
retypes it, gives you a superior
rating, and then hands it back to
you, how will you feel? Probably
cheated. If you have to tell your
supervisor about your
accomplishments, he obviously
doesn't pay much attention to what
you are doing. Reviewing the


performance of subordinates is a
formal act of leadership. If
supervisors permit themselves to be
prompted in one way or another,
their leadership and their capacity
for it will begin to appear false. So
the integrity of the
supervisors'judgment here must be
preserved at all costs, and they
must commit themselves through
an up-front judgment of their
subordinates' performance if the
health and vitality of the review
process are to be maintained.


What about asking your
subordinate to evaluate your
performance as his supervisor? I


think this might be a good idea. But
you should make it clear to your
subordinate that it's your job to
assess his performance, while his
assessment of you has only
advisory status. The point is, he is
not your leader; you are his. And
under no circumstances should you
pretend that you and your
subordinates are equal during
performance reviews.


Should you deliver the written
review before, during, or after the
face-to-face discussion? I have tried
it all three ways. Let's consider
some of the pros and cons of each.
What happens if you have the


review first and then give your
subordinate what you've written
later? Upon reading it, the
subordinate may find a phrase that
he didn't "hear" earlier and blow up
over it. What about delivering the
written review during the
discussion? One manager told me
that he gives the subordinate a copy
of the review and tells him to read
the first several paragraphs, which
they then discuss. Grouping the
paragraphs, supervisor and
subordinate work their way through
the appraisal. I can see a problem
with this. How can a supervisor ask
a subordinate to stop at paragraph


three when he is so eager to read
the rest of what he's got? Another
manager told me that he reads the
written review to his subordinate to
try to control the session. But here,
too, the subordinate is left eager to
know what comes next and might
not pay attention to what is really
being said. Also, when your
subordinate is given a written
review during the discussion, he
won't have the time to think about
what it says and is likely to walk
away muttering to himself, "I
should have said this in response,
and I should have said that." For a
good meeting of minds, your


subordinate should have time to

work out his reactions to what's in
the review 7 .


In my experience, the best thing to
do is to give your subordinate the
written review sometime before the

face-to-face discussion. He can then
read the whole thing privately and
digest it. He can react or overreact
and then look at the "messages"
again. By the time the two of you
get together, he will be much more
prepared, both emotionally and
rationally*


Preparing and delivering a
performance assessment is one of


the hardest tasks you'll have to
perform as a manager. The best way
to learn how to do one is to think
critically about the reviews you
yourself have received.

THIS REVIEW PERIOD:


The production planning process


was significantly changed this -year.
Sites were well coordinated, and all
the administrative activities were
efficiently done.


EVALUATION: (AREAS OF
STRENGTHS, AREAS FOR
IMPROVEMENTS)


John transferred to Materials
Support in early February. The
production planning process was in
some difficulties at the time he
joined the group. jfc>hn got up to
speed very quickly and was able to
take over the job from his
predecessor very effectively


In the manufacturing specifications
area, John's efforts have been far
less successful to date. John puts
effort Into these areas, but the
results have not been satisfactory I
think that the problem has two

causes.


-John has a hard time defining
clear, concise, and specific goals. A
clear example of this is his difficulty
setting good objectives


^ and key results. Another example
is the mushy conclusion of the
manufacturing specification system
review in March. We still don't have

a clear definitive statement of


where the spec system is heading
and how it is going to get there.
Without specific goals, one can very
easily fall into the trap of "working
orf* things without reaching the
objectives-which leads to the
second issue.


-I feel that John is easily satisfied
that having a meeting on a


- subject constitutes progress. This
happened, for example^n the


area of training associated with
manufacturing specs. John


Compliments need examples, too.' "


Attempt to show hmi-lo improve
performance


Two levels of management plus
personnel required, for checks and
balances


should spend more effort prior to
each meeting and define what
specific results he wants to
accomplish with it.


lohn's prior finance background has
really helped in a variety of work
areas. For example, John
voluntarily helped the Purchasing
'group sort out some of their
finance problems-an effort over and


above the call of duty.


John would like to be promoted to
the next management level. This
will not happen at this time, but I
am satisfied that his capabilities
will allow him to eventually be
promoted. Before that happens,
however, John has to be able to
take complex projects, like the
manufacturing spec system, and
show re s u l ts. This will require
clear and concise breakdown of
problems, identification of goals,
and establishment of the way to
achieve those goals. John, 'for the
most part, will have to achieve this
on his own. While I will help when


needed, John has to be the primary
driver. Only when he shows that he
is capable of independent work
along these lines can he be
promoted.


In summarv, John is capable of
doing his current job. I also realiyx
the difficulty John has had in
changing from the finance
environment to a manufacturing
environment. I will continue to try
to help him-particularly in the areas
of goal setting and defining ways of
accomplishing his tasks. John's
performance in Materials Support is
rated as "meets requirements"-a
rating he should definitely be able


to improve.

And if you've been lucky, the
tradition of good performance
reviews has been handed from
supervisor to subordinate, which
has helped to maintain the integrity
of the system in your company.
Nevertheless, people constantly
need to be prodded into doing a


good job of reviewing. Each year I
read something like a hundred
evaluations, all of those written by
my own subordinates and a random
selection from throughout Intel. I
comment on them and send them
