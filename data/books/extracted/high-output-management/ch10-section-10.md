management-by-objectives system
are linked to the performance of the
individual, they will gauge his
degree


of success and will enhance his
progress. An obvious and very
important responsibility of a
manager is to steer his people away
from irrelevant and meaningless
rewards, such as office size or
decor, and toward relevant and
significant ones. The most
important form of such taskrelevant feedback is the
performance review every
subordinate should receive from his
supervisor. More about this later.


Fear


In physiological and security/safety
need-dominated motivation, one
fears the loss of life or limb or loss
of job or liberty. Does fear have a
place in the esteem or selfactualized modes? It does, but here
it becomes the fear of failure. But is
that a positive or negative source of
motivation? It can be either. Given
a specific task, fear of failure can
spur a person on, but if it becomes a
preoccupation, a person driven by a
need to achieve will simply become
conservative. Let's think back to the
ring tossers. If a person got an
electrical shock each time he threw


a ring and missed, soon enough he
would walk over to the peg and drop
the ring from directly over it to
eliminate the pain associated with
failure.


In general, in the upper levels of
motivation, fear is not something
coming from the outside. It is
instead fear of not satisfying
yourself that causes you to back off.
You cannot stay in the selfactualized mode if you're always
worried about failure.


The Sports Analogy


We've studied motivation to try to


understand what makes people
want to work so that as managers
we can elicit peak performance
from our subordinates—their
"personal best." Of course, what we
are really after is the


performance of the organization as
a whole, but that depends on how
skilled and motivated the people
within it are. Thus, our role as
managers is, first, to train the
individuals (to move them along
the horizontal axis shown in the
illustration on page 158), and,
second, to bring them to the point
where self-actualization motivates
them, because once there, their


motivation will be self-sustaining
and limitless.


Is there a systematic way to lead
people to self-actualization? For an
answer, let's ask another question.
Why does a person who is not
terribly interested in his work at the
office stretch himself to the limit
running a marathon? What makes
him run? He is trying to beat other
people or the stopwatch. This is a
simple model of self-actualization,
wherein people will exert
themselves to previously
undreamed heights, forcing
themselves to run farther or faster,
while their efforts fill barrels with


sweat. They will do this not for
money, but just to beat the
distance, the clock, or other people.
Consider what made Joe Frazier

box:


It astounds Joe Frazier that anyone
has to ask why he fights. "This is
what I do. I am a fighter," he says.
"It's my job. I'm just doing my job."
Joe doesn't deny the attractiveness
of money. "Who wants to work for
nothing?" But there are things more
important than money. "I don't
need to be a starjbecause I don't
need to shine. But I do need to be a
boxer, because that's what I am. It's
as simple as that."


Imagine how productive our
country would become if managers
could endow all work with the
characteristics of competitive
sports.


To try to do this, we must first
overcome cultural prejudice. Our
society respects someone's
throwing himself into sports, but
anybody who works very long hours
is regarded as sick, a workaholic. So
the prejudices of the


majority say that sports are good
and fun, but work is drudgery, a
necessary evil, and in no way a
source of pleasure.


That makes the cliche apply: if you
can't beat them, join them—endow
work with the characteristics of
competitive sports. And the best
way to get that spirit into the
workplace is to establish some rules
of the game and ways for employees
to measure themselves. Eliciting
peak performance means going up
against something or somebody. Let
me give you a simple example. For
years the performance of the Intel
facilities maintenance group, which
is responsible for keeping our
buildings clean and neat, was
mediocre, and no amount of
pressure or inducement seemed to


do any good. We then initiated a
program in which each building's
upkeep was periodically scored by a
resident senior manager, dubbed a
"building czar." The score was then
compared with those given the
other buildings. The condition of all
of them dramatically improved
almost immediately. Nothing else
was done; people did not get more
money or other rewards. What they
did get was a racetrack, an arena of
competition. If your work is
facilities maintenance, having your
building receive the top score is a
powerful source of motivation. This
is key to the manager's approach


and involvement: he has to see the
work as it is seen by the people who
do that work every day and then
create indicators so that his

subordinates can watch their
"racetrack" take shape.


Conversely, of course, when the
competition is removed, motivation
associated with it vanishes.
Consider the example of a
newspaper columnist reflecting on
his past. This journalist "thrived on
beating the competition in the
column, and his pleasure in his
work began to wane after [his paper
and the competitive paper] merged.
Til never forget that day of the


merger/the columnist said. 1
walked out to get the train, and I
just thought: There isn't anyone
else to beat.' "


Comparing our work to sports may
also teach us how to cope with
failure. As noted, one of the big
impediments to a fully committed,
highly motivated state of mind is
preoccupation with failure. Yet we
know that in any competitive sport,
at least 50 percent of all matches
are lost. All participants know that
from the outset, and yet rarely do
they give up at any stage of a

contest.


The role of the manager here is also
clear: it is that of the coach. First,
an ideal coach takes no personal
credit for the success of his team,
and because of that his players trust
him. Second, he is tough on his
team. By being critical, he tries to
get the best performance his team
members can provide. Third, a good
coach was likely a good player
himself at one time. And having
played the game well, he also
understands it well.


Turning the workplace into a
playing field can turn our
subordinates into "athletes"
dedicated to performing at the limit


of their capabilities—the key to
making our team consistent
winners.

Task-Relevant Maturity


I'll say again that a manager's most
important responsibility is to elicit
top performance from his
subordinates. Assuming we
understand what motivates an
employee, the question becomes: Is
there a single best management
style, one approach that will work
better than all others? Many have
looked for that optimum.


Considering the issue historically,
the management style most in favor
seems to have changed to parallel
the theory of motivation espoused
at the time. At the turn of the
century, ideas about work were
simple. People were told what to do,
and if they did it, they were paid; if
they did not, they were fired. The
corresponding leadership style was
crisp and hierarchical: there were
those who gave orders and those
who took orders and executed them
without question. In the 1950's,
management theory shifted toward
a humanistic set of beliefs that held
that there was a nicer way to get


people to work. The favored
leadershio stvle changed
accordingly. Finally, as university
behavioral science departments
developed and grew, the theories of
motivation and leadership became
subjects of carefully controlled
experiments. Surprisingly, none of
the early intuitive presumptions
could be borne out: the hard
findings simply would not show
that one style of leader

ship was better than another. It was
hard to escape the conclusion that
no optimal management style
existed.


My own observations bear this out.
At Intel we fre-quendy rotate
middle managers from one group to
another in order to broaden their
experience. These groups tend to be
similar in background and in the
type of work that they do, although
their output tends to vary greatly.
Some managers and their groups
demonstrate themselves to be
higher producers; others do not.
The result of moving the managers
about is often surprising. Neither
the managers nor the groups
maintain the characteristic of being
either high-producing or lowproducing as the managers are


switched around. The inevitable
conclusion is that high output is
associated with particular
combinations of certain managers
and certain groups of workers. This
also suggests that a given
managerial approach is not equally
effective under all conditions.


Some researchers in this field argue
that there is a fundamental variable
that tells you what the best
management style is in a particular
situation. That variable is the taskrelevant maturity (TRM) of the
subordinates, which is a
combination of the degree of their
achievement orientation and


readiness to take responsibility, as
well as their education, training,
and experience. Moreover, all this is
very specific to the task at hand,
and it is entirely possible for a
person or a group of people to have
a TRM that is high in one job but
low in another.


Let me give you an example of what
I mean. We re-cendy moved an
extremely productive sales manager
from the field into the plant, where
he was placed in charge of a factory
unit. The size and scope of the two
jobs were comparable, yet the
performance of the seasoned
manager deteriorated, and he


started to show the signs of
someone overwhelmed by his work.
What happened was that while the
personal maturity of the manager
obviously did not change, his taskrelevant maturity in the new job
was extremely low, since its
environment,


*74 HIGH OUTPUT
MANAGEMENT


content, and tasks were_all new to
him. In time he learned to cope, and
his TRM gradually increased. With
that, his performance began to
approach the outstanding levels he
had exhibited earlier, which was


why we promoted him in the first
place. What happened here should
have been totally predictable, yet we
were surprised: we confused the
manager's general competence and
maturity with his task-relevant
maturity.


Similarly, a person's TRM can be
very high given a certain level of
complexity, uncertainty, and
ambiguity, but if the pace of the job
accelerates or if the jobltself
abruptly changes, the TRM of that
individual will drop. It's a bit like a
person with many years' experience
driving on small country roads
being suddenly asked to drive on a


crowded metropolitan freeway. His
TRM driving his own car will drop
precipitously.


The conclusion is that varying
management styles are needed as
task-relevant maturity varies.
Specifically, when the TRM is low,
the most effective approach is one
that offers very precise and detailed
instructions, wherein the
supervisor tells the subordinate
what needs to be done, when, and
how: in other words, a highly
structured approach. As the TRM of
the subordinate grows, the most
effective style moves from the
structured to one more given to


communication, emotional support,
and encouragement, in which the
manager pays more attention to the
subordinate as an individual than to
thejask at hand. As the TRM
becomes even greater, the ettective
management style changes again.
Here the manager's involvement
should be kept to a minimum, and
should primarily consist of making
sure that the objectives toward
which the subordinate is working
are mutually agreed upon. But
regardless of what the TRM may be,
the manager should always monitor
a subordinate's work closely enough
to avoid surprises. The pres-^ce or


absence of monitoring, as we've
said before, is the difference
between a supervisor's delegating a
task and


abdicating it. The characteristics of
the effective management style for
the supervisor given the varying
degrees of TRM are summarized in
the table below.


A word of caution is in order: do not
make a value judgment and
consider a structured management
style less worthy than a
communication-oriented one. What

is "nice" or "not nice" should have
no place in how you think or what


you do. Remember, we are after
what is most effective.


The theory here parallels the
development of the relationship
between a parent and child. As the
child matures, the most effective
parental style changes, varying with
the "life-relevant maturity"—or age
—of the child. A parent needs to tell
a toddler not to touch things that he
might break or that might hurt him.
The child cannot understand that
the vase he wants to play with is an
irreplaceable heirloom, but he can
understand "no." As he grows older,
he begins to do things on his own
initiative, something the parent


wants to encourage while still

determines the effective

trying to keep him from injuring
himself. A parent might suggest, for
example, that his child give up his
tricycle for his first two-wheeler.
The parent will not simply send nim


out on his own, but will accompany
him to keep the bicycle from tipping
over while talking to him abouf
safety on the streets. As the child's
maturity continues to grow, the
parent can cut back on specific
instruction. When the child goes
out to ride his bicycle, the parent no
longer has to recite the litany of
safety rules. Finally, when the liferelevant maturity of the child is
hiffh enough, he leaves home and
perhaps goes away to college. At
this point the relationship between
parent and child will change again
as the parent merely monitors the
tuna's progress.


Should the child's environment
suddenly change to one where his
life-relevant maturity is inadequate
(for example, if he runs into severe
academic trouble*, the parent may
have to revert to a style used earlier.


As parental (or managerial)
supervision moves from structured
to communicating to monitoring,
the degree or structure governing
the behavior of the child (or"the
subordinate) does not really
change. A teenager knows it is not
safe to cross a busy interstate
highway on his bicy-oe an u the
parent no longer has to tell him not
to do it. Structure moves from being


externally imposed to being
internally given.


t If the parent (or supervisor)
imparted early on to the cnua (or
subordinate) the right way to do
things (the correct operational
values), later the child would be
likely to make decisions the way the
parent would In *act commonality
of operational values, priorities, and
preferences—how an organization
works together—is a must if the
progression in managerial style is to
occur. Without that commonality,
an organization can become easily
confused and lose its sense of
purpose Accordingly, the


responsibility for transmittine
common values rests squarely with
the supervisor. He Ts, after all


accountable for the output of the
people who report to him; then, too,
without a shared set of values a
supervisor cannot effectively
delegate. An associate of mine who
had always done an outstanding job
hired a junior person to handle
some old tasks, while he himself
took on some new ones. The
subordinate did poor work. My
associate's reaction: "He has to

make his own mistakes. That's how
he learns!" The problem with this is
that the subordinate's tuition is


paid by his customers. And that is
absolutely wrong. The
responsibility for teaching the
subordinate must be assumed by
his supervisor, and not paid for by
the customers of his organization,
internal or external.


Management Style and Managerial
Leverage


As supervisors, we should try to
raise the task-relevant maturity of
our subordinates as rapidly as
possible for obvious pragmatic
reasons. The appropriate
management style for an employee
with high TRM takes less time than


detailed, structured, supervision
requires. Moreover, once
operational values are learned and
TRM is high enough, the supervisor
can delegate tasks to the
subordinate, thus increasing his
managerial leverage. Finally, at the
highest levels of TRM, the
subordinate's training is
presumably complete, and
motivation is likely to come from
within, from self-actualization,
which is the most powerful source
of energy and effort a manager can
harness.


As we've learned, a person's TRM
depends on a specific working


environment. When that changes,
so will his TRM, as will his
supervisor's most effective
management style. Let's consider
an army encampment where
nothing ever happens. The sergeant
in command has come to know
each of his soldiers very well, and
by and large maintains an informal
relationship with them. The
routines are so well established that
he rarely has to tell


anyone what to do; appropriate to
the high TRM of the group, the
sergeant contents himself with
merely monitoring their activity.
One day a jeepload of the enemy


suddenly appears, coming over the
hill and shooting at the camp.
Instantly the sergeant reverts to a
structured, task-oriented leadership
style, barking orders at everyone,
telling each of his soldiers what to
do, when, and how. . .. After a while,
if these skirmishes continue and
the group keeps on fighting from
the same place for a couple of
months, this too will eventually
become routine. With that, the
TRM of the group for the new task
—fighting—will increase. The
sergeant can then gradually ease off
telling everybody what to do.


Put another way, a manager's ability


to operate in a style based on
communication and mutual
understanding depends on there
being enough time for it. Though
monitoring is on paper a manager's
most productive approach, we have
to work our way up to it in the real
world. Even if we achieve it, if
things suddenly change we have to
revert quickly to the what-whenhow mode.


That mode is one that we don't
think an enlightened manager
should use. As a result, we often
don't take it up until it is too late
and events overwhelm us. We
managers must learn to fight such


prejudices and regard any
management mode not as either
good or bad but rather as effective
or not effective, given the TRM of
our subordinates within a specific
working environment. This is why
researchers cannot find the single
best way for a manager to work. It
changes day by day and sometimes
hour by hour.


It's Not Easy to Be a Good Manager


Deciding the TRM of your
subordinates is not easy. Moreover,
even if a manager knows what the
TRM is, his personal preferences
tend to override the logical and


proper choice of management style.
For instance, even


if a manager sees that his
subordinate's TRM is "medium"
(see the table on page 175), in the
real world the manager will likely
opt for either the "structured" or
"minimal" style. In other words, we
want either to be fully immersed in
the work of our subordinates,
making their decisions, or to leave
them completely alone, not wanting
to be bothered.


Another problem here is a
manager's perception of himself.
We tend to see ourselves more as


communicators and delegators than
we really are, certainly much more
than do our subordinates. I tested
this conclusion by asking a group of
managers to assess the
management style of their
supervisors, and then by asking
those supervisors what they
thought their style was. Some 90
percent of the supervisors saw their
style as more communicating or
delegating than their subordinates'
view. What accounts for the large
discrepancy? It is partly because
managers think of themselves as
perfect delegators. But also,
sometimes a manager throws out


suggestions to a subordinate who
receives them as marching orders—
furthering the difference in
perceptions.


A manager once told me that his
supervisor definitely practiced an
effective communicating style with
him because they skied and drank
together. He was wrong. There is a
huge distinction between a social
relationship and a communicating
management style, which is a caring
involvement in the work of the
subordinate. Close relationships off
the job may help to create an
equivalent relationship on the job,
but they should not be confused.


Two people I knew had a
supervisor-subordinate
relationship. They spent one week
each year by themselves, fishing in
a remote area. When fishing, they
never talked about work—it being
tacitly understood that work was off
conversational limits. Oddly
enough, their work relationship
remained distant, their personal
friendship having no effect on it.


This brings us to the age-old
question of whether


friendship between supervisor and
subordinate is a good thing. Some
managers unhesitatingly assert that


they never permit social
relationships to develop with people
they work with. In fact, there are
pluses "and minuses here. If the
subordinate is a personal friend, the
supervisor can move into a
communicating management style
quite easily, but the what-whenhow mode becomes harder to revert
to when necessary. It's unpleasant
to give orders to a friend. I've seen
several instances where a
supervisor had to make a
subordinate-friend toe a
disciplinary line. In one case, a
friendship was destroyed; in
another, the supervisor's action


worked out because the subordinate
felt, thanks to the strength of the
social relationship, that the
supervisor was looking out for his
(the subordinate's) professional
interests.


Everyone must decide for himself
what is professional and
appropriate here. A test might be to
imagine yourself delivering a tough
performance review to your friend.
Do you cringe at the thought? If so,
don't make friends at work. If your
stomach remains unaffected, you
are likely to be someone whose
personal relationships will
strengthen work relationships.

Performance Appraisal:


Manager as Judge


and Jury


Why Bother?


Why are performance reviews a part
of the management system of most
organizations? And why do we
review the performance of our
subordinates? I posed both
questions to a group of middle
managers and got the following

responses:


to assess the subordinate's work


to improve performance


to motivate


to provide feedback to a
subordinate


to justify raises


to reward performance


to provide discipline


to provide work direction


to reinforce the company culture


Next, I asked the group to imagine
themselves to be a supervisor giving
a review to a subordinate, and asked
them what their feelings were.
Some of the answers:


pride anger anxiety


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


discomfort


guilt


empathy/concern


embarrassment


frustration


Finally, I asked the same group to
think back to some of the
performance reviews they had
received and asked what, if
anything, was wrong with them.
Their answers were quick and

many:


review comments too general


mixed messages (inconsistent with
rating or dollar


raise) no indication of how to
improve negatives avoided
supervisor didn't know my work
only recent performance considered
surprises


This should tell you that giving
performance reviews is a very
complicated and difficult business
and that we, managers, don't do an
especially good job at it.


The fact is that giving such reviews
is the single most important form
of task-relevant feedback we as
supervisors can provide. It is how
we assess our subordinates' level of
performance and how we deliver
that assessment to them
individually. It is also how we
allocate the rewards-promotions,
dollars, stock options, or whatever
we may use. As we saw earlier, the
review will influence a


subordinate's performance—
positively or negatively—for a long
time, which makes the appraisal
one of the manager's highestleverage activities. In short, the
review is an extremely powerful
mechanism, and it is little wonder
that opinions and feelings about it
are strong and diverse.


But what is its fundamental
purpose? Though all of the
responses given to my questions are
correct? there is one that is more
important than any of the others: it
is


to improve the subordinate's


performance. The review is usually
dedicated to two things: first, the
skill level of the subordinate, to
determine what skills are missing
and to find ways to remedy that
lack; and second, to intensify the
subordinate's motivation in order to
get him on a higher performance
curve for the same skill level (see
the illustration on page 158).


The review process also represents
the most formal type of
institutionalized leadership. It is
the only time a manager is
mandated to act as judge and jury:
we managers are required by the
organization that employs us to


make a judgment regarding a fellow
worker and then to deliver that
judgment to him, face to face.


A supervisor's responsibility here is
obviously very significant. What
preparation have we had to do the
job properly? About the only thing I
can think of is that as subordinates
we've been on the receiving end.
But in general our society values
avoiding confrontation. Even the
word "argument" is frowned upon,
something I learned many years ago
when I first came to this country
from Hungary. In Hungarian, the
word "argument" is frequently used
to describe a difference of opinion.


When I began to learn English and
used the word "argument," I would
be corrected, as people would say,
"Oh no, you don't mean 'argument,'
you mean 'debate,' " or "you mean
'discussion.' " Among friends and
peers you are not supposed to
discuss politics, religion, or
anything that might possibly
produce a difference of opinion and
a conflict. Football scores,
gardening, and the weather are
okay. We are taught that the wellmannered skirt potentially
emotional issues. The point is,
delivering a good performance
review is really a unique act given


both our cultural background and
our professional training.


Don't think for a moment that
performance reviews should be
confined to large organizations.
They should be part of managerial
practice in organizations of any


size and kind, from the insurance
agent with two office assistants to
administrators in education,
government, and nonprofit
organizations. The long and short of
it: if penormance matters in your
operation, performance reviews are
absolutely necessary.


Two aspects of the review—
assessing performance and
delivering the assessment—are
equally difficult Let's look at each in
a little more detail.


Assessing Performance


Determining the performance of
professional emolovees in a strictly
objective manner is very difficult
because tttere is obviously no cutand-dried way to measure and
characterize a professional
employee's work completely, most
jobs involve activities that are not
reflected by output in the time
period covered by the review. Yet


we have to give such activities
appropriate weight as we assess a
person s performance, even though
we know we won't necessarily be
objective, since only output can be
measured with true objectivity.
Anybody who supervises
professionals, therefore, walks a
tightrope: he needs to oe oojective,
but must not be afraid of using his
judgment, even though judgment is
by definition subiective. lo make an
assessment less difficult, a
supervisor s^omu ciarify in his own
mind in advance what it is that he
expects from a subordinate and
then attempt to judge wiietiier he


performed to expectations. The
biggest problem with most reviews
is that we don't usually define wnat
it is we want from our subordinates,
and, as noted earlier, if we don't
know what we want, we are surelv
nor going to get it.


Let's think back to our concept of
the managerial ^ black box. Using
it, we can characterize performance
uy output measures and internal
measures. The first represent the
output of the black box, and include
such thines as completing designs,
meeting sales quotas, or increasing


the yield in a production process—


things we can and should plot on
charts. The internal measures take
into account activities that go on
inside the black box: whatever is
being done to create output for the
period under review and also that
which sets the stage for the output
of future periods. Are we reaching
our current production goals in
such a way that tw r o months from
now w r e are likely to face a group
of disgruntled production
employees? Are we positioning and
developing people in the
organization in such a way that our
business can handle its tasks in the
future? Are we doing all of the


things that add up to a well-run
department? There is no strict
formula by which we can compare
the relative significance of output
measures and internal measures. In
a given situation, the proper
weighting could be 50/50, 90/10, or
10/90 and could even shift from
one month to the next. But at least

we should know which two
variables are being traded off
against each other,


A similar kind of trade-off also has
to be considered here: weighing
long-term-oriented against shortterm-oriented performance. An
engineer working on the design of a
product needs to complete the
project on a strict schedule to
generate revenue. He may also be
working on a design method that
will make it easier for others to
design similar products in the
future. The engineer obviously
needs both activities evaluated and

reviewed. Which is more
significant? A way to help weigh
questions like this is the idea of
"present value" used in finance:


how much will the future-oriented
activity pay back over time? And
how much is that worth today?


There is also a time factor to
consider. The subordinate's output
during the review period may have
all, some, or nothing to do with his
activities during the same period.
Accordingly, the supervisor should
look at the time offset between the
activity of the subordinate and the
output that results from that
activity. Let me explain what I
mean, because this is one lesson I
learned the hard


way. The organization of one of the
