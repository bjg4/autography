Introduction


Let me begin by telling you what
this book is not about. There's not a
sentence in it about bits and bytes,
RAMs and ROMs, or anything else
remotely technical or arcane, even
though Intel, where I work, is a
"high-tech," Silicon Valley company.
As a practitioner of the art of
management, I've tried instead to
lay out what I think constitutes a
good, solid management approach.
From my experience at Intel, this
consists of energetic and committed
people sitting down together,


looking at problems, and figuring
out ways to solve them. So myjob in
the book is to provide you with
basic ideas, clear principles, and
specific techniques you can use in
your own managerial
circumstances.


I am especially eager to reach the
middle manager, the usually
forgotten man or woman of any
organization. The first-line
supervisor on the shop floor and
the chief executive officer of a
company are both well appreciated.
You'll find many courses designed
to teach the former the
fundamentals of his work, while


practically all of our leading
business schools are set up to turn
out the latter. But between the two
is a large group of people, the
middle managers, who supervise
the shop-floor fore

INTRODUCTION


man, or who work as engineers,
accountants, and sales
representatives. Middle managers
are the muscle and bone of every
sizable organization, but they are
largely ignored despite their
immense importance to our society
and economy.


Middle managers are not confined
to big corporations. In fact, they can
be found in almost any business
operation. If you run a small tax
department at a law firm, you are a
middle manager. The same is true if
you are a school principal, an owner
of a distributorship, or a small-town
insurance agent. When people from
each of these enterprises read the
manuscript, their reactions
confirmed what I suspected: the
broad applicability of the
managerial ideas that were
developed at Intel as it grew from a
very small to a very large
organization.


Another group should be included
among middle managers—people
who may not supervise anyone
directly but who even without strict
organizational authority affect and
influence the work of others. These
know-how managers are sources of
knowledge, skills, and
understanding to people around
them in an organization. They are
specialists and experts of some sort
who act like consultants to other
members of the organization.
Teachers, market researchers,
computer mavens, and traffic
engineers shape the work of others
through their know-how just as


much as or more than the
traditional manager using
supervisory authority. Thus a knowhow manager can be legitimately
called a middle manager. In fact,
the more our world becomes
information- and service-oriented,
the more importance know-how
managers will acquire as members
of middle management. In short,
know-how managers should read

on.


At various times you will take
exception to what you read. "This
may be fine at Intel," you will say,
"but it


would never fly at PDQj where I
work. Nothing does until the Old
Man himself decrees it. Short of a
palace revolution, I can't use
anything you recommend." Let me
assure you that you will be able to
use most of what I say. As a middle
manager, of any sort, you are in
effect a chief executive of an
organization yourself Don't wait for
the principles and the practices you
find appealing or valid to be
imposed from the top. As a micro
CEO, you can improve your own
and your group's performance and
productivity, whether or not the
rest of the company follows suit.


The book contains three basic ideas.
The first is an output-oriented
approach to management. That is to
say, we apply some of the principles
and the discipline of the most
output-oriented of endeavors—
manufacturing — to other forms of
business enterprise, including most
emphatically the work of managers.
Consider Intel, which is a true
manufacturing and production
company, making highly complex
silicon chips as well as
computerlike products built from
them. Our company now has about
20,000 employees. Of these, 8,000
actually work to make the products.


Another 3,000 help them, as they
supervise the personnel, maintain
the machines, engineer, and
improve the manufacturing process.
Another 5,000 work in
administration, where they
schedule pro-auction, keep
personnel records, send bills to our
customers, and pay our suppliers.
Finally, some 4,000 design new
products, take them to the
marketplace, sell them, and service
them after the sale.


As we founded, organized, and
managed Intel, we found that all
our employees "produce" in some
sense —some make chips, others


prepare bills, while still others
create software designs or
advertising copy. We also found
that when we approached any work
done at Intel with this basic
understanding in mind, the
principles and discipline of
production gave us a systematic
way of


XU INTRODUCTION


managing it, much as the language
and concepts of finance created a
common approach to evaluating
and managing investments of any

sort.


2 The second idea is that the work
of a business, of a government
bureaucracy, of most forms of
human activity, is something
pursued not by individuals but by
teams. This idea is summed up in
what I regard as the


^ single most important sentence of
this book: The output of a manager
is the output of the organizational
units under his supervision or
influence. The question then
becomes what can managers do to
increase the output of their teams.
Put another way, what specifically
should they be doing during the day
when a virtually limitless number


of possible tasks calls for their
attention? To give you a way to
answer the question, I introduce
the concept oimanagerial leverage,
which measures the impact of what
managers do to increase the output
of their teams. High managerial
productivity, I argue, depends
largely on choosing to perform
tasks that possess high leverage.


- — A team will perform well only if
peak performance is elicited from
the individuals in it. This is the

third idea of the book. Can business

use whatever it is that motivates an
athlete to put out his "personal
best" consistently? I think business


can, which is why I examine the
sports analogy and the role of
something called task-relevant
feedback to get and to sustain a
high level of performance from the
members of a business team.


I am an engineer by training and a
manager of a high-technology
company by profession. As a
manager, I am also a member of
that group>—many millions strong
just in the United States—which
holds the key to increased
productivity: more and better goods
and services to meet people's needs.
I am an optimist and believe our
potential to increase our wealth has


hardly been tapped! I also strongly
believe that applying the methods
of production,


exercising managerial leverage, and
eliciting an athlete's desire for peak
performance can help nearly
everyone— lawyers, teachers,
engineers, supervisors, even book
editors; in short, middle managers
of all kinds—to work more
productively.


So, let us begin by taking a field trip
to a factory . . .


Part One


THE


BREAKFAST


FACTORY


1


The Basics of Production:
Delivering a Breakfast


(or a College Graduate,


or a Compiler, or a Convicted
Criminal...)


The Three-Minute Egg


To understand the principles of


production, imagine that you're a
waiter, which I was while I went to
college, and that your task is to
serve a breakfast consisting of a
three-minute soft-boiled egg,
buttered toast, and coffee. Your job
is to prepare and deliver the three
items simultaneously, each of them
fresh and hot.


The task here encompasses the
basic requirements of production.
These are to build and deliver
products in response to the
demands of the customer at a
scheduled delivery time, at an
acceptable quality level, and at the
lowest possible cost. Production's


charter cannot be to deliver

whatever the customer wants
whenever he wants it, for this
would require an infinite
production capacity or the
equivalent—very large, ready-todeliver inventories. In our example,
the customer may want to have a
perfect three-minute egg with hot
buttered toast and steaming coffee
waiting for him the moment he sits
down. To fulfill such an
expectation, you would either have
to have your kitchen idle and poised
to serve the customer whenever he
drops in, or have a ready-to-con

HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


sume inventory of perfectly boiled
eggs, hot buttered toast, and coffee.
Neither is practical.


Instead, a manufacturer should
accept the responsibility of
delivering a product at the time
committed to —in this case, by
implication, about five to ten
minutes after the customer arrives

at our breakfast establishment. And

we must make our breakfast at a

cost that enables us to sell it at a
competitive price and still make an
acceptable profit. How are we going
to do this in the most intelligent
way? We start by looking at our
production flow.


The first thing we must do is to pin
down the step in the flow that will
determine the overall shape of our
operation, which we'll call the
limiting step. The issue here is
simple: which of the breakfast
components takes the longest to
prepare? Because the coffee is
already steaming in the kitchen and
the toast takes only about a minute,
the answer is obviously the egg, so
we should plan the entire job
around the time needed to boil it.
Not only does that component take
the longest to prepare, the egg is
also for most customers the most
important feature of the breakfast.


What must happen is illustrated
opposite. To work back from the
time of delivery, you'll need to
calculate the time required to
prepare the three components to
ensure that they are all ready
simultaneously. First you must
allow time to assemble the items on
a tray. Next you must get the toast
from the toaster and the coffee
from the pot, as well as the egg out
of the boiling water. Adding the
required time to do this to the time
needed to get and cook the egg
defines the length of the entire
process—called, in production
jargon, the total throughput time.


Now you come to the toast. Using
the egg time as your base, you must
allow yourself time to get and toast
the slices of bread. Finally, using
the toast time as your base, you can
determine when you need to pour
the coffee. The

key idea is that we construct our
production flow by starting with the
longest (or most difficult, or most
sensitive, or most expensive) step
and work our way back. Notice
when each of the three steps began
and ended. We planned our flow
around the most critical step—the
time required to boil the egg—and
we staggered each of the other steps
according to individual throughput
times; again in production jargon,
we offset them from each other.


The idea of a limiting step has very
broad applicability. Take, for
example, the need to recruit college
graduates to work for Intel. Certain


of our managers visit the colleges,
interview some of the seniors, and
invite the more promising
candidates to visit the company. We
bear the expense of the candidates'
trip, which can be considerable.
During the trip, the students are
closely interviewed by other
managers and technical people.
After due consideration,
employment is offered to some of
the students whose skills and
capabilities match our needs


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


best, and those who accept the
offers eventually come to work for


the company.


To apply the basic principle of
production, you need to build the
sequence here around its most
expensive feature, which is the
students' trip to the plant, thanks to
the cost of travel and the time that
Intel managers spend with the
candidates. To minimize the use of
this step per final college hire, we
obviously have to increase the ratio
of accepted offers to applicants
invited to visit the plant, which we
do by using phone interviews to
screen people before issuing
invitations. The technique saves
money, substantially increases the


ratio of offers extended per plant
visit, and reduces the need to use
the expensive limiting step per hire.


The principle of time offsets is also
present here. Working back from
the time the students will graduate,
the recruiter staggers the various
steps involved to allow time for
everything—on-campus interviews,
phone screening, plant visits—to
take place at the appropriate times
during the months preceding
graduation.


Production Operations


Other production principles


underlie the preparation of our
breakfast. In the making of it, we
find present the three fundamental
types of production operations:
process manufacturing, an activity
that physically or chemically
changes material just as boiling
changes an egg; assembly, in which
components are put together to
constitute a new entity just as the
egg' the toast, and the coffee
together make a breakfast; and test,
which subjects the components or
the total to an examination of its
characteristics. There are, for
example, visual tests made at points
in the breakfast production Dro

cess: you can see that the coffee is
steaming and that the toast is
brown. Process, assembly, and test
operations can be readily


The Basics of Production j


applied to other very different kinds
of productive work. Take, for
instance, the task of training a sales
force to sell a new product. The
three types of production
operations can be easily identified.
The conversion of large amounts of
raw data about the product into
meaningful selling strategies
comprehensible to the sales
personnel is a process step, which


transforms data into strategies. The
combination of the various sales
strategies into a coherent program
can be compared to an assembly
step. Here the appropriate productselling strategies and pertinent
market data (such as competitive
pricing and availability) are made to
flow into one presentation, along
with such things as brochures,
handouts, and flip charts. The test
operation comes in the form of a
"dry run" presentation with a
selected group of field sales
personnel and field sales
management. If the dry run fails
the test, the material must be


"reworked" (another wellestablished manufacturing concept)
to meet the concerns and objections
of the test audience.


The development of a "compiler," a
major piece of computer software,
also demonstrates process,
assembly, and test. A computer
understands and uses human
instruction only if it receives such
instruction in its own language. A
compiler is an interpreter, enabling
the computer to translate into its
language material written in terms
and phrases resembling English.
With a compiler, a programmer can
think more or less like a human


being rather than having to adapt
himself to the way the computer
processes information. The task of
getting a machine to interpret and
translate in this fashion is
obviously formidable; thus the
development of a compiler takes
strenuous effort on the part of
skilled and gifted software
engineers. The effort, however, is
justified by the simplification it
brings to computer use.


In any case, the development of the
individual pieces out of which a
compiler is built represents a series
of processing steps. Actual working
pieces of software are


generated out of specifications and
basic design know-how. Each piece
then undergoes an individual
operation called a "unit test." When
one fails, the defective portion of
the software is returned to the
process phase for "rework." After all
the pieces pass their respective unit
tests, they are assembled to form
the compiler. Then, of course, a
"system test" is performed on the
complete product before it is
shipped to the customer. Time
offsets are used extensively in the
task. Because throughput times for
the various engineering steps are
well established, the timing of the


releases of various bodies of
software from one stage to another
can all be calculated and staged in
advance.


Breakfast preparation, college
recruiting, sales training, and
compiler design are very much
unlike one another, but all of them
possess a basically similar flow of
activity to produce a specific output.


A Few Complications


Real life, as you know, is full of
thickets and underbrush. In a
schematic flow chart, our breakfast
operation assumed infinite capacity,


meaning that nobody had to wait
for an available toaster or for a pot
to boil an egg in. But no such ideal
world exists. What would happen if
you had to stand in a line of waiters,
waiting for your turn to use the
toaster? If you didn't adjust your
production flow to account for the
queue, your three-minute egg could
easily become a six-minute egg. So
limited toaster capacity means you
have to redo your flow around the
new limiting step. The egg still
determines the overall quality of
the breakfast, but your time offsets
must be altered. How would our
model reflect the change in


manufacturing flow? Working back
from the time of breakfast delivery,
let's see how the production is
affected, as illustrated opposite. The
egg cycle remains the same, as does
the one for coffee. But limited
toaster capacity makes for


The Basics of Production g


quite a difference. Now you must
account for the delivery time of the
toast and the wait for a free toaster.
This means the whole production
process has to be conceived
differently. Toaster capacity has
become the limiting step, and what
you do has to be reworked around


it.

With limited toaster capacity,
making the toast becomes the
limiting step.


Now let's complicate things a little
further. What happens if you are
stuck in line waiting for a toaster
when it's time to start boiling your
egg? Your conflict is seemingly
irreconcilable, but it really isn't. If


you were managing the restaurant,
you could turn your personnel into
specialists by hiring one egg-cooker,
one toast=maker, one coffeepourer, and one person to supervise
the operation. But that, of course,
creates an immense amount of
overhead, probably making it too
expensive to consider.


If you were a waiter, you could ask
the waiter in line next to you to
help out—to put your toast in while
you ran off to start your egg. But
when you have to depend on
someone else, the results are likely
to be less predicta

lO HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


ble. As the manager, you could add
another toaster, but this becomes
an expensive addition of capital
equipment You could run the
toaster continuously and build up
an inventory of hot toast, throwing
away what you can't use but always
having immediate access to
product. That means waste, which
can also become too expensive for
the operation. But at least you know
that alternatives do exist:
equipment capacity, manpower, and
inventory can be traded* off against
each other and then balanced
against delivery time.


Because each alternative costs
money, your task is to find the most
cost-effective way to deploy your
resources— the key to optimizing
all types of productive work. Bear in
mind that in this and in other such
situations there is a right answer,
the one that can give you the best
delivery time and product quality at
the lowest possible cost. To find
that right answer, you must develop
a clear understanding of the tradeoffs between the various factors—
manpower, capacity, and inventory
—and you must reduce the
understanding to a quantifiable set
of relationships. You probably won't


use a stopwatch to conduct a timeand-motion study of the person
behind a toaster; nor will you
calculate the precise trade-off
between the cost of toast inventory
and the added toaster capacity in
mathematical terms. What is
important is the thinking you force
yourself to go through to
understand the relationship
between the various aspects of your
production process.


Let's take our manufacturing
example a step further and turn our
business into a high-volume
breakfast factory operation. First,
you buy a continuous egg-boiler


that will produce a constant supply
of perfectly boiled three-minute
eggs. It will look something like
what's drawn in the figure opposite.
Note that our business now
assumes a high and predictable
demand for three-minute eggs; it
cannot now readily provide a fourminute egg, because automated
equipment is not very flexible.
Second, you


match the output of the continuous
egg-boiler with the output of a
continuous toaster, as specialized
personnel load each piece of
equipment and deliver the product.
We have now turned things into a


continuous operation at the
expense of flexibility, and we can no
longer prepare each customer's
order exactly when and how he
requests it. So our customers have
to adjust their expectations if they
want to enjoy the benefits of our
new mode: lower cost and more
predictable product quality.


vO,—^^rv


1


The continuous egg-boiler: a
constant supply of three-minute

eggs.


But continuous operation does not
automatically mean lower cost and
better quality. What would happen
if the water temperature in the
continuous egg-boiler quietly went
out of specification? The entire
work-in-process—all the eggs in the
boiler—and the output of the
machine from the time the
temperature climbed or dropped to
the time the malfunction was

discovered becomes unusable. All


the toast is also wasted because you
don't have any eggs to serve with it.
How do you minimize the risk of a
breakdown of this sort? Performing
afunctional test is one way. From
time to time you open an egg as it
comes out of the machine and
check its quality. But you will have
to throw away the egg tested. A
second way involves in-process
inspection, which can take many
forms. You could, for example,
simply insert a thermometer into
the water so that the temperature


could be easily and frequently
checked. To avoid having to pay
someone to read the thermometer,


you could connect an electronic
gadget to it that would set off bells
anytime the temperature varied by
a degree or two. The point is that
whenever possible, you should
choose in-process tests over those
that destroy product.


What else could go wrong with our
continuous egg-machine? The eggs
going into it could be cracked or
rotten, or they could be over- or
undersized, which would affect how
fast they cook. To avoid such
problems, you will want to look at
the eggs at the time of receipt,
something called incoming or
receiving inspection. If the eggs are


unacceptable in some way, you are
going to have to send them back,
leaving you with none. Now you
have to shut down. To avoid that,
you need a raw material inventory.
But how large should it be? The
principle to be applied here is that
you should have enough to cover
your consumption rate for the
length of time it takes to replace
your raw material. That means if
your egg man comes by and delivers
once a day, you want to keep a day's
worth of inventory on hand to
protect yourself. But remember,
inventory costs money, so you have
to weigh the advantage of carrying a


day's supply against the cost of
carrying it. Besides the cost of the
raw material and the cost of money,
you should also try to gauge the
opportunity at risk: what would it
cost if you had to shut your egg
machine down for a day? How
many customers would you lose?
How much would it cost to lure
them back? Such questions define
the opportunity at risk.


Adding Value


All production flows have a basic
characteristic: the material becomes
more valuable as it moves through
the process. A boiled egg is more


valuable than a raw one, a fully
assembled breakfast is more
valuable than its constituent parts,
and finally, the breakfast placed in
front of


the customer is more valuable still.
The last carries the perceived value
the customer associates with the

establishment when he drives into
the parking lot after seeing the sign
"Andy's Better Breakfasts."
Similarly, a finished compiler is
more valuable than the constituent
parts of semantic analysis, code
generation, and run time, and a
college graduate to whom we are
ready to extend an employment


offer is more valuable to us than
the college student we meet on
campus for the first time.


A common rule we should always
try to heed is to detect and fix any
problem in a production process at
the lowest-value stage possible.
Thus, we should find and reject the
rotten egg as it's being delivered
from our supplier rather than
permitting the customer to find it.
Likewise, if we can decide that we
don't want a college candidate at the
time of the campus interview rather
than during the course of a plant
visit, we save the cost of the trip
and the time of both the candidate


and the interviewers. And we
should also try to find any
performance problem at the time of
the unit test of the pieces that make
up a compiler rather than in the
course of the test of the final
product itself.


Finally, at the risk of being
considered hard-hearted, let's
examine the criminal justice system
as if it were a production process
aimed at finding criminals and
putting them into jail. The
production begins when a crime is
reported to the police and the police
respond. In many instances, after
some questions are asked, no


further action can be taken. For
those crimes which the police can
pursue, the second step is more
investigation. But the case often
ends here for lack of evidence,
complaints being dropped, and so
on. If things move to the next stage,
a suspect is arrested, and the police
try to find witnesses and build a
case, hoping to get an indictment.
Once again, an indictment is often
not returned because of insufficient
evidence. For the cases that actually
do go


'4 HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


found not guilty; sometimes the


case is dismissed. But when a
conviction is secured, the process
moves to the sentencing and
appeals round. At times a person
found guilty of a crime will be given
a suspended'sentence and
probation, and at others the
conviction will be overturned on
appeal. For the small fraction that
remains, the final stage is jail.


If we make some reasoned
assumptions about the percentages
that move forward at each stage and
the costs associated with each, we
arrive at some striking conclusions.
If we compile the cost of the effort
that goes into securing a conviction


and assign it only to those criminals
who actually end up in jail, we find
that the cost of a single conviction
works out to be well over a million
dollars—an absolutely staggering
sum. The number is so high, of
course, because only a very small
percentage of the flow of accused
persons makes it all the way
through the process. Everyone
knows that prisons are
overcrowded, and that many
criminals end ud serving shorter jail
terms or no jail terms at all because
cells are in such short supply. So a
terribly expensive trade-off results,
violating the most important


production principles. The limiting
step here should clearly be
obtaining a conviction. The
construction cost of a jail cell even
today is only some $80,000. This,
plus the $10-20,000 it costs to keep
a person in jail for a year, is a small
amount compared to the million
dollars required to secure a
conviction. Not to jail a criminal in
whom society has invested over a
million dollars for iacK ot an
$80,000 jail cell clearly misuses
society's total investment in the
criminal justice system. And this
happens oecause we permit the
wrong step (the availability ot jail


cells) to limit the overall process.

Managing the Breakfast Factory




Indicators as a Key Tool


A hungry public has loved the
breakfast you've been serving, and
thanks to the help of your many
customers and a friendly banker,
you've created a breakfast factory,
which among other things uses
specialized production lines for
toast, coffee, and eggs. As manager


of the fac |


tory, you have a substantial staff
and a lot of automated 1


equipment. But to run your
operation well, you will need a set
of good indicators, or
measurements* Your output, of
course, is no longer the breakfasts
you deliver personally but rather all
the breakfasts your factory delivers,
profits generated, and the
satisfaction of your customers. Just
to get a fix on your output, you need
a number of indicators; to get
efficiency and high output, you
need even more of them. The


number of possible indicators you
can choose is virtually limitless, but
for any set of them to be useful, you
have to focus each indicator on a
specific operational goal.


Let's say that as manager of the
breakfast factory, you will work
with five indicators to meet your
production goals on a daily basis.
Which five would they be? Put
another way, which five pieces of
information would you

waut tu look at each day,
immediately upon arriving at your


office?
