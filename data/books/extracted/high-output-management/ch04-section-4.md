Another example of leverage that
depends on timely action is what
you do when you learn that a valued
subordinate has decided to quit. In
such a case, you must direct
yourself to the situation
immediately if you want to change


the person's mind. If you put it off,
all your chances are lost. Thus to
maximize the leverage of his
activities, a manager must keep
timeliness, which is often critical,
firmly in mind.


Leverage can also be negative. Some
managerial activities can reduce the
output of an organization. I mean
something very simple. Suppose I
am a key participant at a meeting
and I arrive unprepared. Not only
do I waste the time of the people
attending the meeting because of


my lack of preparation—a direct
cost of my carelessness —but I


deprive the other participants of the
opportunity to use that time to do
something else.


Each time a manager imparts his
knowledge, skills, or values to a
group, his leverage is high, as
members of the group will carry
what they learn to many others. But
again, leverage can be positive or
negative. An example of leverage
that I hope is high and positive is
my talk in the orientation course.
During the two hours I have, I try to
impart a great deal of information
about Intel—its history, its
objectives, its values, its style—to a
group of two hundred new


employees. Besides what I say
specifically, my approach toward
answering questions and my
conduct in general communicate
our way of doing things to these
employees when they are most
impressionable.


Here is another example of this
kind of leverage. To train a group of
salesmen, Barbara, an Intel
marketing engineer, sets out to
teach them what the organization's
products are. If she does her job
well, the salespeople will be better
equipped to sell the line. If she does
it poorly, great and obvious damage
is done.


A final, less formal, example here:
Cindy, as you recall, is a member of
a technical coordinating body in
which she tries to disseminate her
understanding of a specific
technology to all of the company's
manufacturing groups. In effect,
she uses the coordinating body as
an informal training vehicle to
effect high leverage on her
counterparts in neighboring Intel
organizations.


A manager can also exert high
leverage by engaging in an activity
that takes him only a short time,
but that affects another person's
performance over a long time. A


performance review represents a
good example of this. With the few
hours' work that a manager spends
preparing and delivering the review,
he can affect the work of its
recipient enormously. Here too a
manager can exert either positive or
negative leverage. A subordinate
can be motivated and even
redirected in his efforts, or the


Managerial Leverage ay


review can discourage and
demoralize him for who knows how
long.


Another seemingly trivial piece of


work—creating a tickler file—can
improve daily work significantly for
a long time. Setting up the simple
mechanical aid is a one-time
activity, yet it is likely to improve
the productivity of the manager
who uses it indefinitely. Thus the
leverage here is very, very high.


Examples of high negative leverage
abound. After going through the
annual planning process, an Intel
manager saw that, in spite of
successful cost reduction ettorts in
the prior year, his division was still
not going to make any money in the
coming year. The manager became
depressed. Though he didn't realize


it, he "almost immediately began to
affect people around him and soon
depression spread throughout his
organization. He snapped out of it
only when someone on his staff
finally told him what he was doing
to the people under him. Another
example is waffling, when a
manager puts off a decision that
will affect the work of other people.
In effect, the lack of a decision is
the same as a negative decision; no
green light is a red light, and work
can stop for a whole organization.


Both the depressed and the waffling
manager can have virtually
unlimited negative leverage. If


people are badly affected by a poor
sales training effort, the situation
can be handled by retraining the
group. But the negative leverage
produced by depression and
waffling is very hard to counter
because their impact on an
organization is both so pervasive
and so elusive.


Managerial meddling is also an
example of negative leverage. This
occurs when a supervisor uses his
superior knowledge and experience
of a subordinate's responsibilities to
assume command of a situation
rather than letting the subordinate
work things through himself. For


example, if a senior manager sees
an indicator showing an
undesirable trend and dictates to
the person


responsible a detailed set of actions
to be taken, that is managerial
meddling. In general, meddling
stems from a supervisor exploiting
too much superior work knowledge
(real or imagined). The negative
leverage produced comes from the
fact that after being exposed to
many such instances, the
subordinate will begin to take a
much more restricted view of what
is expected of him, showing less
initiative in solving his own


problems and referring them
instead to his supervisor. Because
the output of the organization will
consequently be reduced in the long
run, meddling is clearly an activity
having negative managerial
leverage.


The third kind of managerial
activity with high leverage is
exercised by a person with unique
skills and knowledge. One such
person is an Intel marketing
engineer responsible for setting
prices for the productline-Hundreds of salespeople in the field can
be negatively affected if prices are
set too high: no matter how hard


they may try, they won't be able to
get any business. Of course, if the
prices were set too low, we would
be giving money away.


Take another example. An Intel
development engineer who has
uniquely detailed knowledge of a
particular manufacturing process
effectively controls how it is used.
Since the process will eventually
provide the foundation for the work
of many product designers all over
the company, the leverage the
development engineer exerts is
enormous. The same is true for a
geologist in an oil company or an
actuary in an insurance firm. All are


specialists whose work is important
for the work of their organization at
large. The person who comprehends
the critical facts or has the critical
insights—the "knowledge specialist"
or the "know-how manager"—has
tremendous authority and influence
on the work of others, and therefore
very high leverage.


The art of management lies in the
capacity to select from the many
activities of seemingly comparable
signifi

cance the one or two or three that
provide leverage well beyond the
others and concentrate on them.


For me, paying close attention to
customer complaints constitutes a
high-leverage activity. Aside from
making a customer happy, the
pursuit tends to produce important
insights into the workings of my
own operation. Such complaints
may be numerous, and though all of
them need to be followed up by
someone, they don't all require or
wouldn't all benefit from my
personal attention. Which one out
of ten or twenty complaints to dig
into, analyze, and follow up is
where art comes into the work of a
manager. The basis of that art is an
intuition that behind this complaint


and not the other lurk many deeper
problems.


DELEGATION AS LEVERAGE


Because managerial time has a
hierarchy of values, delegation is an
essential aspect of management.
The "delegator" and "delegatee"
must share a common information

base and a common set of
operational ideas or notions on how
to go about solving problems, a
requirement that is frequendy not
met. Unless both parties share the
relevant common base, the
delegatee can become an effective
proxy only with specific


instructions. As in meddling, where
specific activities are prescribed in
detail, this produces low managerial
leverage.


Picture this. I am your supervisor,
and I walk over to you with pencil
in hand and tell you to take it. You
reach for the pencil, but I won't let
go. So I say, "What is wrong with
you? Why can't I delegate the pencil
to you?" We all have some things
that we don't really want to delegate
simply because we like doing them
and would rather not let go. For
your managerial effectiveness, this
is not too bad so long as it is based
on a conscious decision that you


will hold on to certain tasks that
you enjoy performing, even though
you could, if


you chose, delegate them. But be
sure to know exactly what you're
doing, and avoid the charade of
insincere delegation, which can
produce immense negative
managerial leverage.


^ Given a choice, should you
delegate activities that are familiar
to you or those that aren't? Before
answering, consider the following
principle: delegation without
follow-through is abdication. You
can never wash your hands of a


task. Even after you delegate it, you
are still responsible for its
accomplishment, and monitoring
the delegated task is the only
practical way for you to ensure a
result. Monitoring is not meddling,
but means checking to make sure
an activity is proceeding in line with
expectations. Because it is easier to
monitor something with which you
are familiar, if you have a choice
you should delegate those activities
you know best. But recall the pencil
experiment and understand before
the fact that this will very likely go
against your emotional grain.


Please turn back to the table of my


day's activities on pages 43-47.
During the executive staff meeting
we heard two follow-up
presentations, one on the status of
an extremely important marketing
program and the other on the
progress of a program aimed at
reducing manufacturing throughput
times. Both reviews are examples of
monitoring. Earlier, we had
assigned each to a middle manager
and made sure these managers and
the senior staff agreed about what
the programs were to be. The
middle managers then went about
itheir business expecting to report
back to the executive staff, the body


that delegated the programs to
them.


Monitoring the results of delegation
resembles the monitoring used in
quality assurance. We should apply
quality assurance principles and
monitor at the lowest-added-value
stage of the process. For example,
review rough drafts of reports that
you have delegated; don't wait until
your subordinates have spent time
polishing


them into final form before you
find out that you have a basic
problem with the contents. A
second principle applies to the


frequency with which you check
your subordinates' work. A variable
approach should be employed,
using different sampling schemes
with various subordinates; you
should increase or decrease your
frequency depending on whether
your subordinate is performing a
newly delegated task or one that he
has experience handling. How often
you monitor should not be based on
what you believe your subordinate
can do in general, but on his
experience with a specific task and
his prior performance with it—his
task-relevant maturity, something
111 talk about in detail later. As the


subordinate's work improves over
time, you should respond with a
corresponding reduction in the
intensity of the monitoring.


To use quality assurance principles
effectively, the manager should
only go into details randomly, just
enough to try to ensure that the
subordinate is moving ahead
satisfactorily. To check into all the
details of a delegated task would be
like quality assurance testing ioo
percent of what manufacturing
turned out.


Making certain types of decisions is
something managers frequently


delegate to subordinates. How is
this best done? By monitoring their
decision-making process. How do
you do that? Let's examine what
Intel goes through to approve a
capital equipment purchase. We ask
a subordinate to think through the
entire matter carefully before
presenting a request for approval
And to monitor how good his
thinking is, we ask him quite
specific questions about his request
during a review meeting. If he
answers them convincingly, we'll
approve what he wants. This
technique allows us to find out how
good the thinking is without having


to go through it ourselves.


Increasing Managerial Activity
Rate: Speeding Up the Line


Of course, the most obvious way to
increase managerial output is to
increase the rate, or speed, of
performing work. The relationship
here is:


Managerial Output _ Activity
Performed


Time ' - L X Trn^ "


where L is the leverage of the
activity.


The most common approach to
increasing a manager's productivity
—his output over time—has been
time-management techniques,
which try to reduce the
denominator on both sides of this
equation. Any number of
consultants will tell a manager that
the way to higher productivity is to
handle a piece of paper only once,
to hold only stand-up meetings
(which will presumably be short),
and to turn his desk so that he
presents his back to the door.


These time-management
suggestions can be improved upon,
I think, by applying our production


principles. Hrst, we must identify
our limiting step: what is the ^'egg"
in our work? In a manager's life
some things really «ave to happen
on a schedule that is absolute. For
m<> an example is the class I
teach. I know when it is going to
meet, and I know I must prepare for
it. There is no


give m the time here, because over
two hundred students will be
expecting me. Accordingly, I have to
create onsets and schedule my
other work around this limiting
step. In short, if we determine what
is immovable and manipulate the
more yielding activities around it,


we can wont more etticiently.


A second production principle we
can apply to managerial work is
batching similar tasks. Anv
manufacturing operation requires a
certain amount of set-up time So
for managerial work to proceed
efficiently, we suouiu use the same
set-up effort to apply across a group


of similar activities. Think about
our continuous egg-boiler, which
was installed to produce finequality, identical, three-minute
eggs. Should we now decide to serve
our customers four-minute eggs, we
would have to slow down the


conveyor belt moving them through
the hot water. The adjustment takes
time: not only do we adjust nuts
and bolts on the machine, we also
have to inspect the quality of the
four-minute eggs by sampling a few
of them.


Set-up time has many parallels in
managerial work. For example, once
we have prepared a set of
illustrations for a training class, we
will obviously increase our
productivity if we can use the same
set over and over again with other
classes or groups. Similarly, if a
manager has a number of reports to
read or a number of performance


reviews to approve, he should set
aside a block of time and do a batch
of them together, one after the
other, to maximize the use of the
mental set-up time needed for the
task.


What makes running a factory
different from running a job shop?
The latter is prepared to service any
customer who drops in; the owner
handles the job required and moves
on to the next one. A factory, on the
other hand, is usually run by
forecast and not by individual order.
From my experience a large portion
of managerial work can be
forecasted. Accordingly, forecasting


those things you can and setting
yourself up to do them is only
common sense and an important
way to minimize the feeling and the
reality of fragmentation
experienced in managerial work.
Forecasting and planning your time
around key events are literally like
running an efficient factory.


What is the medium of a manager's
forecast? It is something very
simple: his calendar. Most people
use their calendars as a repository
of "orders" that come in. Someone
throws an order to a manager for
his time, and it automatically shows
up on his calendar* This is mind

less passivity. To gain better control
of his time, the manager should use
his calendar as a "production" planuing tooi, taking a firm initiative to
schedule work that isnot time
critical between those
"limitingsteps" in the

be applied here.


because manufacturing people trust

alfWay through and back up behind
a bottleneck. Instead, factory
managers *ay no at tne outset and
keep the start level from
overloading the system. Other kinds
of managers find uns nara to apply
because their indicators of'capacity
are not as well established or not as
believable. How much time do you
need to read your mail, to write
your reports, to meet with a
colleague? You mav not know
precisely but you surely have a feel
for the time required. And you
should exploit that sense to


schedule your work.


To use your calendar as a
production-planning tool, you must
accept responsibility for two things:


i. You should move toward the
active use of your calendar, taking
the initiative to fill the holes

between the time-critical events
with non-time-critical tnough
necessary activities.


2. You should say "no" at the outset
to work bevond your capacity to
handle.

what amounts to


no. Remember too that your time is
your one finite


resource, and when you say "yes" to
one thing you are inevitably saying
"no" to another.


The next production principle you
can apply is to allow slack —a bit of
looseness in your scheduling.
Highway planners, for example,
know that a freeway can handle an
optimum number of vehicles*
Having fewer cars means that the
road is not being used at capacity.
But at that optimum point, if just a
few more cars are allowed to enter
the traffic flow, everything comes to
a crunching halt. With the new
metering devices that control access
during the rush hour, planners can


get a fix on the right number. The
same thing can be done for
managerial work. There is an
optimum degree of loading, with
enough slack built in so that one
unanticipated phone call will not
ruin your schedule for the rest of
the day. You need some slack.


Another production principle is very
nearly the opposite. A manager
should carry a raw material
inventory in terms of projects. This
is not to be confused with his workin-process inventory, because that,
like eggs in a continuous boiler,
tends to spoil or become obsolete
over time. Instead this inventory


should consist of things you need to
do but don't need to finish right
away— discretionary projects, the
kind the manager can work on to
increase his group's productivity
over the long term. Without such
an inventory of projects, a manager
will most probably use his free time
meddling in his subordinates 5
work.


A final principle. Most production
practices follow well-established
procedures and, rather than
reinventing the wheel repeatedly,
use a specific method that has been
shown to work before. But
managers tend to be inconsistent


and bring a welter of approaches to
the same task. We should work to
change that. As we become more
consistent, we should also
remember that the value of an
administrative procedure is
contained not in formal


d6 high output management


statementsbut in the real thinking
that led to its establishment. 1 his
means that even as we try to
standardize what we do, we should
continue to think critically about
wnat we do and the approaches we

use.


Built-in Leverage: How Many
Subordinates Should You Have . . .


An important component of
managerial leverage is the number
of subordinates a manager has. If
he does not have enough, his
leverage is obviously reduced. If he
has too many, he gets bogged down
—with the same result. As a rule of
thumb, a manager whose work is
largely supervisory should have six
to eight subordinates; three or four
are too few and ten are too many.
This range comes from a guideline
that a manager should allocate
auout a half day per week to each of
his subordinates. {1 wo days a week


per subordinate would probably
lead to meddling; an hour a week
does not provide enoueh
opportunity for monitoring.)


The six to eight rule is right for the
classically hierarchical manager
whose primary work is the
supervision of others. What about a
know-how manager, the middle
manager who mainly supplies
expertise and informations liven it
he works without a single
subordinate, servicing a number of
varied "customers" as an internal

consultant can in itself be a fulltime job. In fact, anyone who
spends about a half day per week as


a member of a planning, advisory,
or coordinating group has the
equivalent 01 a subordinate. So as a
rule of thumb, if a manager is both
a hierarchical supervisor and a
supplier of know-how, he should try
to have a total of six to e,Vht
subordinates or their equivalent.


Sometimes a businesses organized
in a way that makes u.e lueai tanout of six to eight subordinates hard
to reach. A manufacturing plant, for
example, may have an engineering
section and a production section, in
which

case the plant manager would only
have two people reporting directly
to him. The manager might then
choose to "acf ? as one of the two
subordinates, choosing to be his
own engineering manager, for
instance. If he does that, the
manufacturing manager will still
report to him, and he will have
added the people who would
ordinarily report to the head of
engineering. So the plant manager
will actually have six direct reports:
five engineers and the
manufacturing manager. The
arrangement, shown below, does


not have the engineers appearing to
be at the same organizational level
as the manufacturing manager —
something he would surely take
exception to.

This arrangement will avoid forcing
the plant manager either into onthe-job retirement or into
meddling.


Interruptions — The Plague of


Managerial V/ork


The next important production
concept we can apply to managerial
work is to strive toward regularity.
We could obviously run our
breakfast factory more efficiently if
customers arrived in a steady and
predictable stream


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


ramer man dropping in by ones and
twos. Though we can t control our
customers' habits, we should trv to
smooth out our workload as much
as possible. As noted, we sxiomd try
to make our managerial work take


on the characteristics of a factory,
not a job shop. Accordingly, we
snouia do everything we can to
prevent little stops and starts m our
day as well as interruptions brought
on uy uig emergencies. Even
though some of the latter are
unavoidable, we should always be
looking for sources of moire highpriority trouble by cutting windows
into the black box of our
organization. Recognizing vou've eot a time bomb on your hands
means you can address a problem
when you want to, not after the
bomb has o™<* nfF But because
you must coordinate your work


with that £ otxxer managers, you
can only move toward regularity if
others do too. In other words, the
same blocks of time must oe used
for like activities. For example, at
Intel Monday mornings have been
set aside throughout the
corporation as the time when
planning groups~meet. So anybody
who belongs to one can count on
Monday for that purpose and be
free of scheduling conflicts.


About twenty middle managers at
Intel were once asked to be part of
an experiment. After pairing up,
they tried some role-playing in
which one manager was to define


the problem most limiting his
output and the vuicr was to oe a
consultant who would analyze the
problem and propose solutions.


The most common problem cited
was uncontrolled interruptions,
which m remarkably uniform
fashion affected uocn supervisory
and know-how managers. Everyone
felt that the interruptions got in the
way of his "own" work interruptions
had a common source, most
frequently' 1°2 Frcm sub ordinates
and from people outside the
managers immediate organization
but whose work the managers
influenced. For those in


manufacturing, the interruptions
most often came from production

opera

tors, and for marketing people,
from outside customers: in short,
from the consumers of the middle
managers' authority and
information.


The most frequently proposed
solutions were not very practical.
The idea mentioned most often was

to create blocks of time for
individual work by hiding
physically. But this is a less than
happy answer, because the
interrupters obviously have


legitimate problems, and if the
manager responded by hiding, these
would pile up. One "solution" was a
suggestion that customers not call
marketing managers at certain
hours. No good.


There are better ways. Let's apply a
production concept. Manufacturers
turn out standard products. By
analogy, if you can pin down what
kind of interruptions you're getting,
you can prepare standard responses
for those that pop up most often.
Customers don't come up with
totally new questions and problems
day in and day out, and because the
same ones tend to surface


repeatedly, a manager can reduce
time spent handling interruptions
using standard responses. Having
them available also means that a
manager can delegate much of the
job to less experienced personnel.


Also, if you use the production
principle of batching — that is,
handling a group of similar chores
at one time— many interruptions
that come from your subordinates
can be accumulated and handled
not randomly, but at staff and at
one-on-one meetings, the subject of
the next chapter. If such meetings
are held regularly, people can't
protest too much if they're asked to


batch questions and problems for
scheduled times, instead of
interrupting you whenever they

want.


The use of indicators, especially the
bank of indicators kept over time,
can also reduce the time a manager
spends dealing with interruptions.
How fast he can answer a question
depends on how fast he can put his
finger on the information he needs
for a response. By


maintaining an archive of
information, a manager oocsn-t
nave to do ad hoc research every
time the phone nngs. r


If the people who interrupt you
knew how much they were
uisturomg you, they would probably
police them-selves more closely and
cut down on the number of mues
tney teit they had to talk to you
right away. In any case, a manager
should try to force his frequent
interrupters to make an active
decision about whether an issue can
wait. So, instead of going into
hiding, a manager can hang a sign
on his door that says, "I am doing
inuivunai work. Pl ease don't
interrupt me unless it really cant
wait until 2:00." Then hold an open
office nour, and be completely


receptive to anybody who wants to
see you. The key is this: understand
that interrupters have legitimate
problems that need to be han--*u•
*oat s why they're bringing them to
you. But you can channel the time
needed to deal with them into orgaxnzeu, scneduled form by
providing an alternative to
mterruption-a scheduled meeting
or an office hour.


ine point is to impose a pattern on
the way a manager copes with
problems. To make something
recn.W Lt was once irregular is a
fundamental productionprind-t«e,
anu tuat s now you should try to


handle the interruptions that
plague you.


Meetings—


The Medium


of Managerial W>rk


Meetings have a bad name. One
school of management thought
considers them the curse of the
manager's existence. Someone who
did a study found that managers
spend up to 50 percent of their time
in meetings, and implied that this
was time wasted. Peter Drucker
once said that spending more than


25 percent of his time in meetings
is a sign of a manager's
malorganization, and William H.
Whyte, Jr., in his book The
Organization Man, described
meetings as C€ non-contributory
labor* that managers must endure.


But there is another way to regard
meetings. Earlier we said that a big
part of a middle manager's work is
to supply information and knowhow, and to impart a sense of the
preferred method of handling
things to the groups under his
control and influence. A manager
also makes and helps to make
decisions. Both kinds of basic


managerial tasks can only occur
during face-to-face encounters, and
therefore only during meetings.
Thus I will assert again that a
meeting is nothing less than the
medium through which managerial
work is performed. That means we
should not be fighting their very
existence, but rather using the time
spent in them as efficiently as
possible.


The two basic managerial roles
produce two basic kinds of
meetings. In the first kind of
meeting, called a process-oriented
meeting, knowledge is shared and
information is exchanged. Such


meetings take place on a" regularly
scheduled basis. The purpose of the
second kind of meeting is to solve a
specific problem. Meetings of this
sort, called mission-oriented,
frequendy produce a decision. They
are ad hoc affairs, not scheduled
long in advance, because they
usually can't be.


Process-Oriented Meetings


To make the most of this kind of
meeting, we should aim to infuse it
with regularity. In other words, the
people attending should know how
the meeting is run, what kinds of
substantive matters are


discussed^d what is to be
accomplished. It should be designed
to allow a manager to "batch"
transactions, to use the same
"production" set-up time and effort
to take care of many similar
managerial tasks. Moreover, given
the regularity, you and the others
attending can begin to forecast the
time required for the kinds of work
to be done. Hence, a "production
control" system, as recorded on
various calendars, can take shape,
which means that a scheduled
meeting will have minimum impact
on other thins:s people are doing.


At Intel we use three kinds of


process-oriented meetings: the oneon-one, the staff meeting, and the
operation review.


ONE-ON-ONES
