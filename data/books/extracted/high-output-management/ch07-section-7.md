formance of his group tightly. He
also proceeded to look at other
avenues that could help him in the
longer term, such as splitting the
job of completing some of the work


with other similar marketing
groups in the company and
eliminating any duplication of
effort between them. Finally Bruce
initiated a request to increase the
size of his organization. His plan—
and the obvious reality that full
convergence between his tasks and
his capabilities was not possible
even after going the extra mile—
would lay the basis for his request.


Let's illustrate with another
example. Our middle manager
Cindy, the manufacturing process
engineer whom we've met before, is
responsible for maintaining and
improving the process by which


complex microchips are produced in
a plant. She defines her
environment as a collection of
"objects" and "influences." The
"objects" are new processes and
manufacturing tools that have not
yet been tested in production. The
"influences" are the people who can
affect her work directly or
indirectly. Development engineers,
for example, would like her to
require less experimentation and
documentation before she chooses
to implement new processes they
have developed. Meanwhile,
production engineers would like her
to provide more experimentation


and documentation on these same
new processes. And finally, there
are the product engineers eager to
get chips out the door who need her
help to do that, along with other
members of the production team
who put pressure on her to ensure
that the new processes are
manufacturable and the new
manufacturing tools work as soon
as they are put to use. Cindy herself
works like a consultant, advising
each group influencing her about
whether something can go into
production—the chief coordinator
for the set of events required to put
a product, a process, or a tool on


stream. Her "customer" is the
production area itself, and her
"vendors" are the engineering
groups from production,
development, and product
engineering.

HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


108


Analyzing her present status, Cindy
found that the data and
experimentation she needed from
the development group always
came in incomplete. Looking into


matters further, she found that
providing complete data and
adhering to schedules were not
really high on the development
engineers' set of priorities.
Determining where she needed to
go, it was clear to Cindy that she
must have all future new processes
and production machinery tested,
debugged, demonstrated, and, most
important, accompanied by the
necessary data for them to be
accepted and used by the
production engineers, who had
become more demanding because
of past problems.


Cindy then defined her strategy—


her plan of action— to get there.
She specified exactly what steps had
to be completed before any new
process was to be implemented or
tool deployed. Then she used time
offsets (remember the breakfast
factory) to determine when each
step needed to be done in order for
her entire plan to be completed on
time. Next, she got the manager of
the development engineers to agree
to her detailed sc^me. She
negotiated with him what she had
to dn and what they had to do-and
by what date—in order to meet what
became the mutually agreed-upon
goals. Finally, to ensure that she


stayed on track, she decided to
monitor all of her "vendors" on a
weekly basis. She wouia aiso
publish their performance against
the schedule to motivate them to
meet key dates (an indicator) and

lorteJL fUtUn eVCmS - 1 have seen
far ^0 ™"Y people who upon
recognizing today's gap try very


hard


to determine what decision has to
be made to close it. But today's gap
represents a failure of planning
sometime in the past. By analogy,
forcing ourselves to concentrate on
the decisions needed to fix today's
problem is like scurrying after our
car has already run out of gas.
Clearly we should have filled up
earlier. To avoid such a fate,
remember that as you plan you
must answer the question: What do
I have to do today to solve—or
better, avoid— tomorrow's
problem?


Thus, the true output of the
planning process is the set of tasks
it causes to be implemented. The
output of Intel's annual plan, for
instance, is the actions taken and
changes prompted as a result of the
thinking process that took place
throughout the organization. I, for
one, hardly ever look at the bound
volume finally called the Annual
Plan. In other words, the output of
the planning process is the
decisions made and the actions
taken as a result of the process.


How far ahead should the planners
look? At Intel, we put ourselves
through an annual strategic long

range planning effort in which we
examine our future five years off.
But what is really being influenced
here? It is the next y ear — an d
only the next year. We will have
another chance to replan the second
of the five years in the next year's
long-range planning meeting, when
that year will become the first year
of the five. So, keep in mind that
you implement only that portion of
a plan that lies within the time
window between now and the next
time you go through the exercise.
Everything else you can look at
again. We should also be careful not
to plan too frequently, allowing


ourselves time to judge the impact
of the decisions we made and to

determine whether our decisions
were on the right track or not. In
other words, we need the feedback
that will be indispensable to our
planning the next time around.


Who should be involved in the
planning process? The operating
management of the organization.
Why? Be

cause the idea that planners can be
people apart from uiose
implementing the plan simply does
not work. Plan-mng cannot be made
a separate career but is instead a


~ey managerial activity, one with
enormous leverage through its
impact on the future performance
of an organization. But this leverage
can only be realized through a
marriage, and a good collaborative
one at that, between planning and
implementation


Finally remember that by saying
"yes»-to projects, a course of action,
or whatever-you are implidd/saying
no to something else. Each time

2. How will I pace myself to see if I
am getting there? (The answer gives
us milestones, or key results. )


To illustrate an objective and a key
result, consider the following: I
want to go to the airport to catch a
plane in an hour. That is my
objective. I know that I must drive
through towns A, B, and C on my
way there. My key results become
reaching A, B, and C in 10, 20, and
30 minutes respectively. If I have
been driving for 20 minutes and
haven't yet made town A, I know
I'm lost. Unless I get off the
highway and ask someone for
directions, I probably won't make


my flight.


Upon what time period should an
MBO system focus? MBO is largely
designed to provide feedback
relevant to the specific task at hand;
it should tell us how we are doing
so we can make adjustments in
whatever we are doing if need be,
such as getting off the highway and
asking for directions. For the
feedback to be effective, it must be
received very soon after the activity
it is measuring occurs. Accordingly,
an MBO system should set
objectives for a relatively short
period. For example, if we plan on a
yearly basis, the corresponding


MBO system's time frame should
be at least as often as quarterly or
perhaps even monthly.


The one thing an MBO system
should provide par excellence is
focus. This can only happen if we
keep the number of objectives
small. In practice, this is rare, and
here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to
our inability to say "no"—in this
case, to too many objectives. We
must realize—and act on the
realization—that if we try to focus
on everything, we focus on nothing.
A few extremely well-chosen
objectives impart a clear message
about what we say "yes" to and


what we say "no" to— which is what
we must have if an MBO system is
to work.


TWO CASE HISTORIES


To familiarize ourselves with the
MBO system, let's look at a case
history, Columbus' discovery of the
New World though how I tell the
story takes considerable liberties
wun me grammar-school version of
the event. Thanks to its annual
planning process of 1491, the
government of Spain concluded that
it could not continue a war everybody felt was utterly necessary
unless money became available to


buy weapons and ammunition.
Since pushing me Moors out of
Spain was the supreme goal of
Queen Isabella's government, the
Queen needed the uuias to ao it.
Isabella decided she would get
money by dramatically improving
Spain's foreign trade balance, one
men talked to her subordinateChristopher Co-lumbus-and told
him about her objective. Columbus
agreed to thmk about various ways
to do what she wanted and after a

time Went back to her with ^v^l
suggestions, which included finding
pirate-free passage to x.ng.anu and
perhaps finding a new route to the


Ori-ent.Isabella and Columbus
discussed the entire matter .reeiy
eventually reaching a clear decision
that he would look tor a new route

to the East.


Once the decision was made,
Columbus began to think of all the
things that he would need to do to
accomDlish nis intent In MBO
terms, the Queen defined her^ovm
objective (increase Spain's wealth);
Columbus and rtw> Queen men
agreed upon his objective (find a
new route to the Orient). Columbus
then went on to formulate the key
results by which he would pace
himself, which in-c.u.eu outaimng


several ships, training crews,
conducting^ shakedown cruise,
setting sail, and so forth, with eacu
possessing a specific deadline.


The relationship between Isabella's
and Columbus' oujectives is dear.
The Queen wanted to increase her
nation s wealth, while Columbus
wanted to find a safe traae route to
the Orient. And we see a nesting
hierarchy


of objectives: if the subordinate's
objectives are met, the supervisor's
will be as welL


Now, the key results can come in


like clockwork, but the objectives
can still be missed. For Columbus,
the key results were relatively easy
to achieve, but he most certainly did
not find a new trade route to China,
and therefore failed to meet his
objective.


Did Columbus perform well even
though he failed by strict MBO
terms? He did discover the New
World, and that was a source of
incalculable wealth for Spain. So it
is entirely possible for a
subordinate to perform well and be
rated well even though he missed
his specified objective. The MBO
system is meant to pace a person—


to put a stopwatch in his own hand
so he can gauge his own
performance. It is not a legal
document upon which to base a
performance review, but should be
just one input used to determine
how well an individual is doing. If
the supervisor mechanically relies
on the MBO system to evaluate his
subordinate's performance, or if the
subordinate uses it rigidly and
forgoes taking advantage of an
emerging opportunity because it
was not a specified objective or key
result, then both are behaving in a
petty and unprofessional fashion.


Let's illustrate the workings of the


MBO system using the decision
about Intel's plant expansion in the
Philippines. The Far East
construction manager had an
objective that read "Obtain decision
on Philippine plant expansion/' The
key results supporting the objective
were: 1) Do a study of land
availability near the present plant
and at other acceptable locations by
June. 2) Do financial analyses
showing the trade-offs between
land costs and construction costs,
as well as the operating costs
associated with the two locations.
3) Present the results to the plant
location steering group, and obtain


a decision from them. 4) Have
Grove ratify the decision by Octo=
ber.


Each key result was accomplished
and the objective


was met. Note that the objective is
relatively short-range and the key
results are so specific that a person
knows without question whether he
has completed them and done it on
time or not. Accordingly, to be
useful a key result must contain
very specific wording and dates, so
that when deadline time arrives,
there is no room for ambiguity.


As you might have guessed, the Far
East construction manager's
supervisor had an objective that
read "Ensure that all plant
expansion projects stay on
schedule." To support this objective
he in turn had a key result, much
like his subordinate's objective, that
said "Obtain Philippine plant
expansion decision by October."


You can now see, I hope, the
parallels between how Isabella's
government and Intel work. A
manager's objectives are supported
by an appropriate set of key results.
His objectives in turn are tied to his
supervisor's objectives so that if the


manager meets his objectives, his
supervisor will meet his. But the
MBO system cannot be run
mechanically by a computer. The
system requires judgment and
common sense to set the hierarchy
of objectives and the key results
that support them. Both judgment
and common sense are also
required when using MBO to guide
you in your work from one day to
the next.


Part Three


TEAM


OF TEAMS


The


Breakfast Factory


Goes National


We left the breakfast factory as it
was enjoying great success—so
great, in fact, that we had to install
a continuous egg-boiling unit at
considerable expense. The
equipment produced breakfasts of
unprecedented uniformity.
Moreover, our volume grew to the
point where we could use the eggboiling unit at full capacity: hence,
our cost of delivering outstanding
breakfasts steadily declined. We


passed on some of the savings to
our customers, and soon the
reputation of our breakfasts spread.


Like good entrepreneurs, we knew
we had a good thing going and
started another branch of the
Breakfast Factory across town (we
even named it that). This too
became a remarkable success. Soon
thereafter Neighborhood Gourmet,
a magazine with a large national
circulation, ran a story on our
operation. We decided to seize the
opportunity and franchise the
Breakfast Factory nationwide. We
rapidly moved into neighborhoods
with the right demographic mix for


our breakfasts, and we were soon
enough running a vast network of
Breakfast Factories.


Before long we found, however, that
the network required a set of tasks
and skills very different from those
needed to run our one restaurant.
The most important


of these was to figure out how to
use the advantages made possible
by having a local entrepreneur set
up and run each franchise without
losing the enormous economies of
scale that became available to us.
Because the local manager knows
his neighborhood, he can adapt his


operation to it and so, we hope,
operate the most profitable
franchise possible. At the same
time, with over a hundred Breakfast
Factories, our purchasing power is
immense. If we centralize certain
activities, we are in a position to do
many things much better and much
less expensively than each of our
franchises could do individually.
And most important, because the
quality of our breakfasts has played
a major role in our success so far,
we have to be very concerned about
maintaining a perception of firstrate food and service. In other
words, we could not permit any one


Breakfast Factory branch or those
in any region to jeopardize the real
secret of our business.


In fact, the centralizationdecentralization dichotomy is so
pervasive that it has become one of
the most important themes in the
management of our network. Do
we, for instance, want to advertise
locally or nationally? Do we want to
give the local manager the control
over advertising in his community?
We don't know who reads the Daily
Bktt, and he probably does. Do we
want to give him the right to hire
and fire personnel? Should we let
him set his wage scale, or do we


want to impose one nationally? The
latter hardly makes sense, since
labor market conditions vary
considerably from region to region.
But we do want to buy our
sophisticated automatic machinery
centrally. After all, it has taken us a
long time to develop suitable
vendors and the capacity to test the
incoming machines given our
demanding requirements. We now
have a sizable group of people doing
only that in Chicago, and we hardly
want each branch or even each
region to duplicate the effort.


But I don't think we should buy all
our eggs in Chi

cago. We want them to be fresh,
and we don't want to truck this
delicate commodity all over the
country. Neither do we want to have
each branch set up its own
incoming egg inspection operation.
Here some kind of compromise
makes sense, such as regional egg
purchasing centers, with each only
a few hours by truck from all the
franchise locations in the region.
We do want uniform, high-quality
standards everywhere and we will
monitor each of the franchises to
make sure that they are adhered to.
In other words, we definitely want
to impose national quality control


standards.


What about items on the menu? By
and large we want to keep the same
core menu everywhere—people
going into the Breakfast Factory
should be able to count on some

basic choices. But we should also
recognize regional differences in
culinary taste, so some discretion
ought to be left to the individual
franchises.


What about real estate? Should we

allow our Breakfast Factories to be
housed in any locally available
building? Or should we prescribe a
uniform construction style and


build each of them from the ground
up? Perhaps we should go with
whatever building is available
provided it meets some standards
we set in Chicago.


What about furniture? Does it have
to be utterly uniform? Should
Chicago buy furniture for all
branches? What about tableware?
Since people tend to associate what
they eat with and from with the
breakfast, we should probably use
the same tableware all over the
country, which means we might as
well purchase all that at one place
too. But it is ridiculous for a local
operation in Montana to requisition


Chicago for a few broken plates. So
we should probably have a couple of
regional warehouses from which
tableware could be delivered
quickly.


How do we choose the location of

new franchises within each
metropolitan area? Should we make
the decisions in Chicago? Should I
decide as the CEO of the Breakfast
Factory Corporation or should the
corporate


staff let the local branch manager
decide? Or perhaps Chicago should
decide after consulting with the
regional managers, who, after all,


know their own areas better than
my staff and I do.


Things have become very
complicated. Sometimes as I sit
behind my big desk at corporate
headquarters, I wish I could go back
to the early days when I was getting
the eggs and toast and pouring the
coffee myself. Or if not that, at least
back to the days when I was
running a single Breakfast Factory,
and I knew everybody by name and
could make all the decisions
without having to struggle with a
mountain of pros and cons. Then
"there was virtually no overhead.
Now there's a corporate personnel


manager. There's also a traffic
manager, who wants to buy a
computer to optimize the flow of
eggs from the regional centers to
the individual franchises. He says
he can minimize transportation
costs while ensuring same-day
delivery. He also claims that if he
had this computer, he could keep
the tableware inventory at the
lowest possible level. It won't be
long before we'll have a corporate
manager for real estate
acquisitions. Very complicated
indeed.


Earlier, we established the fact that
the game of management is a team


game: a manager's output is the
output of the organizations under
his supervision or influence. We
now discover that management is
not just a team game, it is a game in
which we have to fashion a team of
teams, where the various individual
teams exist in some suitable and
mutually supportive relationship
with each other.

Hybrid Organizations


What happened to the Breakfast
Factory has to happen, or has
already happened, to every


reasonably large organization.


Most middle managers run
departments that are a part of a
larger organization. The "black
boxes'' they oversee are connected
to other black boxes in much the
same way that the Breakfast
Factories are linked to each other

and to the main office. So let us
look more carefully at what
happens within an organization
composed of smaller units.


Though most are mixed,
organizations can come in two
extreme forms: in totally missionoriented form or in totally


functional form. The Breakfast
Factory Corporation could be
organized in one or the other
extreme form, as shown on the next
page. In the mission-oriented
organization (a), which is
completely decentralized, each
individual business unit pursues
what it does—its mission—with
little tie-in to other units. Here,
each Breakfast Factory is
responsible for all elements of its
operation: determining its own
location and constructing its own
building, doing its own
merchandising, acquiring and
maintaining its own personnel, and


doing its own purchasing. In the
end it submits monthly financial

ments to the corporate executive
office.


At the other extreme is the totally
functional organization (b), which
is completely centralized. In a
Breakfast Factory Corporation set
up this way, the merchandising
department is responsible for


merchandising at all loca~ tions;
the staff of the personnel
organization hires, fires, and
evaluates personnel at all branches;
and so on.


The desire to give the individual
branch manager the power to
respond to local conditions moves
us toward a mission-oriented
organization. But a similarly
legitimate desire to take advantage
of the obvious economies of scale
and to increase the leverage of the
expertise we have in each
operational area across the entire
corporation would push us toward a
functional organization. In the real


world, of course, we look for a
compromise between the two
extremes. In fact, the search for the
appropriate compromise has
preoccupied managers for a long,
long time. Alfred Sloan summed up
decades of experience at General
Motors by saying, "Good
management rests on a
reconciliation of centralization and
decentralization." Or, we might say,
on a balancing act to get the best
combination of responsiveness and
leverage.


Let's now look at Inters
organization form, as shown on the
next page. We are a hybrid


organization. Our hybrid nature
comes from the fact that the form
of the overall corporate
organization results from a mix of
the business divisions, which are
mission-oriented, and the
functional groups. This is much like
the way I imagine any army is
organized. The business divisions
are analogous to individual fighting
units, which are provided with
blankets, paychecks, aerial
surveillance, intelligence, and so
forth by the functional
organizations, which supply such
services to all fighting units.
Because each such unit does not


have to maintain its own support
groups, it can concentrate on a
specific mission, like taking a hill in
a batde. And for that, each unit has
all the necessary freedom of action
and independence.


The functional groups can be
viewed as if they were internal
subcontractors. Let's take a sales
organization as an example. Though
a lot of companies use outside sales
representatives, an internal group
presumably provides the service at
less expense and with greater
responsiveness. Likewise,
manufacturing- finance, or data
processing can all be regarded as


functional groups, which, as

Intel is a hybrid organization:


balancing to get the best
combination of responsiveness and
leverage.


internal subcontractors, provide
services to all the business units.


Some two thirds of Intel's
employees work in the functional
units, indicating their enormous
importance. What are some of the
advantages of organizing so much
of the company in such groups? The
first is the economies of scale that

can be achieved. Take the case of
computerized information
processing. Complex com

puter equipment is very expensive,
and the capacity of large electronic
machines can be best used if all the

various business units draw from

them. If each unit had its own
computer, very expensive
equipment would be sitting idle
much of the time. Another
important advantage is that
resources can be shifted and
reallocated to respond to changes in
corporate-wide priorities. For
instance, because manufacturing is
organized functionally, we can
change the mix of product being
made to match need as perceived by
the entire corporation. If each


business unit did its own
manufacturing, shifting capacity
away from one unit to another
would be a cumbersome and sticky
exercise. And the advantage here is
that the expertise of specialists—
know-how managers, such as the
research engineers v/ho work in
technology development—can be
applied across the breadth of the
entire corporation, giving their
knowledge and work enormous
leverage. Finally, Inters functional
groups allow the business units to
concentrate on mastering their
specific trades rather than having to
worry about computers, production,


technology, and so forth.


Having so much of Intel organized
in functional units also has its
disadvantages. The most important
is the information overload hitting
a functional group w T hen it must
respond to the demands made on it
by diverse and numerous business
units. Even conveying needs and
demands often becomes very
difficult—a business unit has to go
through a number of management
layers to influence decision-making
in a functional group. Nowhere is
this more evident than in the
negotiations that go on to secure a
portion of centralized—and limited


—resources of the corporation, be it
production capacity, computer time,
or space in a shared building.
Indeed, things often move beyond
negotiation to intense and open
competition among business units
for the resources controlled by the
functional groups. The bottom line
here is that both the negotiation
and competition waste time and


energy because neither contributes
to the output or the general good of
the company.


What are some of the advantages of
organizing much of a company in a
mission-oriented form? There is


only one. It is that the individual
units can stay in touch with the
needs of their business or product
areas and initiate changes rapidly
when those needs change. That is it
All other considerations favor the
functional-type of organization. But
the business of any business is to
respond to the demands and needs
of its environment, and the need to
be responsive is so important that it
always leads to much of any
organization being grouped in
mission-oriented units.


Countless managers have tried to
find the best mix of the two
organizational forms. And it's been


no different at Intel, among senior
management and throughout the
ranks of hundreds of middle
managers, who from time to time
attempt to improve the organization
of the groups they supervise. But no
matter how many times we have
examined possible organizational
forms, we have always concluded
that there is simply no alternative
to the hybrid organizational

structure.


So that is how Intel is organized
today. To further my case that
hybrid organizations are inevitable,
consider a press release that I read
recently. One of dozens that show


up in the weekly trade newspapers,
it is reproduced here with only the
names changed.
