Introduction


Let me begin by telling you what
this book is not about. There's not a
sentence in it about bits and bytes,
RAMs and ROMs, or anything else
remotely technical or arcane, even
though Intel, where I work, is a
"high-tech," Silicon Valley company.
As a practitioner of the art of
management, I've tried instead to
lay out what I think constitutes a
good, solid management approach.
From my experience at Intel, this
consists of energetic and committed
people sitting down together,


looking at problems, and figuring
out ways to solve them. So myjob in
the book is to provide you with
basic ideas, clear principles, and
specific techniques you can use in
your own managerial
circumstances.


I am especially eager to reach the
middle manager, the usually
forgotten man or woman of any
organization. The first-line
supervisor on the shop floor and
the chief executive officer of a
company are both well appreciated.
You'll find many courses designed
to teach the former the
fundamentals of his work, while


practically all of our leading
business schools are set up to turn
out the latter. But between the two
is a large group of people, the
middle managers, who supervise
the shop-floor fore

INTRODUCTION


man, or who work as engineers,
accountants, and sales
representatives. Middle managers
are the muscle and bone of every
sizable organization, but they are
largely ignored despite their
immense importance to our society
and economy.


Middle managers are not confined
to big corporations. In fact, they can
be found in almost any business
operation. If you run a small tax
department at a law firm, you are a
middle manager. The same is true if
you are a school principal, an owner
of a distributorship, or a small-town
insurance agent. When people from
each of these enterprises read the
manuscript, their reactions
confirmed what I suspected: the
broad applicability of the
managerial ideas that were
developed at Intel as it grew from a
very small to a very large
organization.


Another group should be included
among middle managers—people
who may not supervise anyone
directly but who even without strict
organizational authority affect and
influence the work of others. These
know-how managers are sources of
knowledge, skills, and
understanding to people around
them in an organization. They are
specialists and experts of some sort
who act like consultants to other
members of the organization.
Teachers, market researchers,
computer mavens, and traffic
engineers shape the work of others
through their know-how just as


much as or more than the
traditional manager using
supervisory authority. Thus a knowhow manager can be legitimately
called a middle manager. In fact,
the more our world becomes
information- and service-oriented,
the more importance know-how
managers will acquire as members
of middle management. In short,
know-how managers should read

on.


At various times you will take
exception to what you read. "This
may be fine at Intel," you will say,
"but it


would never fly at PDQj where I
work. Nothing does until the Old
Man himself decrees it. Short of a
palace revolution, I can't use
anything you recommend." Let me
assure you that you will be able to
use most of what I say. As a middle
manager, of any sort, you are in
effect a chief executive of an
organization yourself Don't wait for
the principles and the practices you
find appealing or valid to be
imposed from the top. As a micro
CEO, you can improve your own
and your group's performance and
productivity, whether or not the
rest of the company follows suit.


The book contains three basic ideas.
The first is an output-oriented
approach to management. That is to
say, we apply some of the principles
and the discipline of the most
output-oriented of endeavors—
manufacturing — to other forms of
business enterprise, including most
emphatically the work of managers.
Consider Intel, which is a true
manufacturing and production
company, making highly complex
silicon chips as well as
computerlike products built from
them. Our company now has about
20,000 employees. Of these, 8,000
actually work to make the products.


Another 3,000 help them, as they
supervise the personnel, maintain
the machines, engineer, and
improve the manufacturing process.
Another 5,000 work in
administration, where they
schedule pro-auction, keep
personnel records, send bills to our
customers, and pay our suppliers.
Finally, some 4,000 design new
products, take them to the
marketplace, sell them, and service
them after the sale.


As we founded, organized, and
managed Intel, we found that all
our employees "produce" in some
sense —some make chips, others


prepare bills, while still others
create software designs or
advertising copy. We also found
that when we approached any work
done at Intel with this basic
understanding in mind, the
principles and discipline of
production gave us a systematic
way of


XU INTRODUCTION


managing it, much as the language
and concepts of finance created a
common approach to evaluating
and managing investments of any

sort.


2 The second idea is that the work
of a business, of a government
bureaucracy, of most forms of
human activity, is something
pursued not by individuals but by
teams. This idea is summed up in
what I regard as the


^ single most important sentence of
this book: The output of a manager
is the output of the organizational
units under his supervision or
influence. The question then
becomes what can managers do to
increase the output of their teams.
Put another way, what specifically
should they be doing during the day
when a virtually limitless number


of possible tasks calls for their
attention? To give you a way to
answer the question, I introduce
the concept oimanagerial leverage,
which measures the impact of what
managers do to increase the output
of their teams. High managerial
productivity, I argue, depends
largely on choosing to perform
tasks that possess high leverage.


- — A team will perform well only if
peak performance is elicited from
the individuals in it. This is the

third idea of the book. Can business

use whatever it is that motivates an
athlete to put out his "personal
best" consistently? I think business


can, which is why I examine the
sports analogy and the role of
something called task-relevant
feedback to get and to sustain a
high level of performance from the
members of a business team.


I am an engineer by training and a
manager of a high-technology
company by profession. As a
manager, I am also a member of
that group>—many millions strong
just in the United States—which
holds the key to increased
productivity: more and better goods
and services to meet people's needs.
I am an optimist and believe our
potential to increase our wealth has


hardly been tapped! I also strongly
believe that applying the methods
of production,


exercising managerial leverage, and
eliciting an athlete's desire for peak
performance can help nearly
everyone— lawyers, teachers,
engineers, supervisors, even book
editors; in short, middle managers
of all kinds—to work more
productively.


So, let us begin by taking a field trip
to a factory . . .


Part One


THE


BREAKFAST


FACTORY


1


The Basics of Production:
Delivering a Breakfast


(or a College Graduate,


or a Compiler, or a Convicted
Criminal...)


The Three-Minute Egg


To understand the principles of


production, imagine that you're a
waiter, which I was while I went to
college, and that your task is to
serve a breakfast consisting of a
three-minute soft-boiled egg,
buttered toast, and coffee. Your job
is to prepare and deliver the three
items simultaneously, each of them
fresh and hot.


The task here encompasses the
basic requirements of production.
These are to build and deliver
products in response to the
demands of the customer at a
scheduled delivery time, at an
acceptable quality level, and at the
lowest possible cost. Production's


charter cannot be to deliver

whatever the customer wants
whenever he wants it, for this
would require an infinite
production capacity or the
equivalent—very large, ready-todeliver inventories. In our example,
the customer may want to have a
perfect three-minute egg with hot
buttered toast and steaming coffee
waiting for him the moment he sits
down. To fulfill such an
expectation, you would either have
to have your kitchen idle and poised
to serve the customer whenever he
drops in, or have a ready-to-con

HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


sume inventory of perfectly boiled
eggs, hot buttered toast, and coffee.
Neither is practical.


Instead, a manufacturer should
accept the responsibility of
delivering a product at the time
committed to —in this case, by
implication, about five to ten
minutes after the customer arrives

at our breakfast establishment. And

we must make our breakfast at a

cost that enables us to sell it at a
competitive price and still make an
acceptable profit. How are we going
to do this in the most intelligent
way? We start by looking at our
production flow.


The first thing we must do is to pin
down the step in the flow that will
determine the overall shape of our
operation, which we'll call the
limiting step. The issue here is
simple: which of the breakfast
components takes the longest to
prepare? Because the coffee is
already steaming in the kitchen and
the toast takes only about a minute,
the answer is obviously the egg, so
we should plan the entire job
around the time needed to boil it.
Not only does that component take
the longest to prepare, the egg is
also for most customers the most
important feature of the breakfast.


What must happen is illustrated
opposite. To work back from the
time of delivery, you'll need to
calculate the time required to
prepare the three components to
ensure that they are all ready
simultaneously. First you must
allow time to assemble the items on
a tray. Next you must get the toast
from the toaster and the coffee
from the pot, as well as the egg out
of the boiling water. Adding the
required time to do this to the time
needed to get and cook the egg
defines the length of the entire
process—called, in production
jargon, the total throughput time.


Now you come to the toast. Using
the egg time as your base, you must
allow yourself time to get and toast
the slices of bread. Finally, using
the toast time as your base, you can
determine when you need to pour
the coffee. The

key idea is that we construct our
production flow by starting with the
longest (or most difficult, or most
sensitive, or most expensive) step
and work our way back. Notice
when each of the three steps began
and ended. We planned our flow
around the most critical step—the
time required to boil the egg—and
we staggered each of the other steps
according to individual throughput
times; again in production jargon,
we offset them from each other.


The idea of a limiting step has very
broad applicability. Take, for
example, the need to recruit college
graduates to work for Intel. Certain


of our managers visit the colleges,
interview some of the seniors, and
invite the more promising
candidates to visit the company. We
bear the expense of the candidates'
trip, which can be considerable.
During the trip, the students are
closely interviewed by other
managers and technical people.
After due consideration,
employment is offered to some of
the students whose skills and
capabilities match our needs


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


best, and those who accept the
offers eventually come to work for


the company.


To apply the basic principle of
production, you need to build the
sequence here around its most
expensive feature, which is the
students' trip to the plant, thanks to
the cost of travel and the time that
Intel managers spend with the
candidates. To minimize the use of
this step per final college hire, we
obviously have to increase the ratio
of accepted offers to applicants
invited to visit the plant, which we
do by using phone interviews to
screen people before issuing
invitations. The technique saves
money, substantially increases the


ratio of offers extended per plant
visit, and reduces the need to use
the expensive limiting step per hire.


The principle of time offsets is also
present here. Working back from
the time the students will graduate,
the recruiter staggers the various
steps involved to allow time for
everything—on-campus interviews,
phone screening, plant visits—to
take place at the appropriate times
during the months preceding
graduation.


Production Operations


Other production principles


underlie the preparation of our
breakfast. In the making of it, we
find present the three fundamental
types of production operations:
process manufacturing, an activity
that physically or chemically
changes material just as boiling
changes an egg; assembly, in which
components are put together to
constitute a new entity just as the
egg' the toast, and the coffee
together make a breakfast; and test,
which subjects the components or
the total to an examination of its
characteristics. There are, for
example, visual tests made at points
in the breakfast production Dro

cess: you can see that the coffee is
steaming and that the toast is
brown. Process, assembly, and test
operations can be readily


The Basics of Production j


applied to other very different kinds
of productive work. Take, for
instance, the task of training a sales
force to sell a new product. The
three types of production
operations can be easily identified.
The conversion of large amounts of
raw data about the product into
meaningful selling strategies
comprehensible to the sales
personnel is a process step, which


transforms data into strategies. The
combination of the various sales
strategies into a coherent program
can be compared to an assembly
step. Here the appropriate productselling strategies and pertinent
market data (such as competitive
pricing and availability) are made to
flow into one presentation, along
with such things as brochures,
handouts, and flip charts. The test
operation comes in the form of a
"dry run" presentation with a
selected group of field sales
personnel and field sales
management. If the dry run fails
the test, the material must be


"reworked" (another wellestablished manufacturing concept)
to meet the concerns and objections
of the test audience.


The development of a "compiler," a
major piece of computer software,
also demonstrates process,
assembly, and test. A computer
understands and uses human
instruction only if it receives such
instruction in its own language. A
compiler is an interpreter, enabling
the computer to translate into its
language material written in terms
and phrases resembling English.
With a compiler, a programmer can
think more or less like a human


being rather than having to adapt
himself to the way the computer
processes information. The task of
getting a machine to interpret and
translate in this fashion is
obviously formidable; thus the
development of a compiler takes
strenuous effort on the part of
skilled and gifted software
engineers. The effort, however, is
justified by the simplification it
brings to computer use.


In any case, the development of the
individual pieces out of which a
compiler is built represents a series
of processing steps. Actual working
pieces of software are


generated out of specifications and
basic design know-how. Each piece
then undergoes an individual
operation called a "unit test." When
one fails, the defective portion of
the software is returned to the
process phase for "rework." After all
the pieces pass their respective unit
tests, they are assembled to form
the compiler. Then, of course, a
"system test" is performed on the
complete product before it is
shipped to the customer. Time
offsets are used extensively in the
task. Because throughput times for
the various engineering steps are
well established, the timing of the


releases of various bodies of
software from one stage to another
can all be calculated and staged in
advance.


Breakfast preparation, college
recruiting, sales training, and
compiler design are very much
unlike one another, but all of them
possess a basically similar flow of
activity to produce a specific output.


A Few Complications


Real life, as you know, is full of
thickets and underbrush. In a
schematic flow chart, our breakfast
operation assumed infinite capacity,


meaning that nobody had to wait
for an available toaster or for a pot
to boil an egg in. But no such ideal
world exists. What would happen if
you had to stand in a line of waiters,
waiting for your turn to use the
toaster? If you didn't adjust your
production flow to account for the
queue, your three-minute egg could
easily become a six-minute egg. So
limited toaster capacity means you
have to redo your flow around the
new limiting step. The egg still
determines the overall quality of
the breakfast, but your time offsets
must be altered. How would our
model reflect the change in


manufacturing flow? Working back
from the time of breakfast delivery,
let's see how the production is
affected, as illustrated opposite. The
egg cycle remains the same, as does
the one for coffee. But limited
toaster capacity makes for


The Basics of Production g


quite a difference. Now you must
account for the delivery time of the
toast and the wait for a free toaster.
This means the whole production
process has to be conceived
differently. Toaster capacity has
become the limiting step, and what
you do has to be reworked around


it.

With limited toaster capacity,
making the toast becomes the
limiting step.


Now let's complicate things a little
further. What happens if you are
stuck in line waiting for a toaster
when it's time to start boiling your
egg? Your conflict is seemingly
irreconcilable, but it really isn't. If


you were managing the restaurant,
you could turn your personnel into
specialists by hiring one egg-cooker,
one toast=maker, one coffeepourer, and one person to supervise
the operation. But that, of course,
creates an immense amount of
overhead, probably making it too
expensive to consider.


If you were a waiter, you could ask
the waiter in line next to you to
help out—to put your toast in while
you ran off to start your egg. But
when you have to depend on
someone else, the results are likely
to be less predicta

lO HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


ble. As the manager, you could add
another toaster, but this becomes
an expensive addition of capital
equipment You could run the
toaster continuously and build up
an inventory of hot toast, throwing
away what you can't use but always
having immediate access to
product. That means waste, which
can also become too expensive for
the operation. But at least you know
that alternatives do exist:
equipment capacity, manpower, and
inventory can be traded* off against
each other and then balanced
against delivery time.


Because each alternative costs
money, your task is to find the most
cost-effective way to deploy your
resources— the key to optimizing
all types of productive work. Bear in
mind that in this and in other such
situations there is a right answer,
the one that can give you the best
delivery time and product quality at
the lowest possible cost. To find
that right answer, you must develop
a clear understanding of the tradeoffs between the various factors—
manpower, capacity, and inventory
—and you must reduce the
understanding to a quantifiable set
of relationships. You probably won't


use a stopwatch to conduct a timeand-motion study of the person
behind a toaster; nor will you
calculate the precise trade-off
between the cost of toast inventory
and the added toaster capacity in
mathematical terms. What is
important is the thinking you force
yourself to go through to
understand the relationship
between the various aspects of your
production process.


Let's take our manufacturing
example a step further and turn our
business into a high-volume
breakfast factory operation. First,
you buy a continuous egg-boiler


that will produce a constant supply
of perfectly boiled three-minute
eggs. It will look something like
what's drawn in the figure opposite.
Note that our business now
assumes a high and predictable
demand for three-minute eggs; it
cannot now readily provide a fourminute egg, because automated
equipment is not very flexible.
Second, you


match the output of the continuous
egg-boiler with the output of a
continuous toaster, as specialized
personnel load each piece of
equipment and deliver the product.
We have now turned things into a


continuous operation at the
expense of flexibility, and we can no
longer prepare each customer's
order exactly when and how he
requests it. So our customers have
to adjust their expectations if they
want to enjoy the benefits of our
new mode: lower cost and more
predictable product quality.


vO,—^^rv


1


The continuous egg-boiler: a
constant supply of three-minute

eggs.


But continuous operation does not
automatically mean lower cost and
better quality. What would happen
if the water temperature in the
continuous egg-boiler quietly went
out of specification? The entire
work-in-process—all the eggs in the
boiler—and the output of the
machine from the time the
temperature climbed or dropped to
the time the malfunction was

discovered becomes unusable. All


the toast is also wasted because you
don't have any eggs to serve with it.
How do you minimize the risk of a
breakdown of this sort? Performing
afunctional test is one way. From
time to time you open an egg as it
comes out of the machine and
check its quality. But you will have
to throw away the egg tested. A
second way involves in-process
inspection, which can take many
forms. You could, for example,
simply insert a thermometer into
the water so that the temperature


could be easily and frequently
checked. To avoid having to pay
someone to read the thermometer,


you could connect an electronic
gadget to it that would set off bells
anytime the temperature varied by
a degree or two. The point is that
whenever possible, you should
choose in-process tests over those
that destroy product.


What else could go wrong with our
continuous egg-machine? The eggs
going into it could be cracked or
rotten, or they could be over- or
undersized, which would affect how
fast they cook. To avoid such
problems, you will want to look at
the eggs at the time of receipt,
something called incoming or
receiving inspection. If the eggs are


unacceptable in some way, you are
going to have to send them back,
leaving you with none. Now you
have to shut down. To avoid that,
you need a raw material inventory.
But how large should it be? The
principle to be applied here is that
you should have enough to cover
your consumption rate for the
length of time it takes to replace
your raw material. That means if
your egg man comes by and delivers
once a day, you want to keep a day's
worth of inventory on hand to
protect yourself. But remember,
inventory costs money, so you have
to weigh the advantage of carrying a


day's supply against the cost of
carrying it. Besides the cost of the
raw material and the cost of money,
you should also try to gauge the
opportunity at risk: what would it
cost if you had to shut your egg
machine down for a day? How
many customers would you lose?
How much would it cost to lure
them back? Such questions define
the opportunity at risk.


Adding Value


All production flows have a basic
characteristic: the material becomes
more valuable as it moves through
the process. A boiled egg is more


valuable than a raw one, a fully
assembled breakfast is more
valuable than its constituent parts,
and finally, the breakfast placed in
front of


the customer is more valuable still.
The last carries the perceived value
the customer associates with the

establishment when he drives into
the parking lot after seeing the sign
"Andy's Better Breakfasts."
Similarly, a finished compiler is
more valuable than the constituent
parts of semantic analysis, code
generation, and run time, and a
college graduate to whom we are
ready to extend an employment


offer is more valuable to us than
the college student we meet on
campus for the first time.


A common rule we should always
try to heed is to detect and fix any
problem in a production process at
the lowest-value stage possible.
Thus, we should find and reject the
rotten egg as it's being delivered
from our supplier rather than
permitting the customer to find it.
Likewise, if we can decide that we
don't want a college candidate at the
time of the campus interview rather
than during the course of a plant
visit, we save the cost of the trip
and the time of both the candidate


and the interviewers. And we
should also try to find any
performance problem at the time of
the unit test of the pieces that make
up a compiler rather than in the
course of the test of the final
product itself.


Finally, at the risk of being
considered hard-hearted, let's
examine the criminal justice system
as if it were a production process
aimed at finding criminals and
putting them into jail. The
production begins when a crime is
reported to the police and the police
respond. In many instances, after
some questions are asked, no


further action can be taken. For
those crimes which the police can
pursue, the second step is more
investigation. But the case often
ends here for lack of evidence,
complaints being dropped, and so
on. If things move to the next stage,
a suspect is arrested, and the police
try to find witnesses and build a
case, hoping to get an indictment.
Once again, an indictment is often
not returned because of insufficient
evidence. For the cases that actually
do go


'4 HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


found not guilty; sometimes the


case is dismissed. But when a
conviction is secured, the process
moves to the sentencing and
appeals round. At times a person
found guilty of a crime will be given
a suspended'sentence and
probation, and at others the
conviction will be overturned on
appeal. For the small fraction that
remains, the final stage is jail.


If we make some reasoned
assumptions about the percentages
that move forward at each stage and
the costs associated with each, we
arrive at some striking conclusions.
If we compile the cost of the effort
that goes into securing a conviction


and assign it only to those criminals
who actually end up in jail, we find
that the cost of a single conviction
works out to be well over a million
dollars—an absolutely staggering
sum. The number is so high, of
course, because only a very small
percentage of the flow of accused
persons makes it all the way
through the process. Everyone
knows that prisons are
overcrowded, and that many
criminals end ud serving shorter jail
terms or no jail terms at all because
cells are in such short supply. So a
terribly expensive trade-off results,
violating the most important


production principles. The limiting
step here should clearly be
obtaining a conviction. The
construction cost of a jail cell even
today is only some $80,000. This,
plus the $10-20,000 it costs to keep
a person in jail for a year, is a small
amount compared to the million
dollars required to secure a
conviction. Not to jail a criminal in
whom society has invested over a
million dollars for iacK ot an
$80,000 jail cell clearly misuses
society's total investment in the
criminal justice system. And this
happens oecause we permit the
wrong step (the availability ot jail


cells) to limit the overall process.

Managing the Breakfast Factory




Indicators as a Key Tool


A hungry public has loved the
breakfast you've been serving, and
thanks to the help of your many
customers and a friendly banker,
you've created a breakfast factory,
which among other things uses
specialized production lines for
toast, coffee, and eggs. As manager


of the fac |


tory, you have a substantial staff
and a lot of automated 1


equipment. But to run your
operation well, you will need a set
of good indicators, or
measurements* Your output, of
course, is no longer the breakfasts
you deliver personally but rather all
the breakfasts your factory delivers,
profits generated, and the
satisfaction of your customers. Just
to get a fix on your output, you need
a number of indicators; to get
efficiency and high output, you
need even more of them. The


number of possible indicators you
can choose is virtually limitless, but
for any set of them to be useful, you
have to focus each indicator on a
specific operational goal.


Let's say that as manager of the
breakfast factory, you will work
with five indicators to meet your
production goals on a daily basis.
Which five would they be? Put
another way, which five pieces of
information would you


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


waut tu look at each day,
immediately upon arriving at your


office?


Here are my candidates. First, you'll
want to know your sales forecast for
the day. How many breakfasts
should you plan to deliver? To
assess how much confidence you
should place in your forecast, you
would want to know how many you
delivered yesterday compared to
how many you planned on
delivering—in other words, the
variance between your plan and the
actual delivery of breakfasts for the
preceding day.


Your next key indicator is raw
material inventory. Do you have


enough eggs, bread, and coffee on
hand to keep your factory running
today? If you find you have too
little inventory, you can still order
more. If you find you have too
much, you may want to cancel
today's egg delivery. Another
important piece of information is
the condition of your equipment. If
anything broke down yesterday, you
will want to get it repaired or
rearrange your production line to
meet your forecast for the day.


You also must get a fix on your
manpower. If two waiters are out
sick, you will have to come up with
something if you are still going to


meet the demand forecasted.
Stiould you call in temporary help?
Should you take someone off the
toaster line and make him a waiter?


finally, you want to have some kind
of quality indicator. It is not enough
to monitor the number of
breakfasts each waiter delivers,
because the waiters could have

been rude to the customers even as
they served a record number of
breakfasts. Because your business
depends on people wanting what
you sell, you must be concerned
with the public's opinion of your
service. Perhaps you should set up a
"customer complaint log"


maintained by the cashier. If one of
your waiters elicited more than the
usual number of complaints
yesterday, you will want to speak to
him first thing today.


All these indicators measure factors
essential to running your factory. If
you look at them early every day,


you will often be able to do
something to correct a potential
problem before it becomes a real
one during the course of the day.


Indicators tend to direct your
attention toward what they are
monitoring. It is like riding a


bicycle: you will probably steer it
where you are looking. If, for
example, you start measuring your
inventory levels carefully, you are
likely to take action to drive your
inventory levels down, which is
good up to a point. But your
inventories could become so lean
that you can't react to changes in
demand without creating shortages.
So because indicators direct one's
activities, you should guard against
overreacting. This you can do by
pairing indicators, so that together
both effect and counter-effect are
measured. Thus, in the inventory
example, you need to monitor both


inventory levels and the incidence
of shortages. A rise in the latter will
obviously lead you to do things to
keep inventories from becoming too
low.


The principle here was evident
many times in the development of a
compiler. Measuring the
completion date of each software
unit against its capability is one
example. Watching this pair of
indicators should help us to avoid
working on the perfect compiler
that will never be ready, and also to
avoid rushing to finish one that is
inadequate. In sum, joint
monitoring is likely to keep things


in the optimum middle ground.


Nowhere can indicators—and paired
indicators—be of more help than in
administrative work. Having come
to this realization, our company has
been using measurements as a key
tool to improve the productivity of
administrative work for several
years. The first rule is that a
measurement—any measurement—
is better than none. But a genuinely
effective indicator will cover the
output of the work unit and not
simply the activity involved.
Obviously, you measure a salesman
by the orders he gets (output), not
by the calls he makes (activity).


The second criterion for a good
indicator is that what


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


you measure should be a physical,
countable thing. Examples of
effective measures of
administrative output are snuwn
below. Because those listed here are
all quantity or output indicators,
their paired counterparts should
stress the quality of work. Thus, in
accounts oavable. the number of
vouchers processed should be
paired with the number of errors
found either by auditing or bv our
suppliers. For another example, the


number of square feet cleaned by a
custodial group should be paired
with a partially objective/partially
subjective rating of the quality of
work as assessed by a senior
manager with an umce in that
building.

Such indicators have many uses.
First, they spell out very clearly


what the objectives of an individual
or eronn are. Second, they provide a
degree of objectivity when
measuring an administrative
function. Third, and as important as
any, they give us a measure by
which various administrative
groups performing the same
function in different organizations
can be compared with each other.

group in a second building. In fact,
if indicators are put in place, the
competitive spirit engendered
frequently has an electrifying effect
on the motivation each group
brings to its work, along with a
parallel improvement in
performance. More about this later
when we examine the "sports
analogy,"


The Black Box


We can think of our breakfast
factory as if it were a "black box":
input (the raw materials) and the
labor of waiters, helpers, and you,
the manager, flowing into the box,


and the output (the breakfast)
flowing out of it as illustrated
below. In general, we can represent
any activity that resembles a
production process in a simple
fashion as


Raw Material


Breakfast


Labor


The breakfast factory — as a "black

a black box. Thus, we can draw a
black box to represent college
recruiting, where the input is the
applicants on campus and the
output is college graduates who
have accepted our employment
offers. The labor is the work of our
on-campus interviewers and the
managers and technical people who
interview back at the plant.
Similarly, the process of field sales
training can be seen as a black box
with the input being the raw
product specifications and the
output being trained sales


personnel. The labor here is the
work of the mar

HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


keting and merchandising people
who turn raw information into

usable sales tools and train the field
sales personnel to exploit them. In
fact, we can represent most, if not
all, administrative work by our
magical black box. A group whose
job is to bill customers has as its
input the information about the
customer—what he has purchased,
the pricing data, and the shipment
records; and output is the final bill
sent to the customer through which


payment is collected. The labor is
the work of all personnel involved.


The black box sorts out what the
inputs, the output, and the labor are
in the production process. We can
improve our ability to run that
process by cutting some zvindows
in our box so that we can see some
of what goes on within it. By
looking through the openings, as
illustrated below, we can better
understand the internal workings of
any production process and assess
what the future output is likely to
be.


By peering through the xrindows in
the black box, we can get an idea of
what the future output is likely to
be.


Leading indicators give you one way
to look inside the black box by
showing you in advance what the
future might look like. And because
they give you time to take corrective
action, they make it possible for you
to avoid problems. Of course, for


leading indicators to do you any
good, you must believe in their
validity. While this may seem
obvious, in practice, confidence is
not as easy to come by as it sounds.
To take big, costly, or worrisome


Managing the breakfast Factory


21


steps when you are not yet sure you
have a problem is hard. But unless
you are prepared to act on what
your leading indicators are telling
you, all you will get from
monitoring them is anxiety. Thus,
the indicators you choose should be


credible, so that you will, in fact, act
whenever they flash warning
signals.


Leading indicators might include
the daily monitors we use to run
our breakfast factory, from machine
downtime records to an index of

customer satisfaction—both of
which can tell us if problems lie
down the road. A generally
applicable example of a "window* 5
cut into the black box is the
linearity indicator. In the figure
below, we provide one for the
college recruiting process. Plotted
here is the number of college
graduates who have accepted our


offers versus the month of the year.
If all went ideally, we would move
along the straight line that would
yield our hiring target for the
semester by the month of June. If
by April the actual progress is as
shown here, we will find ourselves
far below the ideal straight line. So

The linearity indicator can give us
an early warning that we are likely
to miss our target


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


from reading the indicator, we
know that the only way we can hit
our target is by getting acceptance
at a much higher rate m the
remaining two months than we had
gotten in the preceding four. Thus,
the linearity indicator Hashes an
early warning, allowing us time to
take corrective action. Without it,
we would discover that we Had
missed our target in June, when
nothing can be done about it.


If we consider a manufacturing unit
in this fashion, we may assume that
because it makes monthly goals
regularly all is well. But we can cut
a window into the black box here,


measure production output against
time as the month proceeds, and
compare that with the ideal linear
output. We may learn that output
performance is soread evenly
throughout the course of the month
or that it is concentrated in the last

week of the month. If the latter is
tne case, the manager of the unit is
probably not using manpower and
equipment efficiently. And if the
situation is not remedied, one
minor breakdown toward month s

end could cause the unit to miss its
monthlv output goal entirely. The
linearity indicator will help you
anticipate such a problem and is

Another sound way to anticipate the
future is through


the use of the stagger chart, which
forecasts an output over

23


the next several months. The chart
is updated monthly, so that each


month you will have an updated
version of the then-current forecast
information as compared to several
prior forecasts. You can readily see
the variation of one forecast from
the next, which can help you
anticipate future trends better than
if you used a simple trend chart.


In my experience, nowhere has the
stagger chart been more productive
than in forecasting economic
trends. The way it works is shown
in the figure below, which gives us
forecasted rates of incoming orders
for an Intel division* The stagger
chart then provides the same
forecast prepared in the following


month, in the month after that, and
so on. Such a chart shows not only
your outlook for business month by
month but also how your outlook

/ have found the "stagger chart" the

varied from one month to the next.
This way of looking at incoming
business, of course, makes whoever
does the forecasting take his task


very seriously, because he knows
tuat nis torecast for any given
month will be routinely compared
with future forecasts and eventually
with the accuai result. But even
more important, the improvement
or deterioration of the forecasted

outlook from one month to the next
provides the most valuable
indicator of business trends that I
have ever seen. I would go as rar as
to say that it's too bad that all
economists" and investment
advisers aren't obliged to display
their fore-casts in a stagger chart
form. Then we could really have a
way to evaluate whatever any one of


them chooses to sav. finally,
indicators can be a big help in
solving all types of Problems. If
something goes wrong, you will
have a bank of information that
readily shows all the parameters of
your operation, allowing you to
scan them for unhealthy departures
from the norm. If you do not
systematically collect and maintain
an archive of indicators, you will
have to do an awful lot of quick
research to get ~e information you
need, and by the time you have it,
the problem is likely to have gotten

worse.


Controlling Future Output


There are two ways to control the
output of any factory. Some
industries build to order. For
example, when vn„ L Mopping tor a
sofa, you are going to have to wait a
long


ZZT\T l ?° U ^ Ught ' UnIeSS ^ bu ?
il right off ET™ u A fUmitUre
GuXor y Mds to order. When it
kams what you want, the factory
looks for a hole in its


manufacturing schedule and makes
the item for you If you order a new
car rather than buying one right off
the ot, the same thing happens: the
plant will paint the car m he color


you want and provide the options
you want out you wiH have to wait
for it. And our breakfa t factory" of
course, builds breakfasts to order.


But if your competition in the sofa
business makes the same product
but has it ready in four weeks while
you need four months, you are not
going to have many customers. So
even though you would much
rather build to order, you will have
to use another way to control the
output of your factory. In short, you
will have to build to forecast, which
is a contemplation of future orders.
To do this, the manufacturer sets
up his activities around a reasoned


speculation that orders will
materialize for specific products
within a certain time.


An obvious disadvantage here is
that the manufacturer takes an
inventory risk. Since the forecast is
an assessment of future
requirements, which the
manufacturer commits resources to
satisfy, the factory could be in an
immense amount of trouble if the
orders do not materialize or if they
materialize for a product other than
the one anticipated. In either case,
unwanted inventory is the result.
To build to forecast, you risk capital
to respond to anticipated future


demand in good order.


At Intel, we build to forecast
because our customers demand that
we respond to their needs in a
timely fashion, even though our
manufacturing throughput times
are quite long. Our breakfast factory
makes its product to customer
order, but buys from its suppliers—
like the egg man—on the basis of
forecasted demand. Similarly, most
companies recruit new college
graduates to fill anticipated needs—
rather than recruiting only when a
need develops, which would be
foolish because college graduates
are turned out in a highly seasonal


fashion. Computer software
products, such as compilers, are
also typically developed in response
to an anticipated market need
rather than to specific customer
order. So "building" to forecast is a
very common business practice.


Delivering a product that was built
to forecast to a customer consists of
two simultaneous processes, each
with a separate time cycle. A
manufacturing flow must


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


occur in which the raw material
moves through various production


steps and finally enters the finished
goods warehouse, as illustrated
below. Simultaneously, a salesman
finds a prospect and sells to that
prospect, who eventually places an
order with the manufacturer.
Ideally, the order for the product
and the product itself should arrive
on the shipping dock at the same
time.


Because the art and science of
forecasting is so complex, you
might be tempted to give all
forecasting responsibility to a single
manager who can be made
accountable for it. But this usually
does not work very well. What


works better is to ask both the
manufacturing and the sales
departments to prepare a forecast,
so that people are responsible for
performing against their own
predictions.


At Intel we try to match the two
parallel flows with as much
precision as possible. If there's no
match, we end up with a customer
order that we can't satisfy or with a
finished product for which we have
no customer. Either way we have
problems. Obviously, if the match
does come off, with a forecasted
order becoming a real order,


The order for the product and the
product itself should arrive at the
shipping dock at the same time.


the customer's requirements can be
nicely satisfied with the factory's
product delivery.


The ideal is rarely found in the real
world. More often, customer orders
don't develop in time or the
customer changes his mind. As for
the other flow, manufacturing could
miss deadlines, or make mistakes,
or encounter unforeseen problems.
Because neither the sales flow nor
the manufacturing flow is
completely predictable, we should


deliberately build a reasonable
amount of "slack" into the system.
And inventory is the most obvious
place for it. Clearly, the more
inventory we have, the more change
we can cope with and still satisfy
orders. But inventory costs money
to build and keep, and therefore
should be controlled carefully.
Ideally, inventory should be kept at
the lowest-value stage, as we've
learned before, like raw eggs kept at
the breakfast factory. Also, the
lower the value, the more
production flexibility we obtain for
a given inventory cost.


It is a good idea to use stagger


charts In both the manufacturing
and sales forecasts. As noted, they
will show the trend of change from
one forecast to another, as well as
the actual results. By repeatedly
observing the variance of one
forecast from another, you will
continually pin down the causes of
inaccuracy and improve your ability
to forecast both orders and the
availability of product.


Forecasting future work demands
and then adjusting the output of an
"administrative factory" represents
a very important way in which its
productivity can be increased.
Though an old and honored way of


operating "widget factories," the
application of forecasting
techniques is hardly common as a
way to control administrative work.
Such work has up to now been
considered qualitatively different
from work in a widget factory, and
has also lacked objective
performance standards needed to
size or scale the work unit.


But if we have carefully chosen
indicators that char

*8 HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


acterize an administrative unit and
watch them closely, we are ready to


apply the methods of factory
control to administrative work. We
can use de facto standards, inferred
from the trend data, to forecast the
number of people needed to
accomplish various anticipated
tasks. By rigorous application of the
principles of forecasting, manpower
can be reassigned from one area to
another, and the headcount made to
match the forecasted growth or
decline in administrative activity.
Without rigor, the staffing of
administrative units would always
be left at its highest level and, given
Parkinson's famous law, people
would find ways to let whatever


they're doing fill the time available
for its completion. There is no
question that having standards and*
believing in them and staffing an
administrative unit objectively
using forecasted workloads will
help you to maintain and enhance
productivity.


Assuring Quality


As we have said, manufacturing's
charter is to deliver product at a
quality level acceptable to the
customer at minimum cost. To
assure that the quality of our
product will in fact be acceptable,
all production flows, whether they


"make" breakfasts, college
graduates, or software modules,
must possess inspection points. To
get acceptable quality at the lowest
cost, it is vitally importantto reject
defective material at a stage where
its accumulated value is at the
lowest possible level. Thus, as
noted, we are better off catching a
bad raw egg than a cooked one, and
screening out our college applicant
before he visits Intel. In short,
reject before investing further
value.


In the language of production, the
lowest-value-point inspection
where we inspect raw material is


called incoming material inspection
or receiving inspection. If we again
use a black box to represent our
production process,inspections that
occur at intervening points within it
are called.


Managing the Breakfast Factory


29


logically enough, in-process
inspections. Finally, the last
possible point of inspection, when
the product is ready to be shipped
to the customer, is called final
inspection or outgoing quality
inspection. The three types are


depicted below.


From supplier


To customer


In-Process


Inspection


The key principle is to reject the
defective "material" at its lowestvalue stage.


When material is rejected at
incoming inspection, a couple of
choices present themselves. We can
send it back to the vendor as


unacceptable, or we can waive our
specifications and use the
substandard material anyway. The
latter would result in a higher reject
rate in our production process than
if we had used thoroughly
acceptable material, but that might
be less expensive than shutting
down the factory altogether until
our vendor provides better material.
Such decisions can only be made
properly by a balanced group of
managers, which typically consists
of representatives from the quality
assurance, manufacturing, and
design engineering departments.
This group can weigh all the


consequences of rejecting or
accepting substandard raw material.


While in most instances the
decision to accept or reject defective
material at a given inspection point
is an economic one, one should
never let substandard material


proceed when its defects could
cause a complete failure -a re MU y

put because we can never assess the
consequences of an unreli-a^e

cess. A monitor produces no
comparable slowdown but might let
some bad material escape before we
can act on the monitor's results and
shut things down, which means
that we might have to reject
material later at a higher-value
stage. Clearly, for the same money
we can do a lot more monitoring


than gate-type inspections; if we do
the former, we may well contribute
more to the overall quality of the
product than if we choose less
frequent gatelike inspections. The
trade-off here is not obvious, and
any choice has to be made with a
specific case in mind. As a rule of
thumb, we should lean toward
monitoring when experience shows
we are not likely to encounter big
problems.


Another way to lower the cost of
quality assurance is to use variable
inspections. Because quality levels
vary over time, it is only common
sense to vary how often we inspect.


For instance, if for weeks we don't
find problems, it would seem logical
to check less often. But if problems
begin to develop, we can test ever
more frequently until quality again
returns to the previous high levels.
The advantage here is still lower
costs and even less interference
with the production flow. Yet this
approach is not used very often,
even in widget manufacturing. Why
not? Probably because we are
creatures of habit and keep doing
things the way we always have,
whether it be from week to week or

year to year.


Suitably thought through,


intelligent inspection schemes can
actually increase the efficiency and
productivity of any manufacturing
or administrative process. Let's take
an example very different from the
making of widgets or breakfasts.


I recently read a story in a news
magazine that said that the
American Embassy in London could
not deal with a deluge of visa
applications. Some one million
Britons apply for visas each year, of
which about 98 percent are
approved. The embassy employs
sixty people, who process as many
as 6,000 applications a day. Most
applica

tions are received by mail, and at
any time, from 60,000 to 80,000
British passports are in the
embassy's hands. Meanwhile, lines
of one hundred or more British and

other nationals stand in front of the
building, looking for an opportunity
to walk their passports through.
The embassy has tried a number of
ways to handle matters more
efficiently, including newspaper
advertisements asking tourists to
apply early and to expect a threeweek turn" around. The embassy
also installed boxes where
applicants could drop off their
passports and visa applications if


they really needed same-day
service. Even so, the lines at the
embassy remained long.


In fact, the embassy's expediting
schemes onlv made the problem
worse, because nothing was done to
address the basic issue: to speed the
processing of visas overall. Time
and money were spent to classify
various kinds of applications slated
for different processing- times, but
this only created more logistical
overhead with no effect on output.


If our government wants British
tourists to visit the United States,
our government should not irritate


these would-be visitors. And if the
embassy can't get the money to
increase its staff, a simple solution
can be borrowed from basic
production techniques. We need, in
short, to replace their present
scheme with a oualitv'as-surance

test.


For that, the bureaucratic minds at
the embassy would need to accept
that a 100 percent check of the visa
applicants is unnecessary. Some 98
percent of those applying are
approved without any question. So
if the embassy were to institute a
sampling test of visas (a quality
assurance test), and a thorough one


at that, the logjam of applications
could be broken without materially
increasing the chance that the
undesirable will enter our county.
Moreover, the embassy could select
the sample to be checked according
to predetermined criteria. The visa
processing could then work rather
like the Internal Reve

nue Service. Through the checks
and audits that the IRS performs,
that government agency induces
compliance among most taxpayers
without having an agent look at
every single return.


Later, when we examine managerial


productivity, we'll see that when a
manager digs deeply into a specific
activity under his jurisdiction, he's
applying the principle of variable
inspection. If the manager
examined everything his various
subordinates did, he would be
meddling, which for the most part
would be a waste of his time. Even
worse, his subordinates would
become accustomed to not being
responsible for their own work,
knowing full well that their
supervisor will check everything out
closely. The principle of variable
inspection applied to managerial
work nicely skirts both problems,


and, as we shall see, gives us an
important tool for improving
managerial productivity.


Productivity


The workings of our black box can
furnish us with the simplest and
most useful definition of
productivity. The productivity of
any function occurring within it is
the output divided by the labor
required to generate the output.
Thus, one way to increase
productivity is to do whatever we
are now doing, but faster. This
could be done by reorganizing the
work area or just by working


harder. Here we've not changed
what work we do, we've just
instituted ways to do it faster—
getting more activities per
employee-hour to go on inside the
black box. Because the output of the
black box is proportional to the
activity that occurs within it, we will
get more output per hour. There is a
second way to improve productivity.
We can change the nature of the
work performed: what we do, not
how fast we do it. We want to
increase the ratio of output to
activity, thereby increasing output
even if the activity per employeehour remains the same. As the


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT

Productivity can be increased by


performing the work activities at a
higher rate ...


IOUTRjf >


C^>


or by increasing the leverage of the
activities.


slogan has it, we want to "work
smarter, not harder/' Here I'd like
to introduce the concept of
leverage, which is the output
generated by a specific type of work
activity. An activity with high
leverage will generate a high level
of output; an activity with low
leverage, a low-level of output. For
example, a waiter able to boil two
eggs and operate two toasters can
deliver two breakfasts for almost

the same amount of work as one.


His output per activity, and
therefore his leverage, is high. A
waiter who can handle only one egg
and one toaster at a time possesses
lower output and leverage. The
software engineer using a
programming language rather like
English, later to be translated by a
compiler, can solve many problems
per hour of programming. His
output and leverage are high. A
software engineer using a more
cumbersome programming method
of ones and zeros will require many
more hours to solve the same
number of problems. His output
and leverage are low. Thus, a very


important way to increase
productivity is to arrange the work
flow inside our black box so that it
will be characterized by high output
per activity, which is to say highleverage activities.


Automation is certainly one way to
improve the leverage of all types of
work. Having machines to help
them, human beings can create
more output. But in both widget
manufacturing and administrative
work, something else can also
increase the productivity of the
black box. This is called work
simplification. To get leverage this
way, you first need to create a flow


chart of the production process as it
exists. Every single step must be
shown on it; no step should be
omitted in order to pretty things up
on paper. Second, count the number
of steps in the flow chart so that
you know how many you started
with. Third, set a rough target for
reduction of the number of steps. In
the first round of work
simplification, our experience
shows that you can reasonably
expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction.


To implement the actual
simplification, you must question
why each step is performed.
Typically, you will find that many


steps exist in your work flow for no
good reason. Often they are there
by tradition or because formal
procedure ordains it, and nothing
practical requires their inclusion.
Remember, the "visa factory" at our
embassy in Britain didn't really
have to process 100 percent of the
applicants. So no matter what
reason may be given for a step, you
must critically question each and
throw out those that common sense
says you can do without. We found
that in a wide range of
administrative activities


at Intel, substantial reduction—
about 30 percent could


be achieved in the number of steps
required to perform various tasks.


Of course, the principle of work
simplification is hardly new in the
widget manufacturing arts. In fact,
this is one of the things industrial
engineers have been doing for a
hundred years. But the application
of the principle to improve the
productivity of the "soft
professions"— the administrative,
professional, and managerial
workplace—is new and slow to take
hold. The major problem to be
overcome is defining what the
output of such work is or should be.
As we will see, in the work of the


soft professions, it becomes very
difficult to distinguish between
output and activity. And as noted,
stressing output is the key to
improving productivity, while
looking to increase activity can
result in just the opposite.

What Is a Manager's Outputf


I asked a group of middle managers
just that question. I got these

responses:


judgments and opinions


direction


allocation of resources


mistakes detected


personnel trained and subordinates
developed


courses taught


products planned


commitments negotiated


Do these things really constitute
the output of a manager? I don't
think so. They are instead activities,
or descriptions of what managers
do as they try to create a final
result, or output. What, then, is a
manager's output? At Intel, if he is
in charge of a wafer fabrication
plant, his output consists of
completed, high-quality, fully
processed silicon wafers. If he
supervises a design group, his


output consists of completed
designs that work correctly and are
ready to go into manufacturing. If a
manager is the principal of a high
school, his output will be trained


and educated students who have
either completed their schooling or
are ready to move on to the next
year of their studies. If a manager is
a surgeon, his output is a fully
recovered, healed patient. We can
sum matters up with the
proposition that:


The output of his organization A
manager's output = +


The output of the neighboring
organizations under his influence


Why? Because business and
education and even surgery
represent work done by teams.


A manager can do his "own" job, his
individual work, and do it well, but
that does not constitute his output.
If the manager has a group of
people reporting to him or a circle
of people influenced by him, the
manager's output must be
measured by the output created by
his subordinates and associates. If
the manager is a knowledge
specialist, a know-how manager, his


potential for influencing
"neighboring" organizations is
enormous. The internal consultant
who supplies needed insight to a
group struggling with a problem
will affect the work and the output
of the entire group. Similarly, if a
lawyer acquires a regulatory permit
for a drug company, he will release
the flow of the result of many years
of research at that company to the
public. Or a marketing analyst who
reviews mountains of product,
market, and competitive
information, analyzes market
research, and makes fact-finding
visits can direcdy affect the output


of many "neighboring"
organizations. His interpretations
of the data and his
recommendations will perhaps
guide the activities for the whole
company. Thus, the definition of
"manager" should be broadened:
individual contributors who gather
and disseminate know-how and

information should also be seen as
middle managers, because they
exert great power within the
organization.


But the key definition here is that
the output of a manager is a result
achieved by a group either under
his supervision or under his


influence. While the manager's own
work is clearly very important, that
in itself does not create output. His
organization does. By analogy, a
coach or a quarterback alone does
not score touchdowns and win
games. Entire teams with their
participation and guidance and
direction do. League standings are
kept by team, not by individual.
Business—and this means not just
the business of commerce but the
business of education, the business
of government, the business of
medicine—is a team activity. And,
always, it takes a team to


win,


It is important to understand that a
manager will find himself engaging
in an array of activities in order to
affect output. As the middle
managers I queried said, a manager
must form opinions and make
judgments, he must provide
direction, he must allocate
resources, he must detect mistakes,
and so on. All these are necessary to
achieve output. But output and
activity are by no means the same
thing.


Consider my own managerial role.
As president of a company, I can
affect output through my direct
subordinates—group general


managers and others like them— by
performing supervisory activities. I
can also influence groups not under
my direct supervision by making
observations and suggestions to
those who manage them. Both
types of activity will, I hope,
contribute to my output as a
manager by contributing to the
output of the company as a whole. I
was once asked by a middle
manager at Intel how I could teach
in-plant courses, visit
manufacturing plants, concern
myself with the problems of people
several levels removed from me in
the organization, 11 and still have


time to do my job. I asked him what
he thought my job was. He thought
for a moment, and then answered
"his own question, "I guess those
things are your job too, aren't
they?" They are absolutely my


job—not my entire job, but part of
it, because they help add to the
output of Intel.


Let me give another example.
Cindy, an engineer at Intel,
supervises an engineering group in
a wafer fabrication plant. She also
spends some of her time as a
member of an advisory body that
establishes standard procedures by


which all the plants throughout the
company perform a certain
technical process. In both roles,
Cindy contributes to the output of
the wafer fabrication plants. As a
supervising engineer, she performs
activities that increase the output of
the plant in which she works; as a
member of the advisory body, she
provides specialized knowledge that
will influence and increase the
output of "neighboring
organizations"—all the other Intel
wafer fabrication plants.


Let's refer again to our black box. If
the machinery within an
organization can be compared to a


series of gears, we can visualize
how a middle manager affects
output. In times of crisis, he
provides power to the organization.
When things aren't working as
smoothly as they should, he applies
a bit of oil. And, of course, he
provides intelligence to the
machine to direct its purpose.


"Daddy, What Do You Really Dot"


Most of us have had to struggle to
answer that nu^Hnn What we
actually do is difficult to pin down
and sum up. Much of it often seems
so inconsequential that our position
in the business hardly seems


justified. Part of the problem here
stems from the distinction between
our activities, which is what we
actually do, and our output, winch
is what we achieve. The latter
seems important, significant, and
worthwhile. The former often
seems trivial, insignificant, and
messy. But a surgeon whose output
is a cured patient spends" his time
scrubbing and cutting auu suturing,
and this hardly sounds very
respectable either.

To find out what we managers
really do, let's take a look at one of
my busier days, shown in the table
below. Here I describe the activity
in which I was engaged, explain it a
bit, and categorize it into types we
shall examine in the balance of the
chapter.

members of the audience.


The presentation indicated that the

represented only informationgathering; no further action was
stimulated.)

up with my own schedule, as well as
with my staff, and to nudge them
into doing a better job supporting
the foreign training program.


The bulk of the meeting involved
getting sufficient information on
the status of the product and the
corrective action that had been
implemented (infamatim-gather

dedsion made by the division
manager, with my concurrence, to
resume shipment of the product.

I was a role model not only in
communicating the importance we
place on training, but also, by my
handling of questions and
comments, in representing, in living
form, some of the values of the
company. The nature of the
questions, at the same time, gave
me a feeling for the concerns and
understanding level of a large
number of employees to whom I
would not otherwise have access. So
this also represented informationgathering, characteristic of the
"visit" type in its efficiency. 4:00

gathering, interspersed with

through my annotations and
messages scribbled on much of it.


When you look at what happened,
you won't see any obvious patterns.
I dealt with things in seemingly
random fashion. My wife's reaction
to my day was that it looked very
much like one of her own. She was
right in noting a similarity. My day
always ends when I'm tired and
ready to go home, not when I'm
done. I am never done. Like a
housewife's, a manager's work is
never done. There is always more to
be done, more that should be done,
always more than can be done.


A manager must keep many balls in
the air at the same time and shift
his energy and attention to
activities that will most increase the
output of his organization. In other
words, he should move to the point
where his leverage will be the
greatest.


As°you can see, much of my day is
spent acquiring information. And as
you can also see, I use many ways
to get it. I read standard reports and
memos but also get information ad
hoc. I talk to people inside and
outside the company, managers at
other firms or financial analysts or
members of the press. Customer


complaints, both external and
internal, are also a very important

To improve and maintain your
capacity to get information, you
have to understand the way it
comes to you. There's a hierarchy
involved. Verbal sources are the
most valuable, but what they
provide is also sketchy, incomplete,
and sometimes inaccurate, like a
newspaper headline that can give
you only the general idea of a story.
A headline can't give any of the
details and might even give you a
distorted idea of what the real story
is. So you then read the newspaper
article itself to find out who, what,


where, why, and how. After this,
you should have some reiteration
and perspective, which can be
compared to reading a news
magazine or even a book. Each level
In your information hierarchy Is
Important, and you can rely on
none alone. Though the most
thorough information might come
from the news magazine, you do
not, of course, want to wait a full
week after an event to find out

about it. Your information sources
should complement one another,
and also be redundant because that
gives you a way to verify what
you've learned.


There is an especially efficient way
to get information, much neglected
by most managers. That is to visit a
particular place in the company and
observe what's going on there. Why
should you do this? Think of what
happens when somebody comes to
see a manager in his office. A
certain stop-and-start dynamics
occurs when the visitor sits down,
something socially dictated. While a
two-minute kernel of information
Is exchanged, the meeting often
takes a half hour. But if a manager
walks through an area and sees a
person with whom he has a twominute concern, he can simply stop,


cover it, and be on his way. Ditto for
the subordinate when he initiates
conversation. Accordingly, such
visits are an extremely effective and
efficient way to transact managerial
business.


Then why are they underutilized?
Because of the awkwardness that
managers feel about walking
through an area without a specific
task in mind. At Intel we combat
this problem by using programmed
visits meant to accomplish formal
tasks, but which also set the stage
for ad hoc mini-transactions. For
example, we ask our°managers to
participate in "Mr. Clean"


inspections, in which they go to a
part of the company that they
normally wouldn't visit, lhe
managers examine the
housekeeping, the arrangement of
things, the labs, and the safety
equipment, and in so doing spend
an hour or so browsing around and
getting acquainted with things
firsthand. As can be seen from my
schedule, a manager not only
gathers information but is also a
source of it. He must convey his
knowledge to members of his own
organization and to other groups he
influences. Beyond relaying facts, a
manager must also communicate


his objectives, priorities, and
preferences as they bear on the way
certain tasks are approached. This is
extremely important, because only
if the manager imparts these will
his subordinates know how to make

decisions themselves that will be
acceptable to the manager, their
supervisor. Thus, transmitting
objectives and preferred approaches
constitutes a key to successful
delegation. As we will see later, a
snared corporate culture becomes
indispensable to a business.
Someone adhering to the values of
a corporate culture—an intelligent
corporate citizen—will behave in


consistent fashion under similar
conditions, which means that
managers don't have to suffer the
inefficiencies engendered by formal
rules, procedures, and regulations
that are sometimes used to get the
same result. 1 he third major kind
of managerialactivity, of course, is
decision-making. To be sure, once
in a while we managers m fact mate
a decision. But for every time that
nappens, we participate in the
making of many, many others, and
we do that in a variety of ways. We
orovide actual inputs or just offer
opinions, we debate the pros


and cons of alternatives and thereby


force a better decision to emerge,
we review decisions made or about
to be made by others, encourage or
discourage them, ratify or veto
them,


just how decisions should be made,
we'll talk about later. Meanwhile,
let's say that decisions can be
separated into two kinds. The
forward-looking sort are made, for
example, in the capital
authorization process, Here we
allocate the financial resources of
the company among various future
undertakings. The second type is
made as we respond to a developing
problem or a crisis, which can


either be technical (a quality
control problem, for example) or
involve people (talking somebody
out of quitting).


It's obvious that your decisionmaking depends finally on how well
you comprehend the facts and
issues facing your business. This is
why information-gathering is so
important in a manager's life. Other
activities—conveying information,
making decisions, and being a role
model for your subordinates—are
all governed by the base of
information that you, the manager,
have about the tasks, the issues, the
needs, and the problems facing your


organization. In short, informationgathering is the basis of all other
managerial work, w r hich is why I
choose to spend so much of my day
doing it.


You often do things at the office
designed to influence events
slightly, maybe making a phone call
to an associate suggesting that a
decision be made in a certain way,
or sending a note or a memo that
shows how you see a particular
situation, or making a comment
during an oral presentation. In such
instances you may be advocating a
preferred course of action, but you
are not issuing an instruction or a


command. Yet you're doing
something stronger than merely
conveying information. Let's call it
"nudging" because through it you
nudge an individual or a meeting in
the direction you would like. This is
an immensely important
managerial activity in which we


engage all the time, and it should be
carefully distinguished from
decision-making that results in
firm, clear directives. In reality, for
every unambiguous decision we
make, we probably nudge things a
dozen times. ^Finally, something
more subtle pervades the day of all
managers. While we move about,


doing what we regard as our jobs,
we are role models for people in our
organization—our subordinates, our
peers, and even our supervisors.
Much has been said and written
about a manager's need to be a
leader. The fact is, no single
managerial activity can be said to
constitute leadership, and nothing
leads as well as example. By this I
mean something straightforward.
Values and behavioral norms are
simply not transmitted easily by
talk or memo, but are conveyed
very effectively bv doinff and doing
visibly.


All managers need to act so that


they can be seen exerting influence,
but they should do so in their own
way. Some of us feel comfortable
dealing with large groups and
talking about our feelings °and
values openly in that fashion.
Others prefer working one-on-one
with people in a quieter, more
intellectual environment, lhese and
other styles of leadership will work,
but only if we recognize and
consciously stress the need for us to
be role models for people in our
organization.


Don't think for a moment that the
way I've described leadership
applies only to large operations. An


insurance agent in a small office
who continually talks with personal
friends on the phone imparts a set
of values about permissible conduct
to everyone working for him. A
lawyer who returns to his office
after lunch a little drunk does the
same. On the other hand, a
supervisor in a company,,arge or
small, who takes his work seriously
exemplifies to his associates the
most important managerial value of
all.


A great deal of a manager's work
has to do with allocating resources:
manpower, money, and capital. But
the single most important resource


that we allocate from one day to the
next is our own time. In principle

more money, more manpower, or
more capital can always be made
available, but our own time is the
one absolutely finite resource we
each have. Its allocation and use

therefore deserve considerable
attention. How you handle your
own time is, in my view, the single
most important aspect of being a
role model and leader.


As you can see, in a typical day of
mine one can count some twentyfive separate activities in which I
participated, mostly informationgathering and -giving, but also


decision-making and nudging. You
can also see that some two thirds of
my time was spent in a meeting of
one kind or another. Before you are
horrified by how much time I spend
in meetings, answer a question:
which of the activities—
information-gathering,
information-giving, decisionmaking, nudging, and being a role
model— could I have performed
outside a meeting? The answer is
practically none. Meetings provide
an occasion for managerial
activities. Getting together with
others is not, of course, an activity—
it is a medium. You as a manager


can do your work in a meeting, in a
memo, or through a loudspeaker for
that matter. But you must choose
the most effective medium for what
you want to accomplish, and that is
the one that gives you the greatest
leverage. More about meetings
later.


Leverage of Managerial Activity


We've established that the output of
a manager is the output of the
various organizations under his
control and his influence. What can
a manager do to increase his
output? To find out, let's look at the
concept of leverage. Leverage is the


measure of the output gener

ated by any given managerial
activity. Accordingly, managerial
output can be linked to managerial
activitv by the equation:


Managerial Output = Output of
organization


= L L X Ai + L 2 X A 2 + . . .


This equation says that for every
activity a manager performs—Aj, A
2, and so on—the output of the
organization should increase by
some degree. The extent to which
that output is thereby increased is


determined by tue leverage of that
activity-^, £,, and so on. A manager
s output is thus the sum of the
result of individual activities having
varying degrees of leverage. Clearly
the Key to mgh output means being
sensitive to the leverage of what
you do during the day.


Managerial productivity—that is,
the outDut of a manager per unit of
time worked—can be increased in
three ways:


i. Increasing the rate with which a
manager performs


his activities, speeding up his work.


2. Increasing the leverage
associated with the various


managerial activities. 3- Shifting the
mix of a manager's activities from
those


with lower to those with higher
leverage.


Let us consider first the leverage of
various types of managerial work.


HIGH-LEVERAGE ACnviTIES


These can be achieved in three basic

ways:


. When many people are affected by
one manager. • ..«en a person's
activity or behavior over a lon<r


period of time is affected by a
manager's brief, well"


focused set of words or actions.


- When a large group's work is
affected by an individual supplying
a unique, key piece of knowledge or
information.


The first is the most obvious
example. Consider Robin, an Intel
finance manager, responsible for
setting up the annual financial


planning process for the company.
When Robin defines in advance
exactly what information needs to
be gathered and presented at each
stage of the planning process and
lays out who is responsible for
what, she directly affects the
subsequent work of perhaps two
hundred people who participate in
the planning process. By spending a
certain amount of time in advance
of the planning activities, Robin will
help to eliminate confusion and
ambiguity for a large population of
managers over an extended period
of time. Consequently, her work
contributes to the productivity of


the entire organization and clearly
has great leverage, leverage that
depends, however, on when it is
performed. Work done in advance
of the planning meeting obviously
has great leverage. If Robin has to
scramble later to help a manager
define guidelines and milestones,
her work will clearly have much
less leverage.


Another example of leverage that
depends on timely action is what
you do when you learn that a valued
subordinate has decided to quit. In
such a case, you must direct
yourself to the situation
immediately if you want to change


the person's mind. If you put it off,
all your chances are lost. Thus to
maximize the leverage of his
activities, a manager must keep
timeliness, which is often critical,
firmly in mind.


Leverage can also be negative. Some
managerial activities can reduce the
output of an organization. I mean
something very simple. Suppose I
am a key participant at a meeting
and I arrive unprepared. Not only
do I waste the time of the people
attending the meeting because of


my lack of preparation—a direct
cost of my carelessness —but I


deprive the other participants of the
opportunity to use that time to do
something else.


Each time a manager imparts his
knowledge, skills, or values to a
group, his leverage is high, as
members of the group will carry
what they learn to many others. But
again, leverage can be positive or
negative. An example of leverage
that I hope is high and positive is
my talk in the orientation course.
During the two hours I have, I try to
impart a great deal of information
about Intel—its history, its
objectives, its values, its style—to a
group of two hundred new


employees. Besides what I say
specifically, my approach toward
answering questions and my
conduct in general communicate
our way of doing things to these
employees when they are most
impressionable.


Here is another example of this
kind of leverage. To train a group of
salesmen, Barbara, an Intel
marketing engineer, sets out to
teach them what the organization's
products are. If she does her job
well, the salespeople will be better
equipped to sell the line. If she does
it poorly, great and obvious damage
is done.


A final, less formal, example here:
Cindy, as you recall, is a member of
a technical coordinating body in
which she tries to disseminate her
understanding of a specific
technology to all of the company's
manufacturing groups. In effect,
she uses the coordinating body as
an informal training vehicle to
effect high leverage on her
counterparts in neighboring Intel
organizations.


A manager can also exert high
leverage by engaging in an activity
that takes him only a short time,
but that affects another person's
performance over a long time. A


performance review represents a
good example of this. With the few
hours' work that a manager spends
preparing and delivering the review,
he can affect the work of its
recipient enormously. Here too a
manager can exert either positive or
negative leverage. A subordinate
can be motivated and even
redirected in his efforts, or the


Managerial Leverage ay


review can discourage and
demoralize him for who knows how
long.


Another seemingly trivial piece of


work—creating a tickler file—can
improve daily work significantly for
a long time. Setting up the simple
mechanical aid is a one-time
activity, yet it is likely to improve
the productivity of the manager
who uses it indefinitely. Thus the
leverage here is very, very high.


Examples of high negative leverage
abound. After going through the
annual planning process, an Intel
manager saw that, in spite of
successful cost reduction ettorts in
the prior year, his division was still
not going to make any money in the
coming year. The manager became
depressed. Though he didn't realize


it, he "almost immediately began to
affect people around him and soon
depression spread throughout his
organization. He snapped out of it
only when someone on his staff
finally told him what he was doing
to the people under him. Another
example is waffling, when a
manager puts off a decision that
will affect the work of other people.
In effect, the lack of a decision is
the same as a negative decision; no
green light is a red light, and work
can stop for a whole organization.


Both the depressed and the waffling
manager can have virtually
unlimited negative leverage. If


people are badly affected by a poor
sales training effort, the situation
can be handled by retraining the
group. But the negative leverage
produced by depression and
waffling is very hard to counter
because their impact on an
organization is both so pervasive
and so elusive.


Managerial meddling is also an
example of negative leverage. This
occurs when a supervisor uses his
superior knowledge and experience
of a subordinate's responsibilities to
assume command of a situation
rather than letting the subordinate
work things through himself. For


example, if a senior manager sees
an indicator showing an
undesirable trend and dictates to
the person


responsible a detailed set of actions
to be taken, that is managerial
meddling. In general, meddling
stems from a supervisor exploiting
too much superior work knowledge
(real or imagined). The negative
leverage produced comes from the
fact that after being exposed to
many such instances, the
subordinate will begin to take a
much more restricted view of what
is expected of him, showing less
initiative in solving his own


problems and referring them
instead to his supervisor. Because
the output of the organization will
consequently be reduced in the long
run, meddling is clearly an activity
having negative managerial
leverage.


The third kind of managerial
activity with high leverage is
exercised by a person with unique
skills and knowledge. One such
person is an Intel marketing
engineer responsible for setting
prices for the productline-Hundreds of salespeople in the field can
be negatively affected if prices are
set too high: no matter how hard


they may try, they won't be able to
get any business. Of course, if the
prices were set too low, we would
be giving money away.


Take another example. An Intel
development engineer who has
uniquely detailed knowledge of a
particular manufacturing process
effectively controls how it is used.
Since the process will eventually
provide the foundation for the work
of many product designers all over
the company, the leverage the
development engineer exerts is
enormous. The same is true for a
geologist in an oil company or an
actuary in an insurance firm. All are


specialists whose work is important
for the work of their organization at
large. The person who comprehends
the critical facts or has the critical
insights—the "knowledge specialist"
or the "know-how manager"—has
tremendous authority and influence
on the work of others, and therefore
very high leverage.


The art of management lies in the
capacity to select from the many
activities of seemingly comparable
signifi

cance the one or two or three that
provide leverage well beyond the
others and concentrate on them.


For me, paying close attention to
customer complaints constitutes a
high-leverage activity. Aside from
making a customer happy, the
pursuit tends to produce important
insights into the workings of my
own operation. Such complaints
may be numerous, and though all of
them need to be followed up by
someone, they don't all require or
wouldn't all benefit from my
personal attention. Which one out
of ten or twenty complaints to dig
into, analyze, and follow up is
where art comes into the work of a
manager. The basis of that art is an
intuition that behind this complaint


and not the other lurk many deeper
problems.


DELEGATION AS LEVERAGE


Because managerial time has a
hierarchy of values, delegation is an
essential aspect of management.
The "delegator" and "delegatee"
must share a common information

base and a common set of
operational ideas or notions on how
to go about solving problems, a
requirement that is frequendy not
met. Unless both parties share the
relevant common base, the
delegatee can become an effective
proxy only with specific


instructions. As in meddling, where
specific activities are prescribed in
detail, this produces low managerial
leverage.


Picture this. I am your supervisor,
and I walk over to you with pencil
in hand and tell you to take it. You
reach for the pencil, but I won't let
go. So I say, "What is wrong with
you? Why can't I delegate the pencil
to you?" We all have some things
that we don't really want to delegate
simply because we like doing them
and would rather not let go. For
your managerial effectiveness, this
is not too bad so long as it is based
on a conscious decision that you


will hold on to certain tasks that
you enjoy performing, even though
you could, if


you chose, delegate them. But be
sure to know exactly what you're
doing, and avoid the charade of
insincere delegation, which can
produce immense negative
managerial leverage.


^ Given a choice, should you
delegate activities that are familiar
to you or those that aren't? Before
answering, consider the following
principle: delegation without
follow-through is abdication. You
can never wash your hands of a


task. Even after you delegate it, you
are still responsible for its
accomplishment, and monitoring
the delegated task is the only
practical way for you to ensure a
result. Monitoring is not meddling,
but means checking to make sure
an activity is proceeding in line with
expectations. Because it is easier to
monitor something with which you
are familiar, if you have a choice
you should delegate those activities
you know best. But recall the pencil
experiment and understand before
the fact that this will very likely go
against your emotional grain.


Please turn back to the table of my


day's activities on pages 43-47.
During the executive staff meeting
we heard two follow-up
presentations, one on the status of
an extremely important marketing
program and the other on the
progress of a program aimed at
reducing manufacturing throughput
times. Both reviews are examples of
monitoring. Earlier, we had
assigned each to a middle manager
and made sure these managers and
the senior staff agreed about what
the programs were to be. The
middle managers then went about
itheir business expecting to report
back to the executive staff, the body


that delegated the programs to
them.


Monitoring the results of delegation
resembles the monitoring used in
quality assurance. We should apply
quality assurance principles and
monitor at the lowest-added-value
stage of the process. For example,
review rough drafts of reports that
you have delegated; don't wait until
your subordinates have spent time
polishing


them into final form before you
find out that you have a basic
problem with the contents. A
second principle applies to the


frequency with which you check
your subordinates' work. A variable
approach should be employed,
using different sampling schemes
with various subordinates; you
should increase or decrease your
frequency depending on whether
your subordinate is performing a
newly delegated task or one that he
has experience handling. How often
you monitor should not be based on
what you believe your subordinate
can do in general, but on his
experience with a specific task and
his prior performance with it—his
task-relevant maturity, something
111 talk about in detail later. As the


subordinate's work improves over
time, you should respond with a
corresponding reduction in the
intensity of the monitoring.


To use quality assurance principles
effectively, the manager should
only go into details randomly, just
enough to try to ensure that the
subordinate is moving ahead
satisfactorily. To check into all the
details of a delegated task would be
like quality assurance testing ioo
percent of what manufacturing
turned out.


Making certain types of decisions is
something managers frequently


delegate to subordinates. How is
this best done? By monitoring their
decision-making process. How do
you do that? Let's examine what
Intel goes through to approve a
capital equipment purchase. We ask
a subordinate to think through the
entire matter carefully before
presenting a request for approval
And to monitor how good his
thinking is, we ask him quite
specific questions about his request
during a review meeting. If he
answers them convincingly, we'll
approve what he wants. This
technique allows us to find out how
good the thinking is without having


to go through it ourselves.


Increasing Managerial Activity
Rate: Speeding Up the Line


Of course, the most obvious way to
increase managerial output is to
increase the rate, or speed, of
performing work. The relationship
here is:


Managerial Output _ Activity
Performed


Time ' - L X Trn^ "


where L is the leverage of the
activity.


The most common approach to
increasing a manager's productivity
—his output over time—has been
time-management techniques,
which try to reduce the
denominator on both sides of this
equation. Any number of
consultants will tell a manager that
the way to higher productivity is to
handle a piece of paper only once,
to hold only stand-up meetings
(which will presumably be short),
and to turn his desk so that he
presents his back to the door.


These time-management
suggestions can be improved upon,
I think, by applying our production


principles. Hrst, we must identify
our limiting step: what is the ^'egg"
in our work? In a manager's life
some things really «ave to happen
on a schedule that is absolute. For
m<> an example is the class I
teach. I know when it is going to
meet, and I know I must prepare for
it. There is no


give m the time here, because over
two hundred students will be
expecting me. Accordingly, I have to
create onsets and schedule my
other work around this limiting
step. In short, if we determine what
is immovable and manipulate the
more yielding activities around it,


we can wont more etticiently.


A second production principle we
can apply to managerial work is
batching similar tasks. Anv
manufacturing operation requires a
certain amount of set-up time So
for managerial work to proceed
efficiently, we suouiu use the same
set-up effort to apply across a group


of similar activities. Think about
our continuous egg-boiler, which
was installed to produce finequality, identical, three-minute
eggs. Should we now decide to serve
our customers four-minute eggs, we
would have to slow down the


conveyor belt moving them through
the hot water. The adjustment takes
time: not only do we adjust nuts
and bolts on the machine, we also
have to inspect the quality of the
four-minute eggs by sampling a few
of them.


Set-up time has many parallels in
managerial work. For example, once
we have prepared a set of
illustrations for a training class, we
will obviously increase our
productivity if we can use the same
set over and over again with other
classes or groups. Similarly, if a
manager has a number of reports to
read or a number of performance


reviews to approve, he should set
aside a block of time and do a batch
of them together, one after the
other, to maximize the use of the
mental set-up time needed for the
task.


What makes running a factory
different from running a job shop?
The latter is prepared to service any
customer who drops in; the owner
handles the job required and moves
on to the next one. A factory, on the
other hand, is usually run by
forecast and not by individual order.
From my experience a large portion
of managerial work can be
forecasted. Accordingly, forecasting


those things you can and setting
yourself up to do them is only
common sense and an important
way to minimize the feeling and the
reality of fragmentation
experienced in managerial work.
Forecasting and planning your time
around key events are literally like
running an efficient factory.


What is the medium of a manager's
forecast? It is something very
simple: his calendar. Most people
use their calendars as a repository
of "orders" that come in. Someone
throws an order to a manager for
his time, and it automatically shows
up on his calendar* This is mind

less passivity. To gain better control
of his time, the manager should use
his calendar as a "production" planuing tooi, taking a firm initiative to
schedule work that isnot time
critical between those
"limitingsteps" in the

be applied here.

alfWay through and back up behind
a bottleneck. Instead, factory
managers *ay no at tne outset and
keep the start level from
overloading the system. Other kinds
of managers find uns nara to apply
because their indicators of'capacity
are not as well established or not as
believable. How much time do you
need to read your mail, to write
your reports, to meet with a
colleague? You mav not know
precisely but you surely have a feel
for the time required. And you
should exploit that sense to


schedule your work.


To use your calendar as a
production-planning tool, you must
accept responsibility for two things:


i. You should move toward the
active use of your calendar, taking
the initiative to fill the holes

between the time-critical events
with non-time-critical tnough
necessary activities.


2. You should say "no" at the outset
to work bevond your capacity to
handle.


It is important to say "no" earlier


rather than later

what amounts to


no. Remember too that your time is
your one finite


resource, and when you say "yes" to
one thing you are inevitably saying
"no" to another.


The next production principle you
can apply is to allow slack —a bit of
looseness in your scheduling.
Highway planners, for example,
know that a freeway can handle an
optimum number of vehicles*
Having fewer cars means that the
road is not being used at capacity.
But at that optimum point, if just a
few more cars are allowed to enter
the traffic flow, everything comes to
a crunching halt. With the new
metering devices that control access
during the rush hour, planners can


get a fix on the right number. The
same thing can be done for
managerial work. There is an
optimum degree of loading, with
enough slack built in so that one
unanticipated phone call will not
ruin your schedule for the rest of
the day. You need some slack.


Another production principle is very
nearly the opposite. A manager
should carry a raw material
inventory in terms of projects. This
is not to be confused with his workin-process inventory, because that,
like eggs in a continuous boiler,
tends to spoil or become obsolete
over time. Instead this inventory


should consist of things you need to
do but don't need to finish right
away— discretionary projects, the
kind the manager can work on to
increase his group's productivity
over the long term. Without such
an inventory of projects, a manager
will most probably use his free time
meddling in his subordinates 5
work.


A final principle. Most production
practices follow well-established
procedures and, rather than
reinventing the wheel repeatedly,
use a specific method that has been
shown to work before. But
managers tend to be inconsistent


and bring a welter of approaches to
the same task. We should work to
change that. As we become more
consistent, we should also
remember that the value of an
administrative procedure is
contained not in formal


d6 high output management


statementsbut in the real thinking
that led to its establishment. 1 his
means that even as we try to
standardize what we do, we should
continue to think critically about
wnat we do and the approaches we

use.


Built-in Leverage: How Many
Subordinates Should You Have . . .


An important component of
managerial leverage is the number
of subordinates a manager has. If
he does not have enough, his
leverage is obviously reduced. If he
has too many, he gets bogged down
—with the same result. As a rule of
thumb, a manager whose work is
largely supervisory should have six
to eight subordinates; three or four
are too few and ten are too many.
This range comes from a guideline
that a manager should allocate
auout a half day per week to each of
his subordinates. {1 wo days a week


per subordinate would probably
lead to meddling; an hour a week
does not provide enoueh
opportunity for monitoring.)


The six to eight rule is right for the
classically hierarchical manager
whose primary work is the
supervision of others. What about a
know-how manager, the middle
manager who mainly supplies
expertise and informations liven it
he works without a single
subordinate, servicing a number of
varied "customers" as an internal

consultant can in itself be a fulltime job. In fact, anyone who
spends about a half day per week as


a member of a planning, advisory,
or coordinating group has the
equivalent 01 a subordinate. So as a
rule of thumb, if a manager is both
a hierarchical supervisor and a
supplier of know-how, he should try
to have a total of six to e,Vht
subordinates or their equivalent.


Sometimes a businesses organized
in a way that makes u.e lueai tanout of six to eight subordinates hard
to reach. A manufacturing plant, for
example, may have an engineering
section and a production section, in
which

case the plant manager would only
have two people reporting directly
to him. The manager might then
choose to "acf ? as one of the two
subordinates, choosing to be his
own engineering manager, for
instance. If he does that, the
manufacturing manager will still
report to him, and he will have
added the people who would
ordinarily report to the head of
engineering. So the plant manager
will actually have six direct reports:
five engineers and the
manufacturing manager. The
arrangement, shown below, does


not have the engineers appearing to
be at the same organizational level
as the manufacturing manager —
something he would surely take
exception to.

This arrangement will avoid forcing
the plant manager either into onthe-job retirement or into
meddling.


Interruptions — The Plague of


Managerial V/ork


The next important production
concept we can apply to managerial
work is to strive toward regularity.
We could obviously run our
breakfast factory more efficiently if
customers arrived in a steady and
predictable stream


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


ramer man dropping in by ones and
twos. Though we can t control our
customers' habits, we should trv to
smooth out our workload as much
as possible. As noted, we sxiomd try
to make our managerial work take


on the characteristics of a factory,
not a job shop. Accordingly, we
snouia do everything we can to
prevent little stops and starts m our
day as well as interruptions brought
on uy uig emergencies. Even
though some of the latter are
unavoidable, we should always be
looking for sources of moire highpriority trouble by cutting windows
into the black box of our
organization. Recognizing vou've eot a time bomb on your hands
means you can address a problem
when you want to, not after the
bomb has o™<* nfF But because
you must coordinate your work


with that £ otxxer managers, you
can only move toward regularity if
others do too. In other words, the
same blocks of time must oe used
for like activities. For example, at
Intel Monday mornings have been
set aside throughout the
corporation as the time when
planning groups~meet. So anybody
who belongs to one can count on
Monday for that purpose and be
free of scheduling conflicts.


About twenty middle managers at
Intel were once asked to be part of
an experiment. After pairing up,
they tried some role-playing in
which one manager was to define


the problem most limiting his
output and the vuicr was to oe a
consultant who would analyze the
problem and propose solutions.


The most common problem cited
was uncontrolled interruptions,
which m remarkably uniform
fashion affected uocn supervisory
and know-how managers. Everyone
felt that the interruptions got in the
way of his "own" work interruptions
had a common source, most
frequently' 1°2 Frcm sub ordinates
and from people outside the
managers immediate organization
but whose work the managers
influenced. For those in


manufacturing, the interruptions
most often came from production

opera

tors, and for marketing people,
from outside customers: in short,
from the consumers of the middle
managers' authority and
information.


The most frequently proposed
solutions were not very practical.
The idea mentioned most often was

to create blocks of time for
individual work by hiding
physically. But this is a less than
happy answer, because the
interrupters obviously have


legitimate problems, and if the
manager responded by hiding, these
would pile up. One "solution" was a
suggestion that customers not call
marketing managers at certain
hours. No good.


There are better ways. Let's apply a
production concept. Manufacturers
turn out standard products. By
analogy, if you can pin down what
kind of interruptions you're getting,
you can prepare standard responses
for those that pop up most often.
Customers don't come up with
totally new questions and problems
day in and day out, and because the
same ones tend to surface


repeatedly, a manager can reduce
time spent handling interruptions
using standard responses. Having
them available also means that a
manager can delegate much of the
job to less experienced personnel.


Also, if you use the production
principle of batching — that is,
handling a group of similar chores
at one time— many interruptions
that come from your subordinates
can be accumulated and handled
not randomly, but at staff and at
one-on-one meetings, the subject of
the next chapter. If such meetings
are held regularly, people can't
protest too much if they're asked to


batch questions and problems for
scheduled times, instead of
interrupting you whenever they

want.


The use of indicators, especially the
bank of indicators kept over time,
can also reduce the time a manager
spends dealing with interruptions.
How fast he can answer a question
depends on how fast he can put his
finger on the information he needs
for a response. By


maintaining an archive of
information, a manager oocsn-t
nave to do ad hoc research every
time the phone nngs. r


If the people who interrupt you
knew how much they were
uisturomg you, they would probably
police them-selves more closely and
cut down on the number of mues
tney teit they had to talk to you
right away. In any case, a manager
should try to force his frequent
interrupters to make an active
decision about whether an issue can
wait. So, instead of going into
hiding, a manager can hang a sign
on his door that says, "I am doing
inuivunai work. Pl ease don't
interrupt me unless it really cant
wait until 2:00." Then hold an open
office nour, and be completely


receptive to anybody who wants to
see you. The key is this: understand
that interrupters have legitimate
problems that need to be han--*u•
*oat s why they're bringing them to
you. But you can channel the time
needed to deal with them into orgaxnzeu, scneduled form by
providing an alternative to
mterruption-a scheduled meeting
or an office hour.


ine point is to impose a pattern on
the way a manager copes with
problems. To make something
recn.W Lt was once irregular is a
fundamental productionprind-t«e,
anu tuat s now you should try to


handle the interruptions that
plague you.


Meetings—


The Medium


of Managerial W>rk


Meetings have a bad name. One
school of management thought
considers them the curse of the
manager's existence. Someone who
did a study found that managers
spend up to 50 percent of their time
in meetings, and implied that this
was time wasted. Peter Drucker
once said that spending more than


25 percent of his time in meetings
is a sign of a manager's
malorganization, and William H.
Whyte, Jr., in his book The
Organization Man, described
meetings as C€ non-contributory
labor* that managers must endure.


But there is another way to regard
meetings. Earlier we said that a big
part of a middle manager's work is
to supply information and knowhow, and to impart a sense of the
preferred method of handling
things to the groups under his
control and influence. A manager
also makes and helps to make
decisions. Both kinds of basic


managerial tasks can only occur
during face-to-face encounters, and
therefore only during meetings.
Thus I will assert again that a
meeting is nothing less than the
medium through which managerial
work is performed. That means we
should not be fighting their very
existence, but rather using the time
spent in them as efficiently as
possible.


The two basic managerial roles
produce two basic kinds of
meetings. In the first kind of
meeting, called a process-oriented
meeting, knowledge is shared and
information is exchanged. Such


meetings take place on a" regularly
scheduled basis. The purpose of the
second kind of meeting is to solve a
specific problem. Meetings of this
sort, called mission-oriented,
frequendy produce a decision. They
are ad hoc affairs, not scheduled
long in advance, because they
usually can't be.


Process-Oriented Meetings


To make the most of this kind of
meeting, we should aim to infuse it
with regularity. In other words, the
people attending should know how
the meeting is run, what kinds of
substantive matters are


discussed^d what is to be
accomplished. It should be designed
to allow a manager to "batch"
transactions, to use the same
"production" set-up time and effort
to take care of many similar
managerial tasks. Moreover, given
the regularity, you and the others
attending can begin to forecast the
time required for the kinds of work
to be done. Hence, a "production
control" system, as recorded on
various calendars, can take shape,
which means that a scheduled
meeting will have minimum impact
on other thins:s people are doing.


At Intel we use three kinds of


process-oriented meetings: the oneon-one, the staff meeting, and the
operation review.


ONE-ON-ONES


At Intel, a one-on-one is a meeting
between a supervisor and a
subordinate, and it is the principal
way their business relationship is
maintained. Its main purpose is
mutual teaching and exchange of
information. Bv talking about
specific problems and situations,
the supervisor


teaches the subordinate his skills
and know-how, and suggests ways


to approach things. At the same
time, the subordinate provides the
supervisor with detailed
information about what he is doing
and what he is concerned about.
From what I can tell, regularly
scheduled one-on-ones are highly
unusual outside of Intel. When I
ask a manager from another
company about the practice, I
usually get an "Oh no, I don't need
scheduled meetings with my
supervisor [or subordinate]; I see
him several times a day . . ." But
there is an enormous difference
between a casual encounter by a
supervisor and a subordinate, or


even a meeting (mission-oriented)
to resolve a specific problem, and a

one-on-one.


When Intel was a young company, I
realized that even though I was
expected to supervise both
engineering and manufacturing, I
knew very little about the
company's first product line,
memory devices. I also didn't know
much about manufacturing
techniques, my background having
been entirely in semiconductor
device research. So two of my
associates, both of whom reported
to me, agreed to give me private
lessons on memory design and


manufacturing. These took place by
appointment, and involved a
teacher/subordinate preparing for
each; during the session the
pupil/supervisor busily took notes,
trying to learn. x4s Intel grew, the
initial tone and spirit of such oneon-ones endured and grew.


Who should have a one-on-one? In
some situations a supervisor should
perhaps meet with all those who
work under him, from professionals
to production operators. But here I
want to talk about one-on-ones
between a supervisor and each of
the professionals who report to him
directly.


How often should you have
one=on-ones? Or put another way,
how do you decide how often
somebody needs such a meeting?
The answer is the job- or taskrelevant maturity of each of your
subordinates. In other


words, how much experience does a
given subordinate have with the
specific task at hand? This is not
the same as the experience he has
in general or how old he is. As we
will see later, the most effective
management style in a specific
instance varies from very close to
very loose supervision as a
subordinate's task maturity


increases. Accordingly, you should
have one-on-ones frequently (for
example, once a week) with a
subordinate who is inexperienced in
a specific situation and less
frequently (perhaps once every few
weeks) with an experienced

veteran.


Another consideration here is how
quickly things change in a job area.
In marketing, for example, the pace
may be so rapid that a supervisor
needs to have frequent one-on-ones
to keep current on what's
happening. But in a research
environment, life may be quieter,
and for a given level of task

relevant maturity, less frequent
meetings may suffice.


How long should a one-on-one
meeting last? There really is no
answer to this, but the subordinate
must feel that there is enough time
to broach and get into thorny
issues. Look at it this way. If you
had a big problem that you wanted
to kick around with your supervisor
—the person whose professional
interest in the matter is second only
to yours—would you want to bring
it up in a meeting scheduled to last
only fifteen minutes? You would
not. I feel that a one-on-one should

last an hour at a minimum.


Anything less, in my experience,
tends to make the subordinate
confine himself to simple things
that can be handled quickly.


Where should a one-on-one take
place? In the supervisor's office, in
the subordinate's office, or
somewhere else? I think you should
have the meeting in or near the
subordinate's work area if possible.
A supervisor can learn a lot simply
by going to his subordinate's office.
Is he organized or not? Does he
repeatedly have to spend time
looking for a document he wants?
Does he get inter

rupted all the time? Never? And in
general, how does the subordinate
approach his work?


A key point about a one-on-one: It
should be regarded as the
subordinate's meeting, with its
agenda and tone set by him. There's
good reason for this. Somebody
needs to prepare for the meeting.
The supervisor with eight
subordinates would have to prepare
eight times; the subordinate only
once. So the latter should be asked
to prepare an oudine, which is very
important because it forces him to
think through in advance all of the
issues and points he plans to raise.


Moreover, with an oudine, the
supervisor knows at the outset what
is to be covered and can therefore
help to set the pace of the meeting
according to the "meatiness" of the
items on the agenda. An outline
also provides a framework for
supporting information, which the
subordinate should prepare in
advance. The subordinate should
then walk the supervisor through
all the material.


What should be covered in a one
on-one? We can start with
performance figures, indicators
used by the subordinate, such as
incoming order rates, production


output, or project status. Emphasis
should be on indicators that signal
trouble. The meeting should also
cover anything important that has
happened since the last meeting:
current hiring problems, people
problems in general, organizational
problems and future plans, and—
very, very important— potential
problems. Even when a problem
isn't tangible, even if it's only an
intuition that something's wrong, a
subordinate owes it to his
supervisor to tell him, because it
triggers a look into the
organizational black box. The most
important criterion governing


matters to be talked about is that
they be issues that preoccupy and
nag the subordinate. These are
often obscure and take time to
surface, consider, and resolve.


What is the role of the supervisor in
a one-on-one? He should facilitate
the subordinate's expression of
what's going on and what's
bothering him. The supervisor is


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


there to learn and to coach. Peter
Drucker sums ud the supervisor's
job here very nicely: "The good time
users among managers do not talk


to their subordinates about their
problems but they know how to
make the subordinates talk about

theirs."


How is this done? By applying
Grove's Principle of Didactic
Management, "Ask one more
Question!" When th*> supervisor
thinks the subordinate has said all
he wants to auout a subject, he
should ask another question. He
should try to keep the flow of
thoughts coming by prompting the
subordinate with queries until both
feel satisfied that they have gotten
to the bottom of a problem. I d like
to suggest some mechanical hints


for effective one-on-one meetings.
First, both the supervisor and
subordinate snould have a copy of
the outline and both should take
notes on it, which serves a number
of purposes. I take notes in just
about all circumstances, and most
often end up never looking at them
again. I do it to Keep my mind from
drifting and also to help me digest
th^ information I hear and see.
Since I take note! in outline rorm, I
am forced to categorize the
information logically which helps
me to absorb it. Equally important
is wnat writing it down" symbolizes.
Many issues in a one-on-one lead to


action required on the part of the
suoorainate. When he takes a note
immediately following the
supervisor's suggestion, the act
implies a commitment, luce a
handshake, that something will be
done. The supervisor, also having
taken notes, can then follow up at

tne next one-on-one.


A real time-saver is using a "hold"
file where both the supervisor and
subordinate accumulate important
but not altogether urgent issues for
discussion at the next meeting. This
kind of file applies the production
principle of batching and saves time
for both involved by minimizing the


need for ad hoc contact-like phone
calls, drop-in visits, and so onwhich constitute the interrun-uons

we considered earlier.


The supervisor should also
encourage the discussion of heartto-heart issues during one-on-ones,
because this is the perfect forum for
getting at subtle and deep workrelated problems affecting his
subordinate. Is he satisfied with his
own performance? Does some
frustration or obstacle gnaw at
him? Does he have doubts about
where he is going? But the
supervisor should be wary of the
"zinger," which is a heart-to-heart


issue brought up at an awkward
time. More often than not, these
come near the end of a meeting. If
you let that happen, the
subordinate might tell you
something like he's unhappy and
has been looking outside for a job
and give you only five minutes to
deal with it.


Long-distance telephone one-onones have become necessary
because many organizations are
now spread out geographically. But
these can work well enough with
proper preparation and attention:
the supervisor must have the
outline before the meeting begins,


both parties should take notes, and
so on. Because you can't see the
other participant in the meeting,
note-taking can't work in the same
way as in a face-to-face meeting.
Exchanging notes after the meeting
is a way to make sure each knows
what the other committed himself

to do.


One-on-ones should be scheduled
on a rolling basis— setting up the
next one as the meeting taking
place ends. Other commitments can
thereby be taken into account and
cancellations avoided. If the
supervisor uses a set schedule for a
one-on-one, such as every second


Wednesday morning, and if the
subordinate's vacation happens to
fall on that date, the meeting is not
going to occur. By scheduling on a
rolling basis, this can be easily
avoided.


What is the leverage of the one-onone? Let's say you have a one-onone with your subordinate every
two weeks, and it lasts one and a
half hours. Ninety minutes of your
time can enhance the quality of
your subordinate's work for two
weeks, or for some eighty-plus
hours,


and also upgrade your


understanding of what he's doing.
Clearly, one-on-ones can exert
enormous leverage. This happens
through the development of a
common base of information and
similar ways of doing and handling
things between the supervisor and
the subordinate. And this, as noted,
is the only way in which efficient
and effective delegation can take
place.


At the same time, the subordinate
teaches the supervisor, and what is
learned is absolutely essential if the
supervisor is to make good
decisions. During a recent one-onone meeting, my subordinate, who


is responsible for Intel's sales
organization, reviewed trend
indicators of incoming orders.
While I was vaguely familiar with
them, he laid out a lot of specific
information and convinced me that
our business had stopped growing.
Even though the summer is
typically slow, he proved to me that
what was going on was not just
seasonal. After we pondered the
data for a while and considered
their relationship to other
indicators of business activity in
our industry, we came to the
reluctant conclusion that business
was in fact slowing down. This


meant we should take a
conservative approach to near-term
investment-no small matter.


By sharing his base of information
with me, the two of us developed a
congruent attitude, approach, and
conclusion: conservatism in our
expansion plans. He left the
meeting having decided to scale
back growth in his own area of
responsibility. I left having decided
to share what we had concluded
with the business groups I
supervised. Thus, this one-on-one
produced substantial leverage: the
Intel sales manager affected all the
other managers who reported to


me.


To digress a bit, I also think that
one-on-ones at home can help
family life. As the father of two
teenage daughters, I have found
that the conversation in such a time
together is very different in tone
and kind from what we


say to each other in other
circumstances. The one-on-one

makes each of us take the other
seriously and allows subtle and
complicated matters to come up for
discussion. Obviously, no notes are
taken, as father and daughter
usually go out for dinner at a


restaurant, but a family one-on-one
very much resembles a business
one-on-one. I strongly recommend
both practices.


STAFF MEETINGS


A staff meeting is one in which a
supervisor and all of his
subordinates participate, and which
therefore presents an opportunity
for interaction among peers. As we
will see later, peer interaction—
especially decision-making by a
group of peers—is not easy. Yet it is
key to good management. The
approach to decision-making that
we advocate in the next chapter, as


well as the workings of the principle
of dual reporting (Chapter 9),
depend on a group of peers working
well together. By learning how this
happens in staff meetings, where a
group of peers get to know each
other, and where the presence of a
common supervisor helps peer
interaction to develop, managers
will be prepared to be members of
other working bodies based on peer

groups.


Staff meetings also create
opportunities for the supervisor to
learn from the exchange and
confrontation that often develops.
In my own case, I get a much better


understanding of an issue with
which I am not familiar by listening
to two people with opposing views
discuss it than I do by listening to
one side only.


My first experience with staff
meetings dates back to my early
professional years when I was the
head of a small group of engineers
doing semiconductor device
research. Everyone in this group
worked on an isolated aspect of a
problem or on a different problem
altogether. I was supposed to be the
supervisor, but I found that

subordinates bearing the brunt of
working the issues. Staff meetings
are an ideal medium for decisionmaking, because the group of
managers present has typically
worked together for a long time*
The formal as well as informal
authority of each individual has
been well established, and
everybody knows who likes to spout
off, who tends to daydream, who
knows what stuff and so on, A staff
meeting is like the dinner-table
conversation of a family, while


other forums of interaction at work,
involving people who don't know
each other very well, are like a
group of strangers having to make a
decision together.


OPERATION REVIEWS


This is the medium of interaction
for people who don't otherwise have
much opportunity to deal with one
another. The format here should
include formal presenta

tions in which managers describe
their work to other managers who
are not their immediate
supervisors, and to peers in other


parts of the company. The
basic'pur-pose of an operation
review at Intel is to keep the
teaching and learning going on
between employees several
organizationaljevels apart—people
who don't have one-on-ones or start
meetings with each other. This is
important for both the junior and
senior manager. The junior person
will benefit from the comments,
criticisms, and suggestions of the
senior manager, who in turn will
get a dilterent feel for problems
from people familiar with their
details. Such meetings are also a
source of motivation: managers


making the presentations will want
to leave a good impression on their
supervisor's supervisor and on their
outside peers.


Who are the players at an operation
review? The organizing manager,
the reviewing manager, the
presenters, and the audience. Each
of these players has a distinct role
to play if the review is to be a useful

one.


The supervisor of the presenting
managers—an Intel divisional
marketing manager, let's say—
should organize the meeting. He
should help the presenters decfde


what issues should be talked about
and what should not, what should
be emphasized, and what level of
detail to go into. The supervisor
should also be in charge of
housekeeping (the meeting room,
visual materials, invitations, and so
on). Finally, he should be the
timekeeDer. scheduling the
presentations and keeping them
moving along. Though it's hard to
judge in advance the time needed
for any discussion, the supervisor
has presuma-uiy had more
experience running meetings. In
any case, he should pace the
presenters using inconspicuous


gestures, so that the manager
talking: doesn't sudd^nlv finH
himself out of time with only half
his points covered.


The reviewing manager is the
senior supervisor at whom the
review is aimed—like the general
manager of an Intel division. He
has a very important although more


Meetings $$


subtle role to play: he should ask
questions, make comments, and in
general impart the appropriate
spirit to the meeting. He is the
catalyst needed to provoke audience


participation, and by his example he
should encourage free expression.
He should never preview the
material, since that will keep him
from reacting spontaneously.
Because the senior supervisor is a
role model for the junior managers
present, he should take his role at
the reviev/ extremely seriously.


The people presenting the reviews—
a group of marketing supervisors,
for example—should use visual aids
such as overhead transparencies to
the extent possible. People are
endowed with eyes as well as ears,
and the simultaneous use of both
definitely helps the audience


understand the points being made.
But care must be taken, because all
too frequently a presenter gets so
obsessed with getting through all of
his visual material that his message
gets lost even while all his charts
get flipped. As a rale of thumb, I
would recommend four minutes of
presentation and discussion time
per visual aid, which can include
tables, numbers, or graphics. The
presenter must highlight whatever
he wants to emphasize with a color
pen or pointer. Throughout, a
presenter has to watch his audience
like a hawk. Facial expressions and
body language, among other things,


will tell him if people are getting
the message, if he needs to stop and
go over something again, or if he is
boring them and should speed up.


The audience at an operation review
also has a crucial part to play. One
of the distinguishing marks of a
good meeting is that the audience
participates by asking questions and
making comments. If you avoid the
presenter's eyes, yawn, or read the
newspaper it's worse than not being
there at all. Lack of interest

undermines the confidence of the
presenter. Remember that you are
spending a big part of your working
day at the review. Make that time as


valuable for yourself and your
organization as


you can. Pay attention and jot down
things you've heard that you might
try. Ask questions if something is
not clear to you and speak up if you
can't go along with an approach
being recommended. And if a
presenter makes a factual error, it is
your responsibility to go on record.
Remember, you are being paid to
attend the meeting, which is not
meant to be a siesta in the midst of
an otherwise busy day. Regard
attendance at the meeting for what
it is: work.


Mission-Oriented Meetings


Unlike a process-oriented meeting,
which is a regularly scheduled affair
held to exchange knowledge and
information, the mission-oriented
meeting is usually held ad hoc and
is designed to produce a specific
output, fre-quendy a decision. The
key to success here is what the
chairman does. Very often no one is
officially given that title, but by
whatever name, one person usually
has more at stake in the outcome of
the meeting than others. In fact, it
is usually the chairman or the de
facto chairman who calls the
meeting, and most of what he


contributes should occur before it
begins. All too often he shows up as
if he were just another attendee and
hopes that things will develop as he
wants. When a mission-oriented
meeting fails to accomplish the
purpose for which it was called, the
blame belongs to the chairman.


Thus the chairman must have a
clear understanding of the
meeting's objective—what needs to
happen and what decision has to be
made. The absolute truth is that if
you don't know what you want, you
won't get it. So before calling a
meeting, ask yourself: What am I
trying to accomplish? Then ask, is a


meeting necessary? Or desirable?
Or justifiable? Don't call a meeting
if all the answers aren't yes.


An estimate of the dollar cost of a
manager's time,


including overhead, is about $100
per hour. So a meeting involving
ten managers for two hours costs
the company $2,000* Most
expenditures of $2,000 have to be
approved in advance by senior
people—like buying a copying
machine or making a transatlantic
trip—yet a manager can call a
meeting and commit $2,000 worth
of managerial resources at a whim.


So even if you're just an invited
participant, you should ask yourself
if the meeting—and your
attendance—is desirable and
justified. Tell the chairman—the
person who invited you—if you do
not feel it is. Determine the purpose
of a meeting before committing
your time and your company's
resources. Get it called off early, at
a low-value-added stage, if a
meeting makes no sense, and find a
less costly way (a one-on-one
meeting, a telephone call, a note) to
pursue the matter.


Assuming the meeting does need to
be held, the chairman faces a set of


obligations. The first one has to do
with attendance. As the chairman,
you must identify who should
attend and then try to get those
people to come. It is not enough to
ask people and hope for the best;
you need to follow up and get
commitments. If someone invited
can't make it himself, see to it that
he sends a person with the power to
speak for him.


Keep in mind that a meeting called
to make a specific decision is hard
to keep moving if more than six or
seven people attend. Eight people
should be the absolute cutoff.
Decision-making is not a spectator


sport, because onlookers get in the
way of what needs to be done.


The chairman is also responsible
for maintaining discipline. It is
criminal for him to allow people to
be late and waste everyone's time.
Remember, wasting time here
really means that you are wasting
the company's money, with the
meter ticking away at the rate of
$100 per hour per person. Do not
worry about confronting


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


the late arriver. Just as you would
not permit a fellow employee to


steal a piece of office equipment
worth $2,000, you shouldn't let
anyone walk away with the time of
his fellow managers.


The chairman should finally be
responsible for logistical matters.
He should, for example, make sure
that all necessary and audiovisual
equipment is present in the
meeting room. He should also send
out an agenda that clearly states the
purpose of the meeting, as well as
what role everybody there is
expected to play to get the desired
output. An example of such an
agenda is shown below.

This may sound like too much
regimentation for you, but whether
it's that or needed discipline
depends on your point of view* If
the chairman forces you to show up
at a meeting prepared and on time,
you might consider him a drill
sergeant. But if you show up on
time, ready to work, and someone
else doesn't and isn't, you'll
probably begrudge the person
responsible for wasting your time.


It must be much the same in an
operating room. Some people
working there may not like a
surgeon insisting upon precision,
but I am one patient who would
much prefer a disciplined operating
room to any other kind.


Once the meeting is over, the
chairman must nail down exactly
what happened by sending out
minutes that summarize the
discussion that occurred, the
decision made, and the actions to be
taken. And it's very-important that
attendees get the minutes quickly,
before they forget what happened.
The minutes should also be as clear


and as specific as possible, telling
the reader what is to be done, who
is to do it, and when. All this may
seem like too much trouble, but if
the meeting was worth calling in
the first place, the v/ork needed to
produce the minutes is a small
additional investment (an activity
with high leverage) to ensure that
the full benefit is obtained from

what was done.


Ideally, a manager should never
have to call an ad hoc, missionoriented meeting, because if all
runs smoothly, everything is taken
care of in regularly scheduled,
process-oriented meetings. In


practice, however, if all goes well,
routine meetings will take care of
maybe 80 percent of the problems
and issues; the remaining 20
percent will still have to be dealt
with in mission-oriented meetings.
Remember, Peter Drucker said that
if people spend more than 25
percent of their time in meetings, it
is a sign of malorganization. I
would put it another way: the real
sign of malorganization is when
people spend more than 25 percent
of their time in ad hoc missionoriented meetings.

Decisions, Decisions


Making decisions—or more
properly, participating in the
process by which they are made—is
an important and essential part of
every manager's work from one day
to the next. Decisions range from
the profound to the trivial, from the
complex to the very simple: Should
we buy a building or should we
lease it? Issue debt or equity?
Should we hire this person or that
one? Should we give someone a 7
percent or a 12 percent raise? Can
we deposit a phosphosilicate glass
with 9 percent phosphorus content
without jeopardizing its stability in


a plastic package? Can we appeal
this case on the basis of Regulation
939 of the Internal Revenue Code?
Should we serve free drinks at our
departmental Christmas party?


In traditional industries, where the
management chain of command
was precisely defined, a person
making a certain kind of decision
was a person occupying a particular
position in the organization chart.
As the saying went, authority (to
make decisions) went with
responsibility (position in the
management hierarchy). However,
in businesses that mostly deal with
information and know-how, a


manager has to cope with a new
phenomenon. Here a rapid
divergence develops between power
based on position and power based
on knowledge, which


occurs because the base of
knowledge that constitutes the
foundation of the business changes
rapidly.


What do I mean? When someone
graduates from college with a
technical education, at that time
and for the next several years, that
young person will be fully up-todate in the technology of the time.
Hence, he possesses a good deal of


knowledge-based power in the
organization that hired him. If he
does well, he will be promoted to
higher and higher positions, and as
the years pass, his position power
will grow but his intimate
familiarity with current technology
will fade. Put another way, even if
today's veteran manager was once
an outstanding engineer, he is not
now the technical expert he was
when he joined the company. At
Intel, anyway, we managers get a
little more obsolete every day.


So a business like ours has to
employ a decision-making process
unlike those used in more

conventional industries. If Intel
used people holding old-fashioned
position power to make all its
decisions, decisions would be made
by people unfamiliar with the
technology of the day. And in
general, the faster the change in the
know-how on which the business
depends or the faster the change in
customer preferences, the greater
the divergence between knowledge
and position power is likely to be. If
your business depends on what it
knows to survive and prosper, what


decision-making mechanism should
you use? The key to success is again
the middle manager, who not only
is a link in the chain of command

but also can see to it that the
holders of the two types of power
mesh smoothly.


Ideal Model


Illustrated on page 90 is an ideal
model of decisionmaking in a
know-how business. The first stage
should be free discussion, in which
all points of view and all aspects of
an issue are openly welcomed and
debated. The


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


IF WRONG


The ideal decision-making process.


greater the disagreement and
controversy, the more important
becomes the word free. This sounds
obvious, but it's not often the
practice. Usually when a meeting
gets heated, participants hang back,
trying to sense the direction of
things, saying nothing until they
see what view is likely to prevail.
They then throw their support
behind that view to avoid being
associated with a losing position,
bizarre as it may seem, some
organizations actually encourage
such behavior. Let me quote from a
news account relating to the woes
of a certain American automobile


company: "In the meeting in which
I was informed that Iwas released, I
was told, 'Bill, in general, people
who do well in this company wait
until they hear their superiors
express their view and then
contribute something in support of
that view/ " This is a terrible way to
manage. All it produces is bad
decisions, because if


Decisions, Decisions gi


knowledgeable people withhold
opinions, whatever is decided will
be based on information and insight
less complete than it could have
been otherwise.


The next stage is reaching a clear
decision. Again, the greater the
disagreement about the issue, the
more important becomes the word
clear. In fact, particular pains
should be taken to frame the terms
of the decision with utter clarity.
Again, our tendency is to do just the
opposite: when we know a decision
is controversial we want to obscure
matters to avoid an argument. But
the argument is not avoided by our
being mealy-mouthed, merely
postponed. People who don't like a
decision will be a lot madder if they
don't get a prompt and straight
story about it.


Finally, everyone involved must
give the decision reached by the
group full support. This does not
necessarily mean agreement: so
long as the participants commit to
back the decision, that is a
satisfactory outcome. Many people
have trouble supporting a decision
with which they do not agree, but
that they need to do so is simply
inevitable. Even when we all have

the same facts and we all have the
interests of an organization in
mind, we tend to have honest,
strongly felt, real differences of
opinion. No matter how much time
we may spend trying to forge


agreement, we just won't be able to
get it on many issues. But an
organization does not live by its
members agreeing with one another
at all times about everything. It
lives instead by people committing
to support the decisions and the
moves of the business. All a
manager can expect is that the
commitment to support is honestly
present, and this is something he
can and must get from everyone.


The ideal decision-making model
seems an easy one to follow. Yet I
have found that it comes easily to
only two classes of professional
employees—senior managers who


have been in the company for a long
time, who feel at home with the
way things are done, and who
identify


with the values of the organization;
and the new graduates that we hire,
because they used the model as
students doing college work. This is
the way a team of students working
on a laboratory experiment will
resolve its differences, so for the
young engineer the Intel model is a
continuation of what he was used
to. But for middle managers, the
decision-making model is easier to
accept intellectually than it is to
practice. Why? Because they often


have trouble expressing their views
forcefully, a hard time making
unpleasant or difficult decisions,
and an even harder time with the
idea that they are expected to
support a decision with which they
don't agree. It may take a while, but
the logic of the ideal scheme will
eventually win everyone over.


Another desirable and important
feature of the model is that any
decision be worked out and reached
at the lowest competent level. The
reason is that this is where it will be
made by people who are closest to
the situation and know the most
about it. And by "know" I don't just


mean "understand technically."
That kind of expertise must be
tempered with judgment, which is
developed through experience and
learning from the many errors one
has made in one's career. Thus,
ideally, decision-making should
occur in the middle ground,
between reliance on technical
knowledge on the one hand, and on
the bruises one has received from
having tried to implement and
apply such knowledge on the other.
To make a decision, if you can't find
people with both qualities, you
should aim to get the best possible
mix of participants available. For


experience, we at Intel are likely to
ask a person in management senior
to the other members of the group
to come to the meeting. But it is
very important that everybody there
voice opinions and beliefs as equals
throughout the free discussion
stage, forgetting or ignoring status
differentials.


A journalist puzzled by our
management style once asked me,
"Mr. Grove, isn't your company's
emphasis on


Decisions, Decisions ga


visible signs of egalitarianism such


as informal dress, partitions instead
of offices, and the absence of other
obvious perks like reserved parking
spaces, just so much affectation?"
My answer was that this is not
affectation but a matter of survival.

In our business we have to mix
knowledge-power people with
position-power people daily, and
together they make decisions that
could affect us for years to come. If
we don't link our engineers with
our managers in such a way as to
get good decisions, we can't succeed
in our industry. Now, status
symbols most certainly do not
promote the flow of ideas, facts, and


points of view. What appears to be a
matter of style really is a matter of
necessity.


The Peer-Group Syndrome


The model is also hard to
implement because anybody who
makes a business decision also
possesses emotions such as pride,
ambition, fear, and insecurity.
These tend to come to the surface
quickly when people who are not
used to working with one another
are asked to make a decision. This

means we need to think about what
keeps decision-making from
happening smoothly along the lines


we've advocated.


The most common problem is
something we call the peer-group
syndrome. A number of years ago,
at Intel's very first management
training session, we tried some
role-playing to show people what
can occur when a group of peers
meets to solve a problem or make a
decision. We sat the people around
a table to tackle what was then a
live issue for them in their real jobs.
Everyone was an organizational
equal. The chairman of the meeting
was one level higher, but was
purposely sent out of the room so
he couldn't hear what was to


happen. Observers in the audience
couldn't believe their eyes and ears
as the mock meeting proceeded.
The managers working on the
problem did nothing but go around
in circles for some fifteen


minutes, and none of them noticed
they weren't getting anywhere.
When the chairman was brought
back in, he sat down and listened
for a while and couldn't believe
things either. We watched him lean
forward as if he were trying to glean
more from the conversation. We

then saw a black cloud form over
his head; finally he slapped the
table and exclaimed, "What's going


on here? You people are talking in
circles and getting nowhere." After
the chairman intervened, the
problem was resolved in very short
order. We named this the peer-plusone approach, and have used it
since then to aid decision-making
where we must. Peers tend to look
for a more senior manager, even if
he is not the most competent or
knowledgeable person involved, to
take over and shape a meeting.


Why? Because most people are
afraid to stick their necks out. This
is how John, an Intel software
engineer, sees things:


One of the reasons why people are
reluctant to come out with an
opinion in the presence of their
peers is the fear of going against the
group by stating an opinion that is
different from that of the group.
Consequently, the group as a whole
wanders around for a while, feeling
each other out, waiting for a
consensus to develop before anyone
risks taking a position. If and when
a group consensus emerges, one of
the members will state it as a group
opinion ("I think our position
seems to be .. ."), not as a personal
position. After a weak statement of
the group position, if the rest of the


mob buys in, the position becomes
more solid and is restated more
forcefully.


Note the difference between the
situation described earlier by the
auto executive and the one John
describes. In the former instance,
the people were expected to wait for
their supervisor to state his opinion
first. In the latter, members of the
group were waiting for a consensus

to


develop. The dynamics are
different, but the bottom line in
both is that people didn't really
speak their minds freely. That


certainly makes it harder for a
manager to make the right
decisions.


You can overcome the peer-group
syndrome if each of the members
has self-confidence, which stems in
part from being familiar with the
issue under consideration and from
experience. But in the end selfconfidence mostly comes from a
gut-level realization that nobody
has ever died from making a wrong
business decision, or taking
inappropriate action, or being
overruled. And everyone in your
operation should be made to
understand this.


If the peer-group syndrome
manifests itself, and the meeting
has no formal chairman, the person
who has the most at stake should
take charge. If that doesn't work,
one can always ask the senior
person present to assume control.
He is likely to be no more expert in
the issues at hand than other
members of the group—perhaps
less expert—but he is likely to act as
a godfather, a repository of
knowledge about how decisions
should be made, and give the group
the confidence needed to make a

decision.


One thing that paralyzes both


knowledge and position power
possessors is the fear of simply
sounding dumb. For the senior
person, this is likely to keep him
from asking the questions he
should ask. The same fear will
make other participants merely
think their thoughts privately
rather than articulate them for all
to hear; at best they will whisper
what they have to say to a neighbor.
As a manager, you should remind
yourself that each time an insight
or fact is withheld and an
appropriate question is suppressed,
the decision-making process is less
good than it might have been.


A related phenomenon influences
lower-level people present in the
meeting. This group has to
overcome the


q6 high output management


fear of being overruled, which
might mean embarrassment: if the
rest of the group or a senior-level
manager vetoed a junior person or
opposed a position he was
advocating, the junior manager
might lose face in front of his peers.
This, even more than fear of
sanctions or even of the loss of job,
makes junior people hang back and
let the more senior people set the


likely direction of decision-making.


But some issues are so complex
that those called on to make a
decision honestly aren't really sure
how they feel When knowledge and
position power are separated, the
sense of uncertainty can become
especially acute, because the
knowledge people are often not
comfortable with the purely
business-related factors that might
influence a decision. What is often
heard is, "We don't know what the
company [or division or
department] wants of us." Similarly,
managers holding position power
don't know what to do because they


realize they don't know enough
about the technical details to arrive

at the correct decision. We must
strive not to be done in by such
obstacles. We are all human beings
endowed with intelligence and
blessed with willpower. Both can be
drawn upon to help us overcome
our fear of sounding dumb or of
being overruled, and lead us to
initiate discussion and come out

front with a stand.


Striving for the Output


Sometimes no amount of
discussion will produce a
consensus, yet the time for a


decision has clearly arrived. When
this happens, the senior person (or
"peer-plus-one") who until now has
guided, coached, and prodded the
group along has no choice but to
make a decision himself. If the
decision-making process has
proceeded correctly up to this point,
the senior manager will be making
the decision having had the full
benefit of free discussion wherein
all points of view, facts, opinions,
and


judgments were aired without
position-power prejudice. In other
words, it is legitimate—in fact,
sometimes unavoidable^—for the


senior person to wield positionpower authority if the clear decision
stage is reached and no consensus
has developed. It is not legitimate—
in fact, it is destructive—for him to
wield that authority any earlier.
This is often not easy. We
Americans tend to be reluctant to
exercise position power deliberately
and explicitly—it is just "not nice"
to give orders. Such reluctance on
the part of the senior manager can
prolong the first phase of the
decision-making process—the time
of free discussion—past the
optimum point, and the decision
will be put off.


If you either enter the decisionmaking stage too early or wait too
long, you won't derive the full
benefit of open discussion. The
criterion to follow is this: don't
push for a decision prematurely.
Make sure you have heard and
considered the real issues rather
than the superficial comments that
often dominate the early part of a
meeting. But if you feel that you
have already heard everything, that
all sides of the issue have been
raised, it is time to push for a
consensus—and failing that, to step
in and make a decision. Sometimes
free discussion goes on in an


unending search for consensus.
But, if that happens, people can
drift away from the near consensus
when they are close to being right,
diminishing the chances of reaching
the correct decision. So moving on
to make the decision at the right
time is crucial.


Basically, like other things
managers do, decisionmaking has
an output associated with it, which
in this case is the decision itself.
Like other managerial processes,
decision-making is likelier to
generate high-quality output in a
timely fashion if we say clearly at
the outset that we expect exacdy


that. In other words, one of the
manager's key tasks is to setde six
important questions in advance:


- What decision needs to be made?


- When does it have to be made?


- Who will decide?


- Who will need to be consulted
prior to making the decision?


- Who will ratify or veto the
decision?


- Who will need to be informed of

the decision?


Let me illustrate how these six
questions came into play in a recent
decision I was involved in. Intel had
already decided to expand its
Philippine manufacturing plant,
roughly doubling its capacity. The
next question was where. Only
limited space was available next to
the existing plant. But, other things
being equal, building there was the
most desirable thing to do because
overhead and communications
could be shared, transportation
costs between the two plants would
amount to virtually nothing, and
our employees could be transferred
from one plant to the other very


easily. The alternative consisted of
buying a less expensive plot of land
quite some distance away. The land
would be not only cheaper but more
plentiful, which would allow us to
build a relatively inexpensive oneor two-story building. Buying the
lot near the existing plant meant
that we would have had to build a
high-rise to get the amount of floor
space we needed, and a high-rise
semiconductor manufacturing plant
would not be the most efficient.

That made us hesitate. But it would
be nice to have a second building
next to the one we already own.
Back and forth and so on and so


forth went the discussion.


Let's apply our six questions here. It
is clear what decision needed to be
made: we either build a multistory
building next to our existing plant,
or we build a one- or two-story
building at a new outlying location.
As for the question when: according
to our long-range plans, we needed
the new plant in two to two and a
half years; if


Decisions, Decisions go


we apply time offsets, we must
make the decision within a month.

This answers the when.


Who will decide? Our
facilities/construction people or the
Intel group that manages the
manufacturing plants? The answer
is not easy. The first organization is
more sensitive to matters
pertaining to the costs and
difficulties of construction, and will
probably lean toward the new
location. The plant management
group, knowing that operational
benefits will come from having the
two plants side by side, will
probably opt for the high-rise. So
the decision-making body is
composed of our construction
manager for our Far East locations;


his supervisor, the construction
manager for the corporation; the
manager of the Far East
manufacturing plant network; and
his supervisor, the senior
manufacturing manager. The
meeting gave us parallel levels of
managers from the two
organizations. The sensitivities of
two interest groups coming to bear
on a single decision is quite
common in real corporate life. In
such meetings, it is important to
give to the two sides roughly equal
representation, because only from
such balance will an even-handed
decision emerge. All of these


individuals have consulted their
staffs prior to the decision and
gathered all relevant knowledge and
views on the subject.


Who will ratify or veto the
decision? The first common person
to whom the senior managers of
both organizations report is myself.
Also, this was a big enough deal
that the president of the company
should be involved. Moreover, I was
somewhat familiar with the
locations in the Philippines and
how a plant like the one we have
there operates. So I was chosen as
the person to veto or ratify the
decision of the meeting.


Who will need to be informed of

this decision? I chose Gordon
Moore, our chairman of the board.
He's not directly involved with
manufacturing plants like the one
contemplated, but we don't build a
new one in the Far


East every day, so he should know
about what happened. This is how
the decision was made. After
studying maps, construction plans
and costs, land costs, and traffic
patterns, and considering several
times evervthimr we thought was
important, the group decided to'
build next to our existing plant but
to accept only as much


manufacturing area as four stories
would yield. The cost would have
escalated had we exceeded that.
This, with all relevant background,
was presented to me at the meeting
described on the agenda shown in
the previous chapter. I listened to
the presentation of the alternatives
tne group considered and to the
reasons why they preferred thenchoice to these, and after asking a
series of questions and probing
both the group's information and its
UxinKing process, I ratified the
decision. Subsenu^ntlv I informed
Gordon Moore of the outcome, and
as you are reading this, the plant is


either under construction or already
operating.


Employing consistent ways by
which decisions are to be made has
value beyond simply expediting the
decision-making itself. People
invest a great deaf of energy and
emotion m coming up with a
decision. Then somebody who has
an important say-so or the right to
veto it may come across the
decision later. If he does veto it he
can be regarded as a Johnny-comelately who upsets'the uecisionmaking applecart. This, of course,
will frustrate and demoralize the
people who may have been working


on it ror a long time. If the veto
comes as a surprise" however
legitimate it may have been on its
merits, an impression of political
maneuvering is inevitably created.
Politics and manipulation or even
their aooear-ance should be avoided

at all costs. And I can think of no
better way to make the decisionmakinr nro^« straightforward than
to apply before the fart
the°structure imposed by our six
questions.


One last thing. If the final word has
to be dramatically Cerent irom the
expectations of the people who par

ticipated in the decision-making
process (had I chosen, for example,
to cancel the Philippine plant
project altogether), make your
announcement but don't just walk
away from the issue. People need
time to adjust, rationalize, and in
general put their heads back
together. Adjourn, reconvene the
meeting after people have had a
chance to recover, and solicit their
views of the decision at that time.
This will help everybody accept and
learn to live with the unexpected.


If good decision-making appears
complicated, that's because it is and
has been for a long time. Let me


quote from Alfred Sloan, who spent
a lifetime preoccupied with
decision-making: "Group decisions
do not always come easily. There is
a strong temptation for the leading
officers to make decisions

themselves without the sometimes
onerous process of discussion."
Because the process is indeed
onerous, people sometimes try to
run away from it. A middle manager
I once knew came straight from one
of the better business schools and
possessed what we might call a
'John Wayne" mentality. Having
become frustrated with the way
Intel made decisions, he quit. He


joined a company where his
employers assured him during the
interview that people were
encouraged to make individual
decisions which they were then free
to implement. Four months later,
he came back to Intel. He explained
that if he could make decisions
without consulting anybody, so
could everybody else.

Planning: Today's Actions for
Tomorrow's Output


The Planning Process


Most people think "planning" is one
of the loftier responsibilities of
management-we all learned
somewhere that "a manager plans,
organizes, controls." Tn tact,
planning is an ordinary everyday
activity; it's something au or us do
all the time with no fanfare, in both
our personal and professional lives.
For instance, as you're anvmg to
work m the morning, you are likely
to decide whether or not you need
gasoline. You look at the gauge to
see how much gas you have in the
tank, you estimate uOW iar lt ls y°
u ne ed to go, and you then make a
rough guess as to how much gas


you need to get to and from your
omce. By comparing in your mind
the gas you need with the gas you
have, you decide whether vou
should stop tor gas or not. This is a
simple example of planning. *«e
uyxiamics of planning can best be
understood by going back to our
basic production principles. As we
learned m Chapter 2, the key
method of controlling the future
output of a factory is through the
use of a svstem 01 rorecasting
demand and building to forecast.
We operated our factory to fill
existing and anticipated oroVr,


Our job was to match the factory's


output at a given time with the
orders for it. If the projected output
did not match the projected market
demand, either we made additional
production starts or we reduced
them to eliminate the excess. How
one plans at the factory can then be
summarized as follows: step 1,
determine the market demand for
product; step 2, establish what the
factory will produce if no
adjustment is made; and step 3,
reconcile the projected factory
output with the projected market
demand by adjusting the production
schedule.


Your general planning process


should consist of analogous
thinking. Step 1 is to establish
projected need or demand: What
will the environment demand from
you, your business, or your
organization? Step 2 is to establish
your present status: What are you
producing now? What will you be
producing as your projects in the
pipeline are completed? Put
another way, where will your
business be if you do nothing
different from what you are now
doing? Step 3 is to compare and
reconcile steps 1 and 2. Namely,
what more (or less) do you need to
do to produce what your


environment will demand?


Let's consider each step in more
detail.


STEP 1—ENVIRONMENTAL

DEMAND


Just what is your environment? If
you look at your own group within
an organization as if it were a standalone company, you see that your
environment is made up of other
such groups that directly influence
what you do. For example, if you
were the manager of the company's
mailroom, your environment would
consist of customers who need your


services (the rest of the company),
vendors who are able to provide you
with certain capabilities (postage
meters, mail carts), and finally,
your competitors. You don't, of
course, have competitors internally
— but you can compare your service
to one like United


Pa f^ as ? way to J ud S e
performance and set standards.


What should you look for when you
examine your environment? You
should attempt to determine your
customers* expectations and their
perception of your performance.
You should keep abreast of


technological developments like
electronic mail and other
alternative ways of doing your job.
You should evaluate the
performance of your vendors. You
should also evaluate the
performance of other groups in the
organization to which you belong.
Does some other group (like the
traffic department) affect how well
you can do your work? Can that
group meet your needs?


Once you have established what
constitutes your environment, you
need to examine it in two time
frames— now, and sometime in the
future, let's say in a year. The


questions then become: What do
my customers want from me now?
Am I satisfying them? What will
they expect from me one year from
now? You need to focus on the
difference between what your
environment demands from you
now and what you expect it to
demand from you a year from now.
Such a difference analysis is crucial,
because if your current activities
satisfy the current demands placed
on your business, anything more
and new should be undertaken to
match this difference. How you
react to this difference is in fact the
key outcome of the planning


process.


Should you at this stage consider
what practical steps you can
actually take to handle matters? No,
that will just confuse the issue.
What would happen to a factory, for
instance, if the marketing
organization adjusted its demand
forecast on the basis of its own
assessment of the manufacturing
unit's ability to deliver? If
marketing knew they could sell 100
widgets per month but thought that
manufacturing could only deliver
ten, and so submitted a demand
forecast of ten units, manufacturing
would never tool up to satisfy the


real demand.


STEP 2—PRESENT STATUS


The second step of planning is to
determine your present status. You
do this by listing your present
capabilities and the projects you
have in the works. As you account
for them, be sure to use the same
terms, or "currency," in which you
stated demand. For instance, if your
demand is listed in terms of
completed product designs, your
work-in-process should be listed as
partially completed product designs.
You also need to look at timing;
namely, when will these projects


come out of your "pipeline"? You
must ask yourself, will every project
now moving through be completed?
Chances are, no, some will get
scrapped or aborted, and you have
to factor this into your forecasted
output. Statistically, in
semiconductor manufacturing, only
some 80 percent of the material
started actually gets finished.
Similarly, while it is impossible to
be precise in every case, it is
prudent to factor in some
percentage of loss for managerial
projects as well.


STEP 3—WHAT TO DO TO CLOSE
THE GAP


The final step of planning consists
of undertaking new tasks or
modifying old ones to close the gap
between your environmental
demand and what your present
activities will yield. The first
question is, What do you need to do
to close the gap? The second is,
What can you do to close the gap?
Consider each question separately,
and then decide what you actually
will do, evaluating what effect your
actions will have on narrowing the
gap, and when. The set of actions
you decide upon is your strategy.


Much confusion exists between
what is strategy and what is tactics.


Although the distinction is rarely of
practical significance, here's one
that might be useful. As you
formulate in words what you plan
to do, the most abstract and general
summary of those actions


meaningful to you is your strategy.
What you'll do to implement the
strategy is your tactics. Frequently,
a strategy at one managerial level is
the tactical concern of the next
higher level. Let's return to our
mailroom. Assume that the
manager of corporate
communications has decided to

install electronic mail service
between all manufacturing plants.


This is his strategy—a plan of action
to improve communications
capability between plants. The
mailroom manager then has to do
certain things to provide service
when electronic mail equipment is
put in place. For instance, his
strategy may be to install printers in
the mailroom and set up a service
to deliver printed copies throughout
the building. The mailroom
manager's strategy is the
communications manager's tactics.


SOME EXAMPLES


As he defined his present
environment and status, Bruce, an


Intel marketing manager, found
that he had only three people in his
department who could possibly
handle a huge inventory of projects.
As he looked at his desired future
status, he concluded that every
single one of the projects had to be
completed. Not finishing everything
would result in significant extra
cost and far more ettort later. Bruce
was faced with a genuine dilemma,
especially since the budget kept him
from hiring more people. He
realized that the best he could do
was to narrow the gap a bit—getting
the projects and his group's capacity
to complete them to converge. A


complete match was impossible.


Bruce decided to move as many
noncritical tasks as possible to
other groups in the company-—
groups less qualified for them than
his own but also less busy. He also
made arrangements with his
manager to bring a summer student
on board to help with some easily
definable tasks, and then set
himself up to monitor the per

formance of his group tightly. He
also proceeded to look at other
avenues that could help him in the
longer term, such as splitting the
job of completing some of the work


with other similar marketing
groups in the company and
eliminating any duplication of
effort between them. Finally Bruce
initiated a request to increase the
size of his organization. His plan—
and the obvious reality that full
convergence between his tasks and
his capabilities was not possible
even after going the extra mile—
would lay the basis for his request.


Let's illustrate with another
example. Our middle manager
Cindy, the manufacturing process
engineer whom we've met before, is
responsible for maintaining and
improving the process by which


complex microchips are produced in
a plant. She defines her
environment as a collection of
"objects" and "influences." The
"objects" are new processes and
manufacturing tools that have not
yet been tested in production. The
"influences" are the people who can
affect her work directly or
indirectly. Development engineers,
for example, would like her to
require less experimentation and
documentation before she chooses
to implement new processes they
have developed. Meanwhile,
production engineers would like her
to provide more experimentation


and documentation on these same
new processes. And finally, there
are the product engineers eager to
get chips out the door who need her
help to do that, along with other
members of the production team
who put pressure on her to ensure
that the new processes are
manufacturable and the new
manufacturing tools work as soon
as they are put to use. Cindy herself
works like a consultant, advising
each group influencing her about
whether something can go into
production—the chief coordinator
for the set of events required to put
a product, a process, or a tool on


stream. Her "customer" is the
production area itself, and her
"vendors" are the engineering
groups from production,
development, and product
engineering.


!


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


108


Analyzing her present status, Cindy
found that the data and
experimentation she needed from
the development group always
came in incomplete. Looking into


matters further, she found that
providing complete data and
adhering to schedules were not
really high on the development
engineers' set of priorities.
Determining where she needed to
go, it was clear to Cindy that she
must have all future new processes
and production machinery tested,
debugged, demonstrated, and, most
important, accompanied by the
necessary data for them to be
accepted and used by the
production engineers, who had
become more demanding because
of past problems.


Cindy then defined her strategy—


her plan of action— to get there.
She specified exactly what steps had
to be completed before any new
process was to be implemented or
tool deployed. Then she used time
offsets (remember the breakfast
factory) to determine when each
step needed to be done in order for
her entire plan to be completed on
time. Next, she got the manager of
the development engineers to agree
to her detailed sc^me. She
negotiated with him what she had
to dn and what they had to do-and
by what date—in order to meet what
became the mutually agreed-upon
goals. Finally, to ensure that she


stayed on track, she decided to
monitor all of her "vendors" on a
weekly basis. She wouia aiso

the schedule to motivate them to

recognizing today's gap try very


hard


to determine what decision has to

represents a failure of planning
sometime in the past. By analogy,
forcing ourselves to concentrate on
the decisions needed to fix today's
problem is like scurrying after our
car has already run out of gas.
Clearly we should have filled up
earlier. To avoid such a fate,
remember that as you plan you
must answer the question: What do
I have to do today to solve—or
better, avoid— tomorrow's
problem?


Thus, the true output of the
planning process is the set of tasks
it causes to be implemented. The
output of Intel's annual plan, for
instance, is the actions taken and
changes prompted as a result of the
thinking process that took place
throughout the organization. I, for
one, hardly ever look at the bound
volume finally called the Annual
Plan. In other words, the output of
the planning process is the
decisions made and the actions
taken as a result of the process.


How far ahead should the planners
look? At Intel, we put ourselves
through an annual strategic long

range planning effort in which we
examine our future five years off.
But what is really being influenced
here? It is the next y ear — an d
only the next year. We will have
another chance to replan the second
of the five years in the next year's
long-range planning meeting, when
that year will become the first year
of the five. So, keep in mind that
you implement only that portion of
a plan that lies within the time
window between now and the next
time you go through the exercise.
Everything else you can look at
again. We should also be careful not
to plan too frequently, allowing


ourselves time to judge the impact
of the decisions we made and to

determine whether our decisions
were on the right track or not. In
other words, we need the feedback
that will be indispensable to our
planning the next time around.


Who should be involved in the
planning process? The operating
management of the organization.
Why? Be

cause the idea that planners can be
people apart from uiose
implementing the plan simply does
not work. Plan-mng cannot be made
a separate career but is instead a


~ey managerial activity, one with
enormous leverage through its
impact on the future performance
of an organization. But this leverage
can only be realized through a
marriage, and a good collaborative
one at that, between planning and
implementation


Finally remember that by saying

2. How will I pace myself to see if I
am getting there? (The answer gives
us milestones, or key results. )


To illustrate an objective and a key
result, consider the following: I
want to go to the airport to catch a
plane in an hour. That is my
objective. I know that I must drive
through towns A, B, and C on my
way there. My key results become
reaching A, B, and C in 10, 20, and
30 minutes respectively. If I have
been driving for 20 minutes and
haven't yet made town A, I know
I'm lost. Unless I get off the
highway and ask someone for
directions, I probably won't make


my flight.


Upon what time period should an
MBO system focus? MBO is largely
designed to provide feedback
relevant to the specific task at hand;
it should tell us how we are doing
so we can make adjustments in
whatever we are doing if need be,
such as getting off the highway and
asking for directions. For the
feedback to be effective, it must be
received very soon after the activity
it is measuring occurs. Accordingly,
an MBO system should set
objectives for a relatively short
period. For example, if we plan on a
yearly basis, the corresponding


MBO system's time frame should
be at least as often as quarterly or
perhaps even monthly.


The one thing an MBO system
should provide par excellence is
focus. This can only happen if we
keep the number of objectives
small. In practice, this is rare, and
here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to
our inability to say "no"—in this
case, to too many objectives. We
must realize—and act on the
realization—that if we try to focus
on everything, we focus on nothing.
A few extremely well-chosen
objectives impart a clear message
about what we say "yes" to and


what we say "no" to— which is what
we must have if an MBO system is
to work.


TWO CASE HISTORIES


To familiarize ourselves with the
MBO system, let's look at a case
history, Columbus' discovery of the
New World though how I tell the
story takes considerable liberties
wun me grammar-school version of
the event. Thanks to its annual
planning process of 1491, the
government of Spain concluded that
it could not continue a war everybody felt was utterly necessary
unless money became available to


buy weapons and ammunition.
Since pushing me Moors out of
Spain was the supreme goal of
Queen Isabella's government, the
Queen needed the uuias to ao it.
Isabella decided she would get
money by dramatically improving
Spain's foreign trade balance, one
men talked to her subordinateChristopher Co-lumbus-and told
him about her objective. Columbus
agreed to thmk about various ways
to do what she wanted and after a

time Went back to her with ^v^l
suggestions, which included finding
pirate-free passage to x.ng.anu and
perhaps finding a new route to the


Ori-ent.Isabella and Columbus
discussed the entire matter .reeiy
eventually reaching a clear decision
that he would look tor a new route

to the East.


Once the decision was made,
Columbus began to think of all the
things that he would need to do to
accomDlish nis intent In MBO
terms, the Queen defined her^ovm
objective (increase Spain's wealth);
Columbus and rtw> Queen men
agreed upon his objective (find a
new route to the Orient). Columbus
then went on to formulate the key
results by which he would pace
himself, which in-c.u.eu outaimng


several ships, training crews,
conducting^ shakedown cruise,
setting sail, and so forth, with eacu
possessing a specific deadline.


The relationship between Isabella's
and Columbus' oujectives is dear.
The Queen wanted to increase her
nation s wealth, while Columbus
wanted to find a safe traae route to
the Orient. And we see a nesting
hierarchy


of objectives: if the subordinate's
objectives are met, the supervisor's
will be as welL


Now, the key results can come in


like clockwork, but the objectives
can still be missed. For Columbus,
the key results were relatively easy
to achieve, but he most certainly did
not find a new trade route to China,
and therefore failed to meet his
objective.


Did Columbus perform well even
though he failed by strict MBO
terms? He did discover the New
World, and that was a source of
incalculable wealth for Spain. So it
is entirely possible for a
subordinate to perform well and be
rated well even though he missed
his specified objective. The MBO
system is meant to pace a person—


to put a stopwatch in his own hand
so he can gauge his own
performance. It is not a legal
document upon which to base a
performance review, but should be
just one input used to determine
how well an individual is doing. If
the supervisor mechanically relies
on the MBO system to evaluate his
subordinate's performance, or if the
subordinate uses it rigidly and
forgoes taking advantage of an
emerging opportunity because it
was not a specified objective or key
result, then both are behaving in a
petty and unprofessional fashion.


Let's illustrate the workings of the


MBO system using the decision
about Intel's plant expansion in the
Philippines. The Far East
construction manager had an
objective that read "Obtain decision
on Philippine plant expansion/' The
key results supporting the objective
were: 1) Do a study of land
availability near the present plant
and at other acceptable locations by
June. 2) Do financial analyses
showing the trade-offs between
land costs and construction costs,
as well as the operating costs
associated with the two locations.
3) Present the results to the plant
location steering group, and obtain


a decision from them. 4) Have
Grove ratify the decision by Octo=
ber.


Each key result was accomplished
and the objective


was met. Note that the objective is
relatively short-range and the key
results are so specific that a person
knows without question whether he
has completed them and done it on
time or not. Accordingly, to be
useful a key result must contain
very specific wording and dates, so
that when deadline time arrives,
there is no room for ambiguity.


As you might have guessed, the Far
East construction manager's
supervisor had an objective that
read "Ensure that all plant
expansion projects stay on
schedule." To support this objective
he in turn had a key result, much
like his subordinate's objective, that
said "Obtain Philippine plant
expansion decision by October."


You can now see, I hope, the
parallels between how Isabella's
government and Intel work. A
manager's objectives are supported
by an appropriate set of key results.
His objectives in turn are tied to his
supervisor's objectives so that if the


manager meets his objectives, his
supervisor will meet his. But the
MBO system cannot be run
mechanically by a computer. The
system requires judgment and
common sense to set the hierarchy
of objectives and the key results
that support them. Both judgment
and common sense are also
required when using MBO to guide
you in your work from one day to
the next.


Part Three


TEAM


OF TEAMS


The


Breakfast Factory


Goes National


We left the breakfast factory as it
was enjoying great success—so
great, in fact, that we had to install
a continuous egg-boiling unit at
considerable expense. The
equipment produced breakfasts of
unprecedented uniformity.
Moreover, our volume grew to the
point where we could use the eggboiling unit at full capacity: hence,
our cost of delivering outstanding
breakfasts steadily declined. We


passed on some of the savings to
our customers, and soon the
reputation of our breakfasts spread.


Like good entrepreneurs, we knew
we had a good thing going and
started another branch of the
Breakfast Factory across town (we
even named it that). This too
became a remarkable success. Soon
thereafter Neighborhood Gourmet,
a magazine with a large national
circulation, ran a story on our
operation. We decided to seize the
opportunity and franchise the
Breakfast Factory nationwide. We
rapidly moved into neighborhoods
with the right demographic mix for


our breakfasts, and we were soon
enough running a vast network of
Breakfast Factories.


Before long we found, however, that
the network required a set of tasks
and skills very different from those
needed to run our one restaurant.
The most important


of these was to figure out how to
use the advantages made possible
by having a local entrepreneur set
up and run each franchise without
losing the enormous economies of
scale that became available to us.
Because the local manager knows
his neighborhood, he can adapt his


operation to it and so, we hope,
operate the most profitable
franchise possible. At the same
time, with over a hundred Breakfast
Factories, our purchasing power is
immense. If we centralize certain
activities, we are in a position to do
many things much better and much
less expensively than each of our
franchises could do individually.
And most important, because the
quality of our breakfasts has played
a major role in our success so far,
we have to be very concerned about
maintaining a perception of firstrate food and service. In other
words, we could not permit any one


Breakfast Factory branch or those
in any region to jeopardize the real
secret of our business.


In fact, the centralizationdecentralization dichotomy is so
pervasive that it has become one of
the most important themes in the
management of our network. Do
we, for instance, want to advertise
locally or nationally? Do we want to
give the local manager the control
over advertising in his community?
We don't know who reads the Daily
Bktt, and he probably does. Do we
want to give him the right to hire
and fire personnel? Should we let
him set his wage scale, or do we


want to impose one nationally? The
latter hardly makes sense, since
labor market conditions vary
considerably from region to region.
But we do want to buy our
sophisticated automatic machinery
centrally. After all, it has taken us a
long time to develop suitable
vendors and the capacity to test the
incoming machines given our
demanding requirements. We now
have a sizable group of people doing
only that in Chicago, and we hardly
want each branch or even each
region to duplicate the effort.


But I don't think we should buy all
our eggs in Chi

cago. We want them to be fresh,
and we don't want to truck this
delicate commodity all over the
country. Neither do we want to have
each branch set up its own
incoming egg inspection operation.
Here some kind of compromise
makes sense, such as regional egg
purchasing centers, with each only
a few hours by truck from all the
franchise locations in the region.
We do want uniform, high-quality
standards everywhere and we will
monitor each of the franchises to
make sure that they are adhered to.
In other words, we definitely want
to impose national quality control


standards.


What about items on the menu? By
and large we want to keep the same
core menu everywhere—people
going into the Breakfast Factory
should be able to count on some

basic choices. But we should also
recognize regional differences in
culinary taste, so some discretion
ought to be left to the individual
franchises.


What about real estate? Should we

allow our Breakfast Factories to be
housed in any locally available
building? Or should we prescribe a
uniform construction style and


build each of them from the ground
up? Perhaps we should go with
whatever building is available
provided it meets some standards
we set in Chicago.


What about furniture? Does it have
to be utterly uniform? Should
Chicago buy furniture for all
branches? What about tableware?
Since people tend to associate what
they eat with and from with the
breakfast, we should probably use
the same tableware all over the
country, which means we might as
well purchase all that at one place
too. But it is ridiculous for a local
operation in Montana to requisition


Chicago for a few broken plates. So
we should probably have a couple of
regional warehouses from which
tableware could be delivered
quickly.


How do we choose the location of

new franchises within each
metropolitan area? Should we make
the decisions in Chicago? Should I
decide as the CEO of the Breakfast
Factory Corporation or should the
corporate


staff let the local branch manager
decide? Or perhaps Chicago should
decide after consulting with the
regional managers, who, after all,


know their own areas better than
my staff and I do.


Things have become very
complicated. Sometimes as I sit
behind my big desk at corporate
headquarters, I wish I could go back
to the early days when I was getting
the eggs and toast and pouring the
coffee myself. Or if not that, at least
back to the days when I was
running a single Breakfast Factory,
and I knew everybody by name and
could make all the decisions
without having to struggle with a
mountain of pros and cons. Then
"there was virtually no overhead.
Now there's a corporate personnel


manager. There's also a traffic
manager, who wants to buy a
computer to optimize the flow of
eggs from the regional centers to
the individual franchises. He says
he can minimize transportation
costs while ensuring same-day
delivery. He also claims that if he
had this computer, he could keep
the tableware inventory at the
lowest possible level. It won't be
long before we'll have a corporate
manager for real estate
acquisitions. Very complicated
indeed.


Earlier, we established the fact that
the game of management is a team


game: a manager's output is the
output of the organizations under
his supervision or influence. We
now discover that management is
not just a team game, it is a game in
which we have to fashion a team of
teams, where the various individual
teams exist in some suitable and
mutually supportive relationship
with each other.

Hybrid Organizations


What happened to the Breakfast
Factory has to happen, or has
already happened, to every


reasonably large organization.


Most middle managers run
departments that are a part of a
larger organization. The "black
boxes'' they oversee are connected
to other black boxes in much the
same way that the Breakfast
Factories are linked to each other

and to the main office. So let us
look more carefully at what
happens within an organization
composed of smaller units.


Though most are mixed,
organizations can come in two
extreme forms: in totally missionoriented form or in totally


functional form. The Breakfast
Factory Corporation could be
organized in one or the other
extreme form, as shown on the next
page. In the mission-oriented
organization (a), which is
completely decentralized, each
individual business unit pursues
what it does—its mission—with
little tie-in to other units. Here,
each Breakfast Factory is
responsible for all elements of its
operation: determining its own
location and constructing its own
building, doing its own
merchandising, acquiring and
maintaining its own personnel, and


doing its own purchasing. In the
end it submits monthly financial

ments to the corporate executive
office.


At the other extreme is the totally
functional organization (b), which
is completely centralized. In a
Breakfast Factory Corporation set
up this way, the merchandising
department is responsible for


merchandising at all loca~ tions;
the staff of the personnel
organization hires, fires, and
evaluates personnel at all branches;
and so on.


The desire to give the individual
branch manager the power to
respond to local conditions moves
us toward a mission-oriented
organization. But a similarly
legitimate desire to take advantage
of the obvious economies of scale
and to increase the leverage of the
expertise we have in each
operational area across the entire
corporation would push us toward a
functional organization. In the real


world, of course, we look for a
compromise between the two
extremes. In fact, the search for the
appropriate compromise has
preoccupied managers for a long,
long time. Alfred Sloan summed up
decades of experience at General
Motors by saying, "Good
management rests on a
reconciliation of centralization and
decentralization." Or, we might say,
on a balancing act to get the best
combination of responsiveness and
leverage.


Let's now look at Inters
organization form, as shown on the
next page. We are a hybrid


organization. Our hybrid nature
comes from the fact that the form
of the overall corporate
organization results from a mix of
the business divisions, which are
mission-oriented, and the
functional groups. This is much like
the way I imagine any army is
organized. The business divisions
are analogous to individual fighting
units, which are provided with
blankets, paychecks, aerial
surveillance, intelligence, and so
forth by the functional
organizations, which supply such
services to all fighting units.
Because each such unit does not


have to maintain its own support
groups, it can concentrate on a
specific mission, like taking a hill in
a batde. And for that, each unit has
all the necessary freedom of action
and independence.


The functional groups can be
viewed as if they were internal
subcontractors. Let's take a sales
organization as an example. Though
a lot of companies use outside sales
representatives, an internal group
presumably provides the service at
less expense and with greater
responsiveness. Likewise,
manufacturing- finance, or data
processing can all be regarded as


functional groups, which, as

Intel is a hybrid organization:

combination of responsiveness and
leverage.


internal subcontractors, provide
services to all the business units.


Some two thirds of Intel's
employees work in the functional
units, indicating their enormous
importance. What are some of the
advantages of organizing so much
of the company in such groups? The
first is the economies of scale that

can be achieved. Take the case of
computerized information
processing. Complex com

puter equipment is very expensive,
and the capacity of large electronic
machines can be best used if all the

various business units draw from

them. If each unit had its own
computer, very expensive
equipment would be sitting idle
much of the time. Another
important advantage is that
resources can be shifted and
reallocated to respond to changes in
corporate-wide priorities. For
instance, because manufacturing is
organized functionally, we can
change the mix of product being
made to match need as perceived by
the entire corporation. If each


business unit did its own
manufacturing, shifting capacity
away from one unit to another
would be a cumbersome and sticky
exercise. And the advantage here is
that the expertise of specialists—
know-how managers, such as the
research engineers v/ho work in
technology development—can be
applied across the breadth of the
entire corporation, giving their
knowledge and work enormous
leverage. Finally, Inters functional
groups allow the business units to
concentrate on mastering their
specific trades rather than having to
worry about computers, production,


technology, and so forth.


Having so much of Intel organized
in functional units also has its
disadvantages. The most important
is the information overload hitting
a functional group w T hen it must
respond to the demands made on it
by diverse and numerous business
units. Even conveying needs and
demands often becomes very
difficult—a business unit has to go
through a number of management
layers to influence decision-making
in a functional group. Nowhere is
this more evident than in the
negotiations that go on to secure a
portion of centralized—and limited


—resources of the corporation, be it
production capacity, computer time,
or space in a shared building.
Indeed, things often move beyond
negotiation to intense and open
competition among business units
for the resources controlled by the
functional groups. The bottom line
here is that both the negotiation
and competition waste time and


energy because neither contributes
to the output or the general good of
the company.


What are some of the advantages of
organizing much of a company in a
mission-oriented form? There is


only one. It is that the individual
units can stay in touch with the
needs of their business or product
areas and initiate changes rapidly
when those needs change. That is it
All other considerations favor the
functional-type of organization. But
the business of any business is to
respond to the demands and needs
of its environment, and the need to
be responsive is so important that it
always leads to much of any
organization being grouped in
mission-oriented units.


Countless managers have tried to
find the best mix of the two
organizational forms. And it's been


no different at Intel, among senior
management and throughout the
ranks of hundreds of middle
managers, who from time to time
attempt to improve the organization
of the groups they supervise. But no
matter how many times we have
examined possible organizational
forms, we have always concluded
that there is simply no alternative
to the hybrid organizational

structure.


So that is how Intel is organized
today. To further my case that
hybrid organizations are inevitable,
consider a press release that I read
recently. One of dozens that show


up in the weekly trade newspapers,
it is reproduced here with only the
names changed.


ABC TECHNOLOGIES REALIGNS


(santa clara, ca) Three-year-old
ABC>$echnologies, Inc., has
reorganized into three product
divisions. The Super System
Division Vice President and General
Manager is John Doe, formerly Vice
President and Engineering Direc-'
tor and a company founder. Vice
President and General Manager of
the Ultra System Division is former
Sales and Marketing Vice President
William Smith. Vice President and


General Manager of the Hyper
System Division is Robert Worker,
formerly Manager of Product
Design.


All three division heads report to
ABC Technologies President and
Chief Executive Samuel Simon. The
divisions will have product
marketing and product
development responsibilities, while
sales and manufacturing
responsibilities will remain at the
corporate level under newly named
Sales Vice President Albert Abel and
Manufacturing Vice President
William Weary.


Note how the change follows the
pattern we outlined and analyzed.
As the company grew and its
product line broadened, the number
of things it had to keep track of
multiplied. It made more and more
sense to create an organization
serving each product line; hence the
three product divisions. But as the
news release indicates, the major
functional organizations of ABC
Technologies, such as sales and
manufacturing, will remain
centralized and will serve the three
mission-oriented organizations.


Here I would like to propose
Grove's Law: All large organizations


with a common business purpose
end up in a hybrid organizational
form.


The Breakfast Factory, an army,
Intel, and ABC Technologies
provide examples. But just about
ebery large company or enterprise
that I know is organized in a hybrid
form. Take an educational

institution in which one finds

individual mission-oriented
departments such as mathematics,
English, engineering, and so on, and
also administration, composed of
personnel, security, and library
services, whose combined task is to
supply the common resources that


each of the individual departments
needs to function.


Another very different example of
the hybrid form can be found in the
national Junior Achievement
organization. Here each individual
chapter runs its own business, with
each deciding what product to sell,
actually selling


it, and otherwise maintaining all
aspects of the business.
Nevertheless, the national
organization controls the way the
chapters are to go about their own
pursuits: the form in which the
individual businesses are to be


structured, the paperwork
requirements, and the rewards for
successful operation.


The use of the hybrid organizational
form does not even necessarily
depend on how large a business or
activity is. A friend of mine is a
lawyer in a medium-size law firm.
He told me how his firm tried to
deal with the problems and
conflicts he and his colleagues were
having over resources they all
shared, such as the steno pool and
office space. They ended up forming
an executive committee that would
not interfere with the legal
(mission-oriented) work of the


individual attorneys but would
address the acquisition and
allocation of common, shared
resources. Here is a small operation
finding itself with the hybrid
organizational form.


Do any exceptions exist to the
universality of hybrid
organizations? The only exceptions
that come to my mind are
conglomerates, which are typically
organized in a totally missionoriented form. Why are they an
exception to our rule? Because they
do not have a common business
purpose. The various divisions (or
companies) in this case are all


independent and bear no
relationship to one another beyond
the conglomerate profit and loss
statement. But within each
business unit of the conglomerate,
the organization is likely to be
structured along the hybrid line.


Of course, each hybrid organization
is unique because a limitless
number of points lie between the
hypothetical extremes of the totally
functional and the totally missionoriented forms. In fact, a single
organization may very well shift
back and forth between the two
poles, movement that should be
brought on by pragmatic


considerations. For example, a
company with an inadequate
computer acquires a large, powerful
new one, making


possible centralized economies of
scale. Conversely, a company
replaces a large computer with
small inexpensive ones that can be
readily installed in various missionoriented units without loss of the
economies of scale. This is how 7 a
business can adapt. But the most
important consideration should be
this: the shift back and forth
between the two types of
organizations can and should be
initiated to match the operational


styles and aptitudes of the
managers ninning the individual
units.


As I've said, sooner or later all
reasonably large companies must
cope with the problems inherent in
the workings of a hybrid
organization. The most important
task before such an organization is
the optimum and timely allocation
of its resources and the efficient
resolution of conflicts arising over
that allocation.


Though this problem may be very
complex, "allocators'' working out
of some central office are certainly


not the answer. In fact, the most
glaring example of inefficiency Fve
encountered went on some years
ago in Hun-gar/, where I once lived
and where a central planning
organization decided what goods
were to be produced, when, and
where. The rationale for such
planning v/as very solid, but in
practice it usually fell far, far short
of meeting real consumer needs. In
Hungary I was an amateur
photographer. During the winter,
when I needed high-contrast film,
none was to be found anywhere. Yet
during the summer, everyone was
up to his waist in the stuff, even


though regular film was in short
supply. Year after year, decisionmaking in the central planning
organization was so clumsy that it
could not even respond to totally
predictable changes in demand. In
our business culture, the allocation
of shared resources and the
reconciliation of the conflicting
needs and desires of the
independent business units are
theoretically the function of
corporate management. Practically,
however, the transaction load is far
too heavy to be handled in one
place. If we at Intel tried to resolve
all conflicts and allocate all


resources at the top, we would
begin to resemble the group that
ran the Hungarian economy.


Instead, the answer lies with middle
managers. Within a company, they
are, in the first place, numerous
enough to cover the entire range of
operation; and, in the second place,
very close to the problem we're
talking about— namely, generating
internal resources and consuming
those resources. For middle
managers to succeed at this highleverage task, two things are
necessary. First, they must accept
the inevitability of the hybrid
organizational form if they are to


serve its workings. Second, they
must develop and master the
practice through which a hybrid
organization can be managed. This
is dual reporting, the subject of our
next chapter.

To put a man on the moon, NASA
asked several major contractors and
many subcontractors to work
together, each on a different aspect
of the project. An unintended


consequence of the moon shot was
the development of a new
organizational approach: matrix
management This provided the
means through which the work of
various contractors could be
coordinated and managed so that if
problems developed in one place,
they did not subvert the entire
schedule. Resources could be
diverted, for example, from a strong
organization to one that was
slipping in order to help the latter
make up lost time. Matrix

outside any of the contractors
involved, could wield as much
influence on the work of units
within a given company as could
the company management itself.
Thus, NASA elaborated the
principle of dual reporting on a
grand scale. In reality, the basic idea
had been quietly at work for many
years, enabling hybrid organizations
of all types to function, from the
neighborhood high school to Alfred
Sloan's General Motors—not to
mention the Breakfast Factory


franchises. Let's re-create how Intel


came to adopt a dual reporting
system.


Where Should Plant Security
Report?


When our company was young and
small, we stumbled onto dual
reporting almost by accident. At a
staff meeting we were trying to
decide to whom the security
personnel at our new outlying
plants should report. We had two
choices. One would have the
employees report to the plant
manager. But a plant manager, by
background, is typically an engineer
or a manufacturing person who


knows very little about security
issues and cares even less. The

other choice would have them
report to the security manager at
the main plant. He hired them in
the first place, and he isjhe expert
who sets the standards that the
security officers are supposed to
adhere to throughout the company.
And it was clear that security
procedures and practices at the
outlying plants had to conform to
some kind of corporate standard.


I here was only one problem with
the latter arrangement. The security
manager works at corporate
headquarters and not at the


outlying plant, so how would he
know if the security personnel
outside the main plant even showed
up, or came in late, or
otherwise'per-rormed badly? He
wouldn't. After we wrestled with the
dilemma for a while, it occurred to
us that perhaps security personnel
should report jointly to the
corporate security manager and to
the local plant manager. The hrst
would specify how the job ought to
be done, and the second would
monitor how it was being
performed day by day.


While the arrangement seemed to
solve both problems, the staff


couldn't quite accept it. We found
ourselves asking, "A person has to
have a boss, so who is in charge
here?" Could an employee in fact
have two bosses? ine answer was a
tentative "yes," and the cul

tore of joint reporting relationships,
dual reporting, was born. It was a
slow, laborious birth.


But the need for dual reporting is
actually quite fundamental. Let's
think for a minute about how a
manager comes to be. The first step
in his career is being an individual
contributor—a salesman, for
instance. If he proves himself a


superior salesman, he is promoted
to the position of sales manager,
where he supervises people in his
functional specialty, sales. When he
has shown himself to be a superstar
sales manager he is promoted
again, this time becoming a regional
sales manager. If he works at Intel,
he is now not only supervising
salesmen but also so-called field
application engineers, who
obviously know more about
technical matters than he does but
whom he still manages. The
promotions continue until our
superstar finds himself a general
manager of a business division

Among other things, our new
general manager has no experience
with manufacturing. So while he is
perfectly capable of supervising his
manufacturing manager in the
more general aspects of his job, the
new boss has no choice but to leave
the technical aspects to his
subordinate, because as a graduate
of sales, he has absolutely no
background in manufacturing. In
other divisions of the corporation,
manufacturing managers may
similarly be reporting to people who
rose through the ranks of
engineering and finance.


We could handle the problem by


designating one person the senior
manufacturing manager and having
all the manufacturing managers
report to him instead of to the
general manager. But the more we
do this, the more we move toward a
totally functional form of
organization. A general manager
could no longer coordinate the
activities of the finance, marketing,
engineering, and manufacturing
groups toward a single business
purpose responsive to marketplace
needs. We want the immediacy and
the operating priorities coming
from the general man

ager as well as a technical


supervisory relationship. The
solution is dual reporting.


But does the technical supervisor's
role have to be filled by a single
individual? No. Consider the
following scenario, which could be
taken from an ordinary day at Intel.
Our manufacturing manager is
sitting in the cafeteria having a cup
of coffee, and the manufacturing
manager from another division
(whose boss, the general manager,
has a finance background) comes
over. They start chatting about
what's going on in their respective
divisions and begin to realize that
they have a number of technical


problems in common. Applying the
theory that two heads are better
than one, they decide to meet a bit
more often. Eventually the
meetings become regularly
scheduled and manufacturing
managers from other divisions join
the two to exchange views about
problems they share. Pretty soon a
committee or a council made up of
a group of peers comes into
existence to tackle issues common
to all. In short, they have found a
way to deal with those technical
issues that their bosses, the general
managers, can't help them with. In
effect, they now have supervision


that a general manager competent
in manufacturing could have given
them, but that supervision is being
exercised by a peer group. The
manufacturing managers report to
two supervisors: to this group and
to their respective general
managers, as the figure opposite
shows.


To make such a body work requires
the voluntary surrender of
individual decision-making to the
group. Being a member means you
no longer have compfete freedom of
individual action, because you must
go along with the decisions of your
peers in most instances. By analogy,


think of yourself as one of a couple
who decides to take a vacation with
another couple. You know that if
you go together you will not be free
to do exacdy what you want to do
when you want to do it, but you go
together anyway because you'll
have more fun, even while you'll
have less

freedom. At work, surrendering
individual decisionmaking depends
on trusting the soundness of
actions taken by your group of

peers.


Trust in no way relates to an
organizational principle but is
instead an aspect of the corporate
culture, something about which
much has been written in recent
years. Put simply, it is a set of
values and beliefs, as well as
familiarity with the way things are


done and should be done in a
company. The point is that a strong
and positive corporate culture is
absolutely essential if dual
reporting and decision-making by
peers are to work.


This system makes a manager's life
ambiguous, and most people don't
like ambiguity. Nevertheless, the
system is needed to make hybrid
organizations work, and while
people will strive to find something
simpler, the reality is that it doesn't
exist. A strictly functional
organization, which is clear
conceptually, tends to remove
engineering and manufacturing (or


the equivalent groups in your firm)
from the marketplace, leaving them
with no idea of what the customers
want. A highly mission-oriented
organization, in turn, may have
definite crisp re

porting relationships and clear and
unambiguous objectives at all
times. However, the fragmented
state of affairs that results causes
inefficiency and poor overall
performance.


It's not because Intel loved
ambiguity that we became a hybrid
organization. We have tried
everything else, and while other


models may have been less
ambiguous, they simply didn't
work. Hybrid organizations and the
accompanying dual reporting
principle, like a democracy, are not
great in and of themselves. They
just happen to be the best way for
any business to be organized.


Making Hybrid Organizations Work


To make hybrid organizations work,
you need a way to coordinate the
mission-oriented units and the
functional groups so that the
resources of the latter are allocated

and delivered to meet the needs of

the former. Consider how the


controller works at Intel. His
professional methods, practices,
and standards are set by the
functional group to which he
belongs, the finance organization.
Consequently, the controller for a
business unit should report to
someone in both the functional and
the mission-oriented organizations,
with the type of supervision
reflecting the varying needs of the
two. The divisional general manager
gives the controller missionoriented priorities by asking him to
work on specific business problems.
The finance manager makes sure
that the controller is trained to do


his work in a technically proficient
manner, supervises and monitors
his technical performance, and
looks after his career inside finance,
promoting him, perhaps, to the
position of controller of a bigger,
more complex division if he
performs well. Again, as shown
opposite, this is dual reporting, the
management principle that enables
the hybrid organization form to
work.


The example has parallels
throughout a corporation.

The controller for a business
division should be supervised by
both organizations.


Consider advertising. Should each
business division devise and pursue
its own advertising campaign, or
should all of it be handled through
a single corporate entity? As before,
there are pros and cons on both
sides. Each division clearly
understands its own strategy best,
and therefore presumably best
understands what its advertising
message should be and to whom it
should be aimed. This would


suggest that advertising stay in the
hands of the divisions. On the other
hand, the products of various
divisions often all serve the needs
of a specific market, and taken
together represent a much more
complete solution to the customers'
needs than what can be provided by
an individual division. Here the

customer and hence the
manufacturer clearly benefit if all
the advertising stories are told in a
coherent, coordinated fashion. Also,
advertising sells not just a specific
product but the entire corporation
as well. Because the ads ought to
project a consistent image that is


right for everybody, we


should at the very least not let a
division go out and hire its own
advertising agency.


As with much else in a hybrid
organization, the optimum solution
here calls for the use of dual
reporting. The divisional marketing
managers should control most of
their own advertising messages. But
a coordinating body of peers
consisting of the various divisional
marketing managers and perhaps
chaired by the corporate
merchandising manager should
provide the necessary functional


supervision for all involved. This
body would choose the advertising
agency, for instance, and determine
the graphic image to which all
divisional ads should conform. It
could also define the way the
division marketing managers would
deal with the agency, which could
reduce the cost of space through the
use of volume buying. Yet the
specific selling message
communicated by an individual ad
would be mainly left to the
divisional people.


Dual reporting can certainly tax the
patience of the marketing
managers, as they are now also


required to understand the needs
and thought processes of their
peers. But no real alternative exists
when you need to communicate
individual product and market
messages and maintain a corporate
identity at the same time.


We have seen that all kinds of
organizations evolve into a hybrid
organizational form. They must also
develop a system of dual reporting.
Consider the following story about
Ohio University that appeared in
the Wall Street Journal (bracketed
comments are mine):


A university is an odd place to


manage. The president of the
University said, "There's clearly a
shared responsibility for decisionmaking between administration

[functional organization] and
faculty [mission-oriented
organization]." A University
Planning Advisory Council [a group
of peers] was formed with
representation from the faculty and
administra

tion to help allocate limited
resources [a most difficult and
common problem] in the face of
severe budget cuts, "We are being
educated to think institutionally,"
said one council member. "I'm


representing student affairs, which
had some projects up for
consideration this year. But I made
a big pitch for buying a new
bulldozer."


So to put it yet another way, the
hybrid organizational form is the
inevitable consequence of enjoying
the benefits of being part of a large
organization—a company or
university or whatever. To be sure,
neither that form nor the need for
dual reporting is an excuse for
needless busywork, and we should
mercilessly slash away unnecessary
bureaucratic hindrance, apply work
simplification to all we do, and


continually subject all established
requirements for coordination and
consultation to the test of common
sense. But we should not expect to
escape from complexity by playing
with reporting arrangements. Like
it or not. the hybrid organization is
a fundamental phenomenon of
organizational life.


Another Wrinkle: The Two-Plane
Organization


Whenever a person becomes
involved in coordination—
something not part of his regular
daily work—we encounter a subtle
variation of dual reporting.


Remember Cindy, the know-how
manager responsible for
maintaining and improving a
specific manufacturing process?
Cindy reports to a supervising
engineer, who in turn reports to the
engineering manager of the plant.
In her daily work, Cindy keeps
things going by manipulating the
manufacturing equipment,
watching the process monitors, and
making adjustments when
necessary. But Cindy has another
job, too. She meets formally once a
month with her counterparts from
the other production plants to
identify, discuss, and solve


problems related to


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


the process for which they are each
responsible in their respective
plants. This coordinating group also
works to standardize procedures
used at all plants. The work of
Cindy's group, and others like it, is
supervised by another more senior
group (called the Engineering
Managers Council), which is made
up of the engineering managers
from all the plants.


Cindy's various reporting
relationships can be found in the


figure below. As we can see, as a
process engineer in the production
plant, where she spends 80 percent
of her time, Cindy has a clear, crisp
reporting arrangement to her
supervising engineer, and through
him, to the

(Jindy


Cindy


plant engineering manager. But as a
member of the process coordinating
group, she is also supervised by its
chairman. So we see that Cindy's
name appears on two organization
charts that serve two separate
purposes— one to operate the
production plant, the other to
coordinate the efforts of various


plants. Again we see dual reporting
because Cindy has two supervisors.


Cindy's two responsibilities won't
fit on a single organization chart.
Instead, we have to think of the
coordinating group as existing on a
different chart, or on a different
plane. This sounds complicated but
really isn't. If Cindy belonged to a
church, she would be regarded a
member of that organization as well
as being part of Intel. Her
supervisor there, as it were, would
be the local pastor, who in turn is a
member of the church hierarchy.
No one would confuse these two
roles: clearly operating on different


planes, each has its own
hierarchies, and that Cindy is a
member of both groups at the same
time would hardly trouble anyone.
Cindy's being part of a coordinating
group is like her church
membership.


Our ability to use Cindy's skill and
know-how in two different
capacities makes it possible for her
to exert a much larger leverage at
Intel. In her main job, her
knowledge affects the work that
takes place in one plant; in her
second, through what she does in
the process coordinating group, she
can influence the work of all plants.


So we see that the existence of such
groups is a way for managers,
especially know-how managers, to
increase their leverage.


The two-plane concept is a part of
everyday organizational life. For
instance, while people mosdy work
at an operating task, they also plan.
The hierarchy of the corporation's
planning bodies lies on a plane
separate from the one on which
you'll find the operating groups.
Moreover, if a person can operate in
two planes, he can operate in three.
Cindy could also be part of a task
force to


achieve a specific result in which
her expertise is needed. This is as if
Cindy were to work at Intel, to
belong to a church, and to do
advisory work for the town's parks
department, l hese are separate
roles and do not conflict with one
another, though they all do vie for
Cindy's time.


It could also turn out that people
who are in a
subordinate/supervisory
relationship in one plane might find
the relationship reversed in
another. For example, I am
president of Intel, but in another
plane I am a member of a strategic


planning group, where I report to
its chairman, who is one of our
division controllers. It's as if I were
a member of the Army Reserve, and
on our weekend exercises I found
myself under the command of a
regimental leader who happens to
be this division controller, back at
the operating ranch, I may be his
supervisor or his supervisor's
supervisor, but in the Army Reserve
he is my commanding officer.


The point is that the two- (or multi) plane organization is very useful.
Without it I could only partiripate if
I were in charge of everything I was
part of. I don't have that kind of


time, and often I'm not the most
qualified person around to lead. The
multi-plane organization enables
me to serve as a foot soldier rather
than as a general when appropriate
and useful. This gives the
organization important flexibility.


Many of the groups that we are
talking about here are temporary.
Some, like task forces, are
specifically formed for a purpose,
while others are merely an informal
collection of people who work
together to solve a particular
problem. Both cease to work as a
group once the problem has been
handled. The more varied the


nature of the problems we face and
the more rapidly things change
around us, the more we have to rely
on such specially composed
transitory teams to cope with
matters. In the electronics business,
we can't possibly shift formal
organization fast enough to keep up
with the pace of ad vane

ing technology. The techniques that
we have to master to make hybrid
organizations work—dual or
multiple reporting and also
decision-making by peer groups—
are both necessary if such
transitory teams are to work. The
key factor common to all is the use


of cultural values as a mode of
control, which we will consider

next.


10


Modes of Control


Let's look at the ways in which our
actions can be controlled or
influenced. Say you need new tires
for your car. You go down the street
to the dealer and take a look at the

various lines he has to offer. Then
you'll probably go up the street to
see what the competition has.
Maybe later you'll turn to a
consumer magazine to helD von


choose. Eventually, you'll make a
decision based on one tiling: your
own self-interest. You want to buy
the tires you think will meet your
needs at the lowest cost to you. It is
quite unlikely that any personal
feelings toward the tire dealer will
come to mind. You are not

concerned about fas welfare—
there's not much chance that you
would say to him that he isn't
charging you enough for the tires.
Now you have the tires on your car
and you drive off Alter a while, you
come to a red light. You stop. Do
you thmk about it? No. It's a law
established bv the societv at large


that everybody stops at a red light
and you unquestiomngly accept and
live by it. Vehicular chaos would
reign if aH drivers had not entered
into a contract co scop, i he tramc
cop monitors adherence and
penalizes those who break the law.


After the light changes, you
continue on down the roa^ and
come upon the scene of a major
accident. Quite


likely, you'll forget about laws like
not stopping on a freeway and also
forget about your own self-interest:
you'll probably do everything you
can to help the accident victims


and, in the meantime, expose
yourself to all kinds of dangers and
risks. What motivates you now is
not at all what did when you were
shopping for tires or stopping at the
red light: not self-interest or
obeying the law, but concern about
someone else's life.


Similarly, our behavior in a work
environment can be controlled by
three invisible and pervasive
means. These are:


- free-market forces


- contractual obligations


- cultural values


Free-Market Forces


When you bought your tires, your
actions were governed by freemarket forces, which are based on
price: goods and services are being
exchanged between two entities
(individuals, organizational units,
or corporations), with each seeking
only to enrich himself or itself. This
is very simple. It is a matter of "I
want to buy the tire at the lowest
price I can get" versus "I want to
sell the tire at the highest price I
can get." Neither party here cares if
the other goes bankrupt, nor do


they pretend to. This is a very
efficient way to buy and sell tires.
No one is needed to oversee the
transaction because everyone is
openly serving his own self-interest.


So why aren't the forces of the
marketplace used all the time in all
circumstances? Because to work,
the goods and services bought and
sold must possess a very clearly
defined dollar value. The free
market can easily establish a price
for something as simple as tires.
But for much else that changes
hands in a work or business
environment, value is hard to
establish.


*46 HIGH OUTPUT
MANAGEMENT


Contractual Obligations


Transactions between companies
are usually governed by the free
market. When we buy a commodity
product from a vendor, we are
trying to get it at the best possible
price, and vice versa. But what
happens when the value of
something is not easily denned?
What happens, for instance, when it
takes a group of people to
accomplish a certain task? How
much does each of them contribute

to the value the business adds to


the product? The point is that how
much an engineer is worth in a
group cannot be pinned down by
appealing to the free market. In
fact, if we bought engineering work
by the "bit," I think we would end
up spending more time trying to
decide the value of each bit of

contribution than the contribution
itself is worth. Here trying to use
free-market concepts becomes quite
inefficient.


So you say to the engineers, "Okay,
I'll retain your services for a year
for a set amount of money, and you
will agree to do a certain type of
work in return. We've now entered


into a contract. I'll give you an
office and a terminal, and you
promise me to do the best you can
to perform your task."


The nature of control is now based
on contractual obligations, which
define the kind of work you will do
and the standards that will govern
it. Because I can't specify in advance
exactly what you will do from day to
day, I must have a fair amount of
generalized authority over your
work. So you must give to me as
part of the contract the right to
monitor and evaluate and, if
necessary, correct your work. We
agree on other guidelines and work


out rules that we will both obey.


In return for stopping at a red light,
we count on other drivers to do the
same thing, and we can drive
through green lights. But for
lawbreakers we need policemen,
and with them, as with supervisors,
we introduce overhead.


What are some other examples of
contractual obligation? Take the tax
system. We surrender the right to
some of what we earn and expect
certain services in return. Giant
overhead is necessary to monitor
and audit our tax returns. A utility
company presents another example.


Its representatives will go to
somebody who works for the
government and say, "I'll build a
three-hundred-million-dollar
generating plant and provide
electricity for this portion of the
state if you promise me that no one
else will build one and try to sell
electricity here." The state says,
"Well, that's fine, but we're not
going to let you charge whatever
you want for the power you
generate. We'll establish a
monitoring agency called the Public
Utilities Commission and they'll tell
you how much you can charge
consumers and how much profit


you can make." So, in exchange for
a monopoly, the company is
contractually obliged to accept the
government's decision on pricing
and profit.


Cultural Values


When the environment changes
more rapidly than one can change
rules, or when a set of
circumstances is so ambiguous and
unclear that a contract between the
parties that attempted to cover all
possibilities would be prohibitively
complicated, we need another mode
of control, which is based on
cultural values. Its most important


characteristic is that the interest of
the larger group to which an
individual belongs takes precedence
over the interest of the individual

himself. When such values are at
work, some emotionally loaded
words come into play—words like
trust —because you are
surrendering to the group your
ability to protect yourself. And for
this to happen, you must believe
that you all share a common set of
values, a common set of objectives,
and a common set of methods.
These, in turn, can only be
developed by a great deal of
common, shared experience.


The Role of Management


Y ?- don l need mana gement to
supervise the workings of freemarket forces; no one supervises
sales made at a flea market. In a
contractual obligation, management
has a role in setting and modifying
the rules, monitoring adherence to
them, and evaluating and improving
performance. As for cultural
values,"management has to develop
and nurture the common set of
values, objectives, and methods
essential for the existence of trust.
How do we do that? One way is by
articulation, by spelling out these
values, objectives, and methods.


The other, even more important,
way is by example. If our behavior
at work will be regarded as in line
with the values we profess, that
fosters the development of a group
culture.


The Most Appropriate Mode of
Control


There is a temptation to idealize
what I've called cultural values as a

mode of control because it is so
"nice," even Utopian, because
everybody presumably cares about
the common good and subjugates
self-interest to that common good.
But this is not the most efficient


mode of control under all
conditions. It is no guide to buying
tires, nor could the tax system work
this way. Accordingly, given a
certain set of conditions, there is
always a most appropriate mode of
control, which we as managers
should find and use.


How do we do that? There are two
variables here: first, the nature of a
person's motivation; and second,
the nature of the environment in
which he works. An imaginary
composite index can be applied to
measure an environment's
complexity, uncertainty, and
ambiguity, which we'll call the CUA


factor. Cindy, the process engineer,
is surrounded by tricky
technologies," new and not fully
operational equipment, and
development engineers and
production engineers pulling her in

directions. Her working
environment, in short, is complex.
Bruce, the marketing manager, has
asked for permission to hire more
people for his grossly understaffed
group; his supervisor waffles, and
Bruce is left with no idea if he'll get
the go-ahead or what to do if he
doesn't. Bruce's working
environment is uncertain. Mike,
whom we will now introduce as an
Intel transportation supervisor, had
to deal with so many committees,
councils, and divisional


manufacturing managers that he
didn't know which, if any, end was
up. He eventually quit, unable to
tolerate the ambiguity of his
working environment.


Let's now conceive a simple chart
with four quadrants, shown above.
The individual motivation can run

from


»5° HIGH OUTPUT
MANAGEMENT


self-interest to group-interest, and
the CUA factor of a working
environment can vary from low to
high. Now look for the best mode of


control for each quadrant. When
self-interest is high and the CUA
factor is low, the most appropriate
is the market mode, which
governed our tire purchase. As
individual motivation moves toward
group interest, the contractual
mode becomes appropriate, which
governed our stopping for a red
light. When group-interest
orientation and the CUA factor are
both high, the cultural values mode
becomes the best choice, which
explains to us why we tried to help
at the scene of the accident. And
finally, when the CUA factor is high
and individual motivation is based


on self-interest, no mode of control
will work well. This situation, like
every man for himself on a sinking
ship, can only produce chaos.


Let's apply our model to the work of
a new employee. What is his
motivation? It is very much based
on self-interest. So you should give
him a clearly structured job with a
low CUA factor. If he does well, he
will begin to feel more at home,
worry less about himself, and start
to care more about his team. He

learns that if he is on a boat and
wants to get ahead, it is better for
him to help row than to run to the
bow. The employee can then be


promoted into a more complex,
uncertain, ambiguous job. (These
tend to pay more.) As time passes,
he will continue to gain an
increasing amount of shared
experience with other members of
the organization and will be ready
to tackle more and more complex,
ambiguous, and uncertain tasks.
This is why promotion from within
tends to be the approach favored by
corporations with strong corporate
cultures. Bring young people in at
relatively low-level, well-defined
jobs with low CUA factors, and over
time they will share experiences
with their peers, supervisors, and


subordinates and will learn the
values, objectives, and


methods of the organization. They
will gradually accept, even flourish
in, the complex world of multiple
bosses and peer decision-making.


But what do we do when for some

reason we have to hire a senior
person from outside the company?
Like any other new hire, he too will
come in having high self-interest,
but inevitably we will give him an
organization to manage that is in
trouble; after all, that was our
reason for going outside. So not
only does our new manager have a


tough job facing him, but his
working environment will have a
very high CUA. Meanwhile, he has
no base of common experience with
the rest of the organization and no
knowledge of the methods used to
help him work. All we can do is
cross our fingers and hope he
quickly forgets self-interest and just
as quickly gets on top of his job to
reduce his CUA factor. Short of that,
he's probably out of luck.


Modes of Control at Work


At any one time, one of the three
modes of control may govern what
we are doing. But from one day to


the next, we find ourselves
influenced by all three. Let's track
Bob's mode of control for a bit.
When Bob, a marketing supervisor,
buys his lunch in the cafeteria, he's
influenced by market forces. His
choices are well defined and based
on what he wants to buy and what
he wants to pay. Bob's coming to
work in the first place represents a
transaction governed by contractual
obligations. He is paid a set salary
for doing his best, which implies
that he has to show up. And his
willingness to participate in
strategic planning activities shows
cultural values at work. This is work


outside of his "regular" job as
defined contractually, and so
represents extra effort for him. But
he does it because he feels the
company needs what he has to
contribute.


Let's now consider what goes on
during the course of a work project.
As we know, Barbara's "department
is responsible for training the Intel
sales force in her division's
products. When she buys materials
used in the training program, freemarket forces reign as binders of
the required quality are purchased
at the lowest possible price. The
existence of the training program


itself, however, presents an
example of contractual obligations
at work. The salespeople expect that
each division will provide training
on a regular basis. While the
program isn't a mandated
requirement spelled out somewhere
in a formal policy statement, its
basis is nonetheless contractual.
The point is, expectations can be as
binding as a legal document.


When a number of divisions share a
common sales force, each of them
has a vested interest to train
representatives to promote and sell
its products. At the same time,
unless the divisions are willing to


sacrifice self-interest in favor of the
common interest, the training
sessions can easily become
disjointed free-for-alls and confuse
everybody, So the need to have the
individual divisions present
coordinated messages is governed
by corporate values. Thus, in field
sales training, we find all three
modes of control at work.


Recently a group of factory
marketing managers claimed that
our salespeople were governed only
by self-interest. They said that they
devoted most of their attention to
selling those items that produced
the most commissions and


bonuses. Irritated and a bit selfrighteous, the managers felt they
were much more concerned about
the common good of the company
than were their colleagues in the
field.


But the marketing departments
themselves created the monster. To
get the sales force to favor
particular products, the divisions
had for some time been running
contests, with prizes ranging from
cash bonuses to trips to exotic
places. The marketing managers
were compet

ing against one another for a finite


and valuable resource: the

salesmen's time. And the salesmen
merely responded as one might
expect-But salespeople can also
behave in the opposite fashion. At
one time, one of our divisions had
serious problems, leaving the sales
engineers with no product to sell
for nearly a year. They could have
left Intel and immediately gotten
other jobs and quick commissions
elsewhere, but by and large they
stayed with us. They stayed because
they believed in the company and
had faith that eventually things
would get better. Belief and faith
are not aspects of the market mode,


but stem from adherence to cultural

values.

The Sports Analogy


Earlier I built a case summed up by
the key sentence: A manager's
output is the output of the
organization under his supervision
or influence.


Put another way, this means that


management is a team activity. But
no matter how well a team is put
together, no matter how well it is
directed, the team will perform only
as well as the individuals on it. In
other w r ords, everything we've
considered so far is useless unless

the members of our team will
continually try to offer the best they
can do. The means a manager has at
his disposal to elicit peak individual
performance are what the rest of
this book is about.


When a person is not doing his job,
there can only be two reasons for it.
The person either can't do it or
won't do it; he is either not capable


or not motivated. To determine
which, we can employ a simple
mental test: if the person's life
depended on doing the work, could
he do it? If the answer is yes, that
person is not motivated; if the
answer is no, he is not capable. If
my life depended on playing the
violin on command, I could not do
it. But if I had to run a mile in six
minutes, I probably could. Not that
I would want to, but if my life
depended on it, I probably could.


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


The single most important task of a
manager is to elicit peak


performance from his subordinates.
So if two things limit high output, a
manager has two ways to tackle the
issue: through training and
motivation. Each, as we see in the
next figure, can improve a person's
performance. In this chapter, our
concern is motivation.


INDIVIDUAL CAPABILTTY


A manager has two ways to improve
performance: training and
motivation.


How does a manager motivate his
subordinates? For most of us, the
word implies doing something to


another person. But I don't think
that can happen, because
motivation has to come from within
somebody. Accordingly, all a
manager can do is create an
environment in which motivated
people can flourish.


Because better motivation means
better performance, not a change of
attitude or feeling, a subordinate's
saying "I feel motivated" means
nothing. What matters is if he


performs better or worse because
his environment changed. An
attitude may constitute an
indicator, a "window into the black


box" of human motivation, but it is
not the desired result or output.
Better performance at a given skill
level is.


For most of Western history,
including the early days of the
Industrial Revolution, motivation
was based mostly on fear of
punishment. In Dickens' time, the
threat of loss of life got people to
work, because if people did not
work, they were not paid and could
not buy food, and if they stole food
and got caught, they were hanged.
The fear of punishment indirectly
caused them to produce more than
they might have otherwise.


Over the past thirty years or so, a
number of new approaches have
begun to replace older practices
keyed to fear. Perhaps the
emergence of the new, humanistic
approaches to motivation can be
traced to the decline in the relative
importance of manual labor and the
corresponding rise in the
importance of so-called knowledge
workers. The output of a manual
laborer is readily measurable, and
departures from the expected can
be spotted and dealt with
immediately. But for a knowledge
worker, such departures take longer
to determine because even the


expectations themselves are very
difficult to state precisely. In other
words, fear won't work as well with
computer architects as with galley
slaves; hence, new approaches to
motivation are needed.


My description of what makes
people perform relies heavily on
Abraham Maslow's theory of
motivation, simply because my own
observations of working life
confirm Maslow's concepts. For
Maslow, motivation is closely tied
to the idea of needs, which cause
people to have drives, which in turn
result in motivation. A need once
satisfied stops being a need and


therefore stops being a source of
motivation. Simply put, if we are to
create and maintain a high degree
of motivation, we must keep some
needs unsatisfied at all times.


*6° HIGH OUTPUT

MANAGEMENT


People, of course, tend to have a
variety of concurrent needs, but one
among them is always stronger
than the others. And that need is
the one that largely determines an
individual's motivation and
therefore his level of performance.
Maslow defined a set of needs, as
shown below, that tend to lie in a


hierarchy: when a lower need is
satisfied, one higher is likely to take

over.


Maslow defined a set of needs that


tend to lie in a hierarchy: when a
lower need is satisfied, one higher
is likely to take


over.


Physiological Needs


These needs consist of things that
money can buy, like xoo^, ciotiniig,
and other basic necessities of life.

Fear is


hitched to such needs: one fears the
possible deprivation of food,
clothing, and so on.


Security /Safety Needs


These come from a desire to protect
oneself from slipping back to a state
of being deprived of the basic
necessities. Safety and security
needs are fulfilled, for example,
when medical insurance provides
employees protection against the
fear of going bankrupt trying to pay
doctor and hospital fees. The
existence of benefits is rarely a
dominant source of employee
motivation, but if benefits were
absent and employees had to worry
about such concerns, performance
would no doubt be badly affected,


Social/Affiliation Needs


The social needs stem from the
inherent desire of human beings to
belong to some group or other. But
people don't want to belong to just
any group; they need to belong to
one whose members possess
something in common with
themselves. For example, when
people are excited, confident, or
happy, they want to be around
people who are also excited,
confident, or happy. Conversely,
misery loves not just any company,
but the company of other miserable
people. Nobody who is miserable
wants to be around someone happy.


Social needs are quite powerful. A


friend of mine decided to go back to
work after many years of minding
her home. She took a low-paying
job, which did little for her family's
standard of living. For a long time, I
didn't understand why she did what
she did, but finally it dawned on
me: she needed the companionship
her work offered. Going to work
meant being around a group of
people she liked.


Another example of the power of
social needs is pro

vided by Jim, a young engineer. His
first job after he graduated from
college was with a very large, long

established company, while his two
college roommates came to work at
Intel. Because Jim continued to
room with them, he was exposed to
what working within Intel was like.
Moreover, most of his roommates'
friends from work were also young,
unmarried, and just a year or two
out of college, while most of the
people where Jim worked were
married and at least ten years older.
Jim felt left out, and his need for a
group in which he felt comfortable
prompted him to come to work at
Intel, though he very much enjoyed
his work at the other company. As
one's environment or condition in


life changes, one's desire to satisfy a
particular set of needs is replaced
by a desire to satisfy another set.
There's the story of a young Intel
manager, Chuck, when he was a
first-year student at the Harvard
Business School. Initially, he was
engulfed by a fear of the class
material, of his professors, of
failure, of flunking out. After a
while his fear gave way tu the
realization that everyone else was
in the same boat, also afraid.
Students began to form study
groups whose ostensible purpose
was to consider class material
together, but whose real purpose


was to strengthen confidence.
Chuck moved from being governed
largely bv his need for sheer
survival—a "physiological" need—
toone for security and safety. As
time went on, the studv ctouds
dissolved and the students started

to associate with other members of
the class. The entire class, or
"section." as it was called, developed
a definite and recognizable set of
characteristics; it became, in short,
a team. Members enjoyed
belonging, associating, and
identifying with it, and worked to
sustain the section's image amone
the professors and other students.


Chuck was now satisfying his need
for affiliation.


Of course, regressive movement is
also possible. Recently, a highly
motivated, smoothly working team
of manufacturing employees in one
of our California plants


was suddenly jolted—all too literally
—from satisfying a very high level
of human needs to abandoning an
inventory of silicon wafers,
expensive manufacturing
equipment, even friends. An
earthquake shook their factory.
People feared for their lives,
dropped everything, and ran to the


nearest exit as they found
themselves totally consumed by the
most fundamental of all
physiological needs—survival.


The physiological, safety/security,
and social needs all can motivate us
to show up for work, but other
needs— esteem and selfactualization—make us perform
once we are there.


Esteem/Recognition Needs


The need for esteem or recognition
is readily apparent in the cliche
"keeping up with the Joneses." Such
striving is commonly frowned upon,


but if an athlete's "Jones" is last
year's Olympic gold medalist, or if
an actor's "Jones" is Laurence
Olivier, the need to keep up with or
emulate someone is a powerful
source of positive motivation. The
person or group whose recognition
you desire may mean nothing to
someone else—esteem exists in the
eyes of the beholder. If you are an
aspiring high school athlete and one
of the top players passes you in the
hall and says hello, you'll feel
terrific. Yet if you try to tell your
family or friends how pleased you w
T ere about the encounter, you are
likely to be met with blank stares,


because the "hello" means nothing
to people who are not aspiring
athletes in your high schooL


All of the sources of motivation

we've talked about so far are selflimiting, That is, when a need is
gratified, it can no longer motivate a
person. Once a predetermined goal
or level of achievement is reached,
the need to go any further loses
urgency, A friend of mine was
thrust into a premature "mid-life
crisis" when, in recognition of the
excellent work he had been doing,
he was named a


vice president of the corporation.


Such a position had been a life-long
goal. When he had suddenly
attained it, he found himself
looking for some other way to
motivate himself.


Self-Actualization Needs


For Maslow, self-actualization
stems from a personal realization
that "what I can be, I must be." The
title of a movie about athletes,
Personal Best, captures what selfactualization means: the need to
achieve one's utter personal best in
a chosen field of endeavor. Once

someone's source of motivation is
self-actualization, his drive to


perform has no limit. Thus, its most
important characteristic is that
unlike other sources of motivation,
which extinguish themselves after
the needs are fulfilled, selfactualization continues to motivate
people to ever higher levels of
performance.


Two inner forces can drive a person
to use all of his capabilities. He can
be competence -driven or
achievement-driven. The former
concerns itself with job or task
mastery. A virtuoso violinist who
continues to practice day after day
is obviously moved by something
other than a need for esteem and


recognition. He works to sharpen
his own skill, trying to do a little bit
better this time than the time
before, just as a teenager on a
skateboard practices the same trick
over and over again. The same
teenager may not sit still for ten
minutes to do homework, but on a
skateboard he is relentless, driven
by the self-actualization need, a
need to get better that has no limit.


The achievement-driven path to
self-actualization is not quite like
this. Some people— not the
majority—are moved by an abstract
need to achieve in all that they do. A
psychology lab experiment


illustrated the behavior of such
people. Some volunteers were put
into a room in which pegs were set
at various places on the floor. Each
person was given some rings but
not instructed what to


do with them. People eventually
started to toss the rings onto the
pegs. Some casually tossed the rings
at faraway pegs; others stood over
the pegs and dropped the rings
down onto them. Still others walked
just far enough away from the pegs
so that to toss a ring onto a peg
constituted a challenge. These
people worked at the boundary of
their capability.


Researchers classified the three
types of behavior. The first group,
termed gamblers, took high risks
but exerted no influence on the

outcome of events. The second
group, termed conservatives, were
people who took very little risk. The
third group, termed achievers, had
to test the limits of what they could
do, and with no prompting
demonstrated the point of the
experiment: namely, that some
people simply must test
themselves. By challenging
themselves, these people were
likely to miss a peg several times,
but when they began to ring the peg


consistently, they gained
satisfaction and a sense of
achievement. The point is that both
competence- and achievementoriented people spontaneously try
to test the outer limits of their

abilities.


When the need to stretch is not
spontaneous, management needs to
create an environment to foster it.
In an MBO system, for example,
objectives should be set at a point
high enough so that even if the
individual (or organization) pushes
himself hard, he will still only have
a fifty-fifty chance of making them.
Output will tend to be greater when


everybody strives for a level of
achievement beyond his immediate
grasp, even though trying means
failure half the time. Such goalsetting is extremely important if
what you want is peak performance
from yourself and your
subordinates.


Moreover, if we want to cultivate
achievement-driven motivation, we
need to create an environment that
values and emphasizes output. My
first job was with a research and
development laboratory, where a lot
of people were very highly
motivated but tended to be


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


knowledge-centered. They were
driven to know more, but not
necessarily to know more in order
to produce concrete results.
Consequently, relatively little was
actually achieved. The value system
at Intel is completely the reverse.
The Ph.D. in computer science who
knows an answer in the abstract,
yet does not apply it to create some
tangible output, gets little
recognition, but a junior engineer
who produces results is highly
valued and esteemed. And that is

how it should be.


Money and Task-Relevant Feedback


We now come to the question of
how money motivates people. At
the lower levels of the motivation
hierarchy, money is obviously
important, needed to buy the
necessities of life. Once there is
enough money to bring a person up
to a level he expects of himself,
more money will not motivate.
Consider people who work at our
assembly plant in the Caribbean.
The standard of living there is quite
low, and people who work for us
enjoy one substantially higher than
most of the population. Yet, in the
early years of operation, many


employees worked just long enough
to accumulate some small sum of
money and then quit. For them,
money's motivation was clearly
limited; having reached a
predetermined notion of how much
money they wanted, more money
and a steady job provided no more
motivation.


Now consider a venture capitalist
who after making ten million
dollars is still very hard at work
trying to make another ten.
Physiological, safety, or social needs
hardly apply here. Moreover,
because venture capitalists usually
don't publicize their successes, they


are not driven by a need for esteem
or recognition. So it appears that at
the upper level of the need
hierarchy, when one is selfactualized, money in itself is no
longer a source of motivation but
rather a measure of achievement.
Money in the physiological- and
security-driven modes only moti

vates until the need is satisfied, but
money as a measure of
achievement will motivate without

limit. Thus the second ten million
can be just as important to the
venture capitalist as the first, since
it is not the utilitarian need for the
money that drives him but the


achievement that it implies, and the
need for achievement is boundless.


A simple test can be used to
determine where someone is in the
motivational hierarchy. If the
absolute sum of a raise in salary an
individual receives is important to
him, he is working mostly within
the physiological or safety modes.
If, however, what matters to him is
how his raise stacks up against
what other people got, he is
motivated by esteem/recognition or
self-actualization, because in this
case money is clearly a measure.


Once in the self-actualization mode,


a person needs measures to gauge
his progress and achievement. The
most important type of measure is
feedback on his performance. For
the self-actualized person driven to
improve his competence, the
feedback mechanism lies within

that individual himself. Our

virtuoso violinist knows how the
music should sound, knows when it
is not right, and will strive tirelessly
to get it right. Accordingly, if the
possibility for improvement does
not exist, the desire to keep
practicing vanishes. I knew an
Olympic fencing champion, a
Hungarian who immigrated to this


country. When I ran into him
recently, he told me that he had
quit fencing shordy after arriving in
the U.S. He said that the level of
competition here was not high
enough to produce someone who
could give him a contest, and that
he couldn't bear to fence any longer
because every time he did, he felt
his skill was diminishing.


What are some of the feedback

mechanisms or measures in the
workplace? The most appropriate
measures tie an employee's
performance to the workings of the
organization. If performance
indicators and milestones in a


management-by-objectives system
are linked to the performance of the
individual, they will gauge his
degree


of success and will enhance his
progress. An obvious and very
important responsibility of a
manager is to steer his people away
from irrelevant and meaningless
rewards, such as office size or
decor, and toward relevant and
significant ones. The most
important form of such taskrelevant feedback is the
performance review every
subordinate should receive from his
supervisor. More about this later.


Fear


In physiological and security/safety
need-dominated motivation, one
fears the loss of life or limb or loss
of job or liberty. Does fear have a
place in the esteem or selfactualized modes? It does, but here
it becomes the fear of failure. But is
that a positive or negative source of
motivation? It can be either. Given
a specific task, fear of failure can
spur a person on, but if it becomes a
preoccupation, a person driven by a
need to achieve will simply become
conservative. Let's think back to the
ring tossers. If a person got an
electrical shock each time he threw


a ring and missed, soon enough he
would walk over to the peg and drop
the ring from directly over it to
eliminate the pain associated with
failure.


In general, in the upper levels of
motivation, fear is not something
coming from the outside. It is
instead fear of not satisfying
yourself that causes you to back off.
You cannot stay in the selfactualized mode if you're always
worried about failure.


The Sports Analogy


We've studied motivation to try to


understand what makes people
want to work so that as managers
we can elicit peak performance
from our subordinates—their
"personal best." Of course, what we
are really after is the


performance of the organization as
a whole, but that depends on how
skilled and motivated the people
within it are. Thus, our role as
managers is, first, to train the
individuals (to move them along
the horizontal axis shown in the
illustration on page 158), and,
second, to bring them to the point
where self-actualization motivates
them, because once there, their


motivation will be self-sustaining
and limitless.


Is there a systematic way to lead
people to self-actualization? For an
answer, let's ask another question.
Why does a person who is not
terribly interested in his work at the
office stretch himself to the limit
running a marathon? What makes
him run? He is trying to beat other
people or the stopwatch. This is a
simple model of self-actualization,
wherein people will exert
themselves to previously
undreamed heights, forcing
themselves to run farther or faster,
while their efforts fill barrels with


sweat. They will do this not for
money, but just to beat the
distance, the clock, or other people.
Consider what made Joe Frazier

box:


It astounds Joe Frazier that anyone
has to ask why he fights. "This is
what I do. I am a fighter," he says.
"It's my job. I'm just doing my job."
Joe doesn't deny the attractiveness
of money. "Who wants to work for
nothing?" But there are things more
important than money. "I don't
need to be a starjbecause I don't
need to shine. But I do need to be a
boxer, because that's what I am. It's
as simple as that."


Imagine how productive our
country would become if managers
could endow all work with the
characteristics of competitive
sports.


To try to do this, we must first
overcome cultural prejudice. Our
society respects someone's
throwing himself into sports, but
anybody who works very long hours
is regarded as sick, a workaholic. So
the prejudices of the


majority say that sports are good
and fun, but work is drudgery, a
necessary evil, and in no way a
source of pleasure.


That makes the cliche apply: if you
can't beat them, join them—endow
work with the characteristics of
competitive sports. And the best
way to get that spirit into the
workplace is to establish some rules
of the game and ways for employees
to measure themselves. Eliciting
peak performance means going up
against something or somebody. Let
me give you a simple example. For
years the performance of the Intel
facilities maintenance group, which
is responsible for keeping our
buildings clean and neat, was
mediocre, and no amount of
pressure or inducement seemed to


do any good. We then initiated a
program in which each building's
upkeep was periodically scored by a
resident senior manager, dubbed a
"building czar." The score was then
compared with those given the
other buildings. The condition of all
of them dramatically improved
almost immediately. Nothing else
was done; people did not get more
money or other rewards. What they
did get was a racetrack, an arena of
competition. If your work is
facilities maintenance, having your
building receive the top score is a
powerful source of motivation. This
is key to the manager's approach


and involvement: he has to see the
work as it is seen by the people who
do that work every day and then
create indicators so that his

subordinates can watch their
"racetrack" take shape.


Conversely, of course, when the
competition is removed, motivation
associated with it vanishes.
Consider the example of a
newspaper columnist reflecting on
his past. This journalist "thrived on
beating the competition in the
column, and his pleasure in his
work began to wane after [his paper
and the competitive paper] merged.
Til never forget that day of the


merger/the columnist said. 1
walked out to get the train, and I
just thought: There isn't anyone
else to beat.' "


Comparing our work to sports may
also teach us how to cope with
failure. As noted, one of the big
impediments to a fully committed,
highly motivated state of mind is
preoccupation with failure. Yet we
know that in any competitive sport,
at least 50 percent of all matches
are lost. All participants know that
from the outset, and yet rarely do
they give up at any stage of a

contest.


The role of the manager here is also
clear: it is that of the coach. First,
an ideal coach takes no personal
credit for the success of his team,
and because of that his players trust
him. Second, he is tough on his
team. By being critical, he tries to
get the best performance his team
members can provide. Third, a good
coach was likely a good player
himself at one time. And having
played the game well, he also
understands it well.


Turning the workplace into a
playing field can turn our
subordinates into "athletes"
dedicated to performing at the limit


of their capabilities—the key to
making our team consistent
winners.

Task-Relevant Maturity


I'll say again that a manager's most
important responsibility is to elicit
top performance from his
subordinates. Assuming we
understand what motivates an
employee, the question becomes: Is
there a single best management
style, one approach that will work
better than all others? Many have
looked for that optimum.


Considering the issue historically,
the management style most in favor
seems to have changed to parallel
the theory of motivation espoused
at the time. At the turn of the
century, ideas about work were
simple. People were told what to do,
and if they did it, they were paid; if
they did not, they were fired. The
corresponding leadership style was
crisp and hierarchical: there were
those who gave orders and those
who took orders and executed them
without question. In the 1950's,
management theory shifted toward
a humanistic set of beliefs that held
that there was a nicer way to get


people to work. The favored
leadershio stvle changed
accordingly. Finally, as university
behavioral science departments
developed and grew, the theories of
motivation and leadership became
subjects of carefully controlled
experiments. Surprisingly, none of
the early intuitive presumptions
could be borne out: the hard
findings simply would not show
that one style of leader

ship was better than another. It was
hard to escape the conclusion that
no optimal management style
existed.


My own observations bear this out.
At Intel we fre-quendy rotate
middle managers from one group to
another in order to broaden their
experience. These groups tend to be
similar in background and in the
type of work that they do, although
their output tends to vary greatly.
Some managers and their groups
demonstrate themselves to be
higher producers; others do not.
The result of moving the managers
about is often surprising. Neither
the managers nor the groups
maintain the characteristic of being
either high-producing or lowproducing as the managers are


switched around. The inevitable
conclusion is that high output is
associated with particular
combinations of certain managers
and certain groups of workers. This
also suggests that a given
managerial approach is not equally
effective under all conditions.


Some researchers in this field argue
that there is a fundamental variable
that tells you what the best
management style is in a particular
situation. That variable is the taskrelevant maturity (TRM) of the
subordinates, which is a
combination of the degree of their
achievement orientation and


readiness to take responsibility, as
well as their education, training,
and experience. Moreover, all this is
very specific to the task at hand,
and it is entirely possible for a
person or a group of people to have
a TRM that is high in one job but
low in another.


Let me give you an example of what
I mean. We re-cendy moved an
extremely productive sales manager
from the field into the plant, where
he was placed in charge of a factory
unit. The size and scope of the two
jobs were comparable, yet the
performance of the seasoned
manager deteriorated, and he


started to show the signs of
someone overwhelmed by his work.
What happened was that while the
personal maturity of the manager
obviously did not change, his taskrelevant maturity in the new job
was extremely low, since its
environment,


*74 HIGH OUTPUT
MANAGEMENT


content, and tasks were_all new to
him. In time he learned to cope, and
his TRM gradually increased. With
that, his performance began to
approach the outstanding levels he
had exhibited earlier, which was


why we promoted him in the first
place. What happened here should
have been totally predictable, yet we
were surprised: we confused the
manager's general competence and
maturity with his task-relevant
maturity.


Similarly, a person's TRM can be
very high given a certain level of
complexity, uncertainty, and
ambiguity, but if the pace of the job
accelerates or if the jobltself
abruptly changes, the TRM of that
individual will drop. It's a bit like a
person with many years' experience
driving on small country roads
being suddenly asked to drive on a


crowded metropolitan freeway. His
TRM driving his own car will drop
precipitously.


The conclusion is that varying
management styles are needed as
task-relevant maturity varies.
Specifically, when the TRM is low,
the most effective approach is one
that offers very precise and detailed
instructions, wherein the
supervisor tells the subordinate
what needs to be done, when, and
how: in other words, a highly
structured approach. As the TRM of
the subordinate grows, the most
effective style moves from the
structured to one more given to


communication, emotional support,
and encouragement, in which the
manager pays more attention to the
subordinate as an individual than to
thejask at hand. As the TRM
becomes even greater, the ettective
management style changes again.
Here the manager's involvement
should be kept to a minimum, and
should primarily consist of making
sure that the objectives toward
which the subordinate is working
are mutually agreed upon. But
regardless of what the TRM may be,
the manager should always monitor
a subordinate's work closely enough
to avoid surprises. The pres-^ce or


absence of monitoring, as we've
said before, is the difference
between a supervisor's delegating a
task and


abdicating it. The characteristics of
the effective management style for
the supervisor given the varying
degrees of TRM are summarized in
the table below.


A word of caution is in order: do not
make a value judgment and
consider a structured management
style less worthy than a
communication-oriented one. What

is "nice" or "not nice" should have
no place in how you think or what


you do. Remember, we are after
what is most effective.


The theory here parallels the
development of the relationship
between a parent and child. As the
child matures, the most effective
parental style changes, varying with
the "life-relevant maturity"—or age
—of the child. A parent needs to tell
a toddler not to touch things that he
might break or that might hurt him.
The child cannot understand that
the vase he wants to play with is an
irreplaceable heirloom, but he can
understand "no." As he grows older,
he begins to do things on his own
initiative, something the parent


wants to encourage while still

trying to keep him from injuring
himself. A parent might suggest, for
example, that his child give up his
tricycle for his first two-wheeler.
The parent will not simply send nim


out on his own, but will accompany
him to keep the bicycle from tipping
over while talking to him abouf
safety on the streets. As the child's
maturity continues to grow, the
parent can cut back on specific
instruction. When the child goes
out to ride his bicycle, the parent no
longer has to recite the litany of
safety rules. Finally, when the liferelevant maturity of the child is
hiffh enough, he leaves home and
perhaps goes away to college. At
this point the relationship between
parent and child will change again
as the parent merely monitors the
tuna's progress.


Should the child's environment
suddenly change to one where his
life-relevant maturity is inadequate
(for example, if he runs into severe
academic trouble*, the parent may
have to revert to a style used earlier.


As parental (or managerial)
supervision moves from structured
to communicating to monitoring,
the degree or structure governing
the behavior of the child (or"the
subordinate) does not really
change. A teenager knows it is not
safe to cross a busy interstate
highway on his bicy-oe an u the
parent no longer has to tell him not
to do it. Structure moves from being


externally imposed to being
internally given.


t If the parent (or supervisor)
imparted early on to the cnua (or
subordinate) the right way to do
things (the correct operational
values), later the child would be
likely to make decisions the way the
parent would In *act commonality
of operational values, priorities, and
preferences—how an organization
works together—is a must if the
progression in managerial style is to
occur. Without that commonality,
an organization can become easily
confused and lose its sense of
purpose Accordingly, the


responsibility for transmittine
common values rests squarely with
the supervisor. He Ts, after all


accountable for the output of the
people who report to him; then, too,
without a shared set of values a
supervisor cannot effectively
delegate. An associate of mine who
had always done an outstanding job
hired a junior person to handle
some old tasks, while he himself
took on some new ones. The
subordinate did poor work. My
associate's reaction: "He has to

make his own mistakes. That's how
he learns!" The problem with this is
that the subordinate's tuition is


paid by his customers. And that is
absolutely wrong. The
responsibility for teaching the
subordinate must be assumed by
his supervisor, and not paid for by
the customers of his organization,
internal or external.


Management Style and Managerial
Leverage


As supervisors, we should try to
raise the task-relevant maturity of
our subordinates as rapidly as
possible for obvious pragmatic
reasons. The appropriate
management style for an employee
with high TRM takes less time than


detailed, structured, supervision
requires. Moreover, once
operational values are learned and
TRM is high enough, the supervisor
can delegate tasks to the
subordinate, thus increasing his
managerial leverage. Finally, at the
highest levels of TRM, the
subordinate's training is
presumably complete, and
motivation is likely to come from
within, from self-actualization,
which is the most powerful source
of energy and effort a manager can
harness.


As we've learned, a person's TRM
depends on a specific working


environment. When that changes,
so will his TRM, as will his
supervisor's most effective
management style. Let's consider
an army encampment where
nothing ever happens. The sergeant
in command has come to know
each of his soldiers very well, and
by and large maintains an informal
relationship with them. The
routines are so well established that
he rarely has to tell


anyone what to do; appropriate to
the high TRM of the group, the
sergeant contents himself with
merely monitoring their activity.
One day a jeepload of the enemy


suddenly appears, coming over the
hill and shooting at the camp.
Instantly the sergeant reverts to a
structured, task-oriented leadership
style, barking orders at everyone,
telling each of his soldiers what to
do, when, and how. . .. After a while,
if these skirmishes continue and
the group keeps on fighting from
the same place for a couple of
months, this too will eventually
become routine. With that, the
TRM of the group for the new task
—fighting—will increase. The
sergeant can then gradually ease off
telling everybody what to do.


Put another way, a manager's ability


to operate in a style based on
communication and mutual
understanding depends on there
being enough time for it. Though
monitoring is on paper a manager's
most productive approach, we have
to work our way up to it in the real
world. Even if we achieve it, if
things suddenly change we have to
revert quickly to the what-whenhow mode.


That mode is one that we don't
think an enlightened manager
should use. As a result, we often
don't take it up until it is too late
and events overwhelm us. We
managers must learn to fight such


prejudices and regard any
management mode not as either
good or bad but rather as effective
or not effective, given the TRM of
our subordinates within a specific
working environment. This is why
researchers cannot find the single
best way for a manager to work. It
changes day by day and sometimes
hour by hour.


It's Not Easy to Be a Good Manager


Deciding the TRM of your
subordinates is not easy. Moreover,
even if a manager knows what the
TRM is, his personal preferences
tend to override the logical and


proper choice of management style.
For instance, even


if a manager sees that his
subordinate's TRM is "medium"
(see the table on page 175), in the
real world the manager will likely
opt for either the "structured" or
"minimal" style. In other words, we
want either to be fully immersed in
the work of our subordinates,
making their decisions, or to leave
them completely alone, not wanting
to be bothered.


Another problem here is a
manager's perception of himself.
We tend to see ourselves more as


communicators and delegators than
we really are, certainly much more
than do our subordinates. I tested
this conclusion by asking a group of
managers to assess the
management style of their
supervisors, and then by asking
those supervisors what they
thought their style was. Some 90
percent of the supervisors saw their
style as more communicating or
delegating than their subordinates'
view. What accounts for the large
discrepancy? It is partly because
managers think of themselves as
perfect delegators. But also,
sometimes a manager throws out


suggestions to a subordinate who
receives them as marching orders—
furthering the difference in
perceptions.


A manager once told me that his
supervisor definitely practiced an
effective communicating style with
him because they skied and drank
together. He was wrong. There is a
huge distinction between a social
relationship and a communicating
management style, which is a caring
involvement in the work of the
subordinate. Close relationships off
the job may help to create an
equivalent relationship on the job,
but they should not be confused.


Two people I knew had a
supervisor-subordinate
relationship. They spent one week
each year by themselves, fishing in
a remote area. When fishing, they
never talked about work—it being
tacitly understood that work was off
conversational limits. Oddly
enough, their work relationship
remained distant, their personal
friendship having no effect on it.


This brings us to the age-old
question of whether


friendship between supervisor and
subordinate is a good thing. Some
managers unhesitatingly assert that


they never permit social
relationships to develop with people
they work with. In fact, there are
pluses "and minuses here. If the
subordinate is a personal friend, the
supervisor can move into a
communicating management style
quite easily, but the what-whenhow mode becomes harder to revert
to when necessary. It's unpleasant
to give orders to a friend. I've seen
several instances where a
supervisor had to make a
subordinate-friend toe a
disciplinary line. In one case, a
friendship was destroyed; in
another, the supervisor's action


worked out because the subordinate
felt, thanks to the strength of the
social relationship, that the
supervisor was looking out for his
(the subordinate's) professional
interests.


Everyone must decide for himself
what is professional and
appropriate here. A test might be to
imagine yourself delivering a tough
performance review to your friend.
Do you cringe at the thought? If so,
don't make friends at work. If your
stomach remains unaffected, you
are likely to be someone whose
personal relationships will
strengthen work relationships.

Performance Appraisal:


Manager as Judge


and Jury


Why Bother?


Why are performance reviews a part
of the management system of most
organizations? And why do we
review the performance of our
subordinates? I posed both
questions to a group of middle
managers and got the following

responses:


to assess the subordinate's work


to improve performance


to motivate


to provide feedback to a
subordinate


to justify raises


to reward performance


to provide discipline


to provide work direction


to reinforce the company culture


Next, I asked the group to imagine
themselves to be a supervisor giving
a review to a subordinate, and asked
them what their feelings were.
Some of the answers:


pride anger anxiety


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


discomfort


guilt


empathy/concern


embarrassment


frustration


Finally, I asked the same group to
think back to some of the
performance reviews they had
received and asked what, if
anything, was wrong with them.
Their answers were quick and

many:


review comments too general


mixed messages (inconsistent with
rating or dollar


raise) no indication of how to
improve negatives avoided
supervisor didn't know my work
only recent performance considered
surprises


This should tell you that giving
performance reviews is a very
complicated and difficult business
and that we, managers, don't do an
especially good job at it.


The fact is that giving such reviews
is the single most important form
of task-relevant feedback we as
supervisors can provide. It is how
we assess our subordinates' level of
performance and how we deliver
that assessment to them
individually. It is also how we
allocate the rewards-promotions,
dollars, stock options, or whatever
we may use. As we saw earlier, the
review will influence a


subordinate's performance—
positively or negatively—for a long
time, which makes the appraisal
one of the manager's highestleverage activities. In short, the
review is an extremely powerful
mechanism, and it is little wonder
that opinions and feelings about it
are strong and diverse.


But what is its fundamental
purpose? Though all of the
responses given to my questions are
correct? there is one that is more
important than any of the others: it
is


to improve the subordinate's


performance. The review is usually
dedicated to two things: first, the
skill level of the subordinate, to
determine what skills are missing
and to find ways to remedy that
lack; and second, to intensify the
subordinate's motivation in order to
get him on a higher performance
curve for the same skill level (see
the illustration on page 158).


The review process also represents
the most formal type of
institutionalized leadership. It is
the only time a manager is
mandated to act as judge and jury:
we managers are required by the
organization that employs us to


make a judgment regarding a fellow
worker and then to deliver that
judgment to him, face to face.


A supervisor's responsibility here is
obviously very significant. What
preparation have we had to do the
job properly? About the only thing I
can think of is that as subordinates
we've been on the receiving end.
But in general our society values
avoiding confrontation. Even the
word "argument" is frowned upon,
something I learned many years ago
when I first came to this country
from Hungary. In Hungarian, the
word "argument" is frequently used
to describe a difference of opinion.


When I began to learn English and
used the word "argument," I would
be corrected, as people would say,
"Oh no, you don't mean 'argument,'
you mean 'debate,' " or "you mean
'discussion.' " Among friends and
peers you are not supposed to
discuss politics, religion, or
anything that might possibly
produce a difference of opinion and
a conflict. Football scores,
gardening, and the weather are
okay. We are taught that the wellmannered skirt potentially
emotional issues. The point is,
delivering a good performance
review is really a unique act given


both our cultural background and
our professional training.


Don't think for a moment that
performance reviews should be
confined to large organizations.
They should be part of managerial
practice in organizations of any


size and kind, from the insurance
agent with two office assistants to
administrators in education,
government, and nonprofit
organizations. The long and short of
it: if penormance matters in your
operation, performance reviews are
absolutely necessary.


Two aspects of the review—
assessing performance and
delivering the assessment—are
equally difficult Let's look at each in
a little more detail.


Assessing Performance


Determining the performance of
professional emolovees in a strictly
objective manner is very difficult
because tttere is obviously no cutand-dried way to measure and
characterize a professional
employee's work completely, most
jobs involve activities that are not
reflected by output in the time
period covered by the review. Yet


we have to give such activities
appropriate weight as we assess a
person s performance, even though
we know we won't necessarily be
objective, since only output can be
measured with true objectivity.
Anybody who supervises
professionals, therefore, walks a
tightrope: he needs to oe oojective,
but must not be afraid of using his
judgment, even though judgment is
by definition subiective. lo make an
assessment less difficult, a
supervisor s^omu ciarify in his own
mind in advance what it is that he
expects from a subordinate and
then attempt to judge wiietiier he


performed to expectations. The
biggest problem with most reviews
is that we don't usually define wnat
it is we want from our subordinates,
and, as noted earlier, if we don't
know what we want, we are surelv
nor going to get it.


Let's think back to our concept of
the managerial ^ black box. Using
it, we can characterize performance
uy output measures and internal
measures. The first represent the
output of the black box, and include
such thines as completing designs,
meeting sales quotas, or increasing


the yield in a production process—


things we can and should plot on
charts. The internal measures take
into account activities that go on
inside the black box: whatever is
being done to create output for the
period under review and also that
which sets the stage for the output
of future periods. Are we reaching
our current production goals in
such a way that tw r o months from
now w r e are likely to face a group
of disgruntled production
employees? Are we positioning and
developing people in the
organization in such a way that our
business can handle its tasks in the
future? Are we doing all of the


things that add up to a well-run
department? There is no strict
formula by which we can compare
the relative significance of output
measures and internal measures. In
a given situation, the proper
weighting could be 50/50, 90/10, or
10/90 and could even shift from
one month to the next. But at least

we should know which two
variables are being traded off
against each other,


A similar kind of trade-off also has
to be considered here: weighing
long-term-oriented against shortterm-oriented performance. An
engineer working on the design of a
product needs to complete the
project on a strict schedule to
generate revenue. He may also be
working on a design method that
will make it easier for others to
design similar products in the
future. The engineer obviously
needs both activities evaluated and

reviewed. Which is more
significant? A way to help weigh
questions like this is the idea of
"present value" used in finance:


how much will the future-oriented
activity pay back over time? And
how much is that worth today?


There is also a time factor to
consider. The subordinate's output
during the review period may have
all, some, or nothing to do with his
activities during the same period.
Accordingly, the supervisor should
look at the time offset between the
activity of the subordinate and the
output that results from that
activity. Let me explain what I
mean, because this is one lesson I
learned the hard


way. The organization of one of the


managers reporting to me had had a
superb year. All output measures
were excellent, sales increased,
profit margins were good, the
products worked—you could hardly
even think of giving anything but a
superior review to the person in
charge. Yet I had some misgivings.
Turnover in his group was higher
than it should have been, and his
people were grumbling too much.
There were other such straws in the
wind, but who could give credence
to elusive signs when tangible,
measurable performance was so
outstanding? So the manager got a
very positive review.


The next year his organization took
a nose dive. Sales growth
disappeared, profitability declined,
product development was delayed,
and the turmoil among his
subordinates deepened. As I
prepared the next review of this
manager, I struggled to sort out
what had happened. Did the
manager's performance deteriorate
as suddenly as his organization's
output measures indicated? What
was going on? I concluded that in
fact the manager's performance was
improving in the second year, even
as things seemed to go to hell. The
problem was that his performance


had not been good a year earlier.
The output indicators merely
represented work done years ago—
the light from distant stars, as it
were—which was still holding up.
The time offset between the
manager's work and the output of
his organization was just about a
year. Greatly embarrassed, I
regretfully concluded that the
superior rating I had given him was
totally wrong. Trusting the internal
measures, I should have had the
judgment and courage to give the
manager a much lower rating than I
did in spite of the excellent output
indicators that did not reflect the


year under review.


The time offset between activity
and output can also work the other
way around. In the early years of
Intel, I was called upon to review
the performance of a subordinate
who was setting up a production
facility from scratch. It had not
manufactured anything as yet, but
of


course the review could not wait for
tangible output. I had had no prior
experience supervising someone
who did not have a record of

concrete output. Here I gave my
subordinate credit for doing well,


even though output remained
uncertain. As managers, we are
really called upon to judge
performance, not just to see and
record it when it's in plain sight.


Finally, as you review a manager,
should you be judging his
performance or the performance of
the group under his supervision?
You should be doing both.
Ultimately what you are after is the
performance of the group, but the
manager is there to add value in
some way. You need to determine
what that is. You must ask: Is he
doing anything with his group? Is
he hiring new people? Is he training


the people he has, and doing other
things that are likely to improve the
output of the team in the future?
The most difficult issues in
determining a professional's
performance will be based on
asking questions and making
judgments of this sort.


One big pitfall to be avoided is the
"potential trap." At all times you
should force yourself to assess
performance, not potential By
"potential" I mean form rather than
substance, I was once asked to
approve the performance review of
a general manager whose
supervisor rated him highly for the


year. The manager was responsible
for a business unit that lost money,
missed its revenue forecast month
after month, slipped engineering
schedules, and in general showed
poor output and internal measures
over the year. Accordingly, I could
not approve the review. Whereupon
his supervisor said, "But he is an
outstanding general manager. He is
knowledgeable and han~ dies
himself well. It's his organization
that did not do well, not the
manager himself!" This cut no ice
with me because the performance
rating of a manager cannot be
higher than the one we would


accord to his organization! It is very
important to assess actual
performance, not appearances; real
output, not good form. Had the
manager been given a high


rating, Intel would have signaled to
all at the company that to do well,
you must "act" like a good manager,
talk like one, and emulate one—but
you don't need to perform like one.


A decision to promote is often
linked, as it should be, to the
performance review. We must
recognize that no action
communicates a manager's values
toan organization more clearly and


loudly than his choice of whom he
promotes. By elevating someone,
we are, in effect, creating role
models for others in our
organization. The old saying has it
that when we promote" our best
salesman and make him a manager,
we ruin a good salesman and get a
bad manager. But if we think about
it, we see we have no choice but to
promote the good salesman. Should
our worst salesman get the job?
When we promote our best, we are
saying to our subordinates that
performance is what counts.


It is hard enough for us to assess
our subordinates' performance, but


we must also try to improve it. No
matter how well a subordinate has
done his job, we can always find
ways to suggest improvement,
something about which a manager
need not feel embarrassed. Blessed
with 20/20 hindsight, we can
compare what the subordinate did
against what he might have done,
and the variance can tell both of us
how to do things better in the
future.


Delivering the Assessment


There are three L's to keep in mind
when delivering a review: Level,
listen, and leave yourself out.


You must level with your
subordinate—the credibility and
integrity of the entire system
depend on your being totally frank.
And don't be surprised to find that
praising someone in a
straightforward fashion can be just
as hard as criticizing him without
embarrassment.


The word "listen" has special
meaning here. The aim


of communication is to transmit
thoughts from the brain of person A
to the brain of person B. Thoughts
in the head of A are first converted
into words, which are enunciated


and via sound waves reach the ear
of B; as nerve impulses they travel
to his brain, where they are
transformed back into thoughts and
presumably kept. Should person A
use a tape recorder to confirm the
words used in the review? The
answer is an emphatic no. Words
themselves are nothing but a
means; getting the right thought
communicated is the end. Perhaps
B has become so emotional that he
can't understand something that
would be perfectly clear to anyone
else. Perhaps B has become so
preoccupied trying to formulate
answers that he can't really listen


and get A's message. Perhaps B has
tuned out and as a defense is
thinking of going fishing. All of
these possibilities can and do occur,
and all the more so when A's
message is laden with conflict.


How then can you be sure you are
being truly heard? What techniques
can you employ? Is it enough to
have your subordinate paraphrase
your words? I don't think so. What
you must do is employ all of your
sensory capabilities. To make sure
you're being heard, you should
watch the person you are talking to.
Remember, the more complex the
issue, the more prone


communication is to being lost.
Does your subordinate give
appropriate responses to what you
are saying? Does he allow himself
to receive your message? If his
responses —verbal and nonverbal—
do not completely assure you that
what you've said has gotten
through, it is your responsibility to
keep at it until you are satisfied that
you have been heard and
understood.


This is what I mean by listening:
employing your entire arsenal of
sensory capabilities to make certain
your points are being properly
interpreted by your subordinate's


brain. All the intelligence and good
faith used to prepare your review
will produce nothing unless this
occurs. Your tool, to say it again, is
total listening.


Every good classroom teacher
works in the same way. He knows
when what he is saying is being
understood by his students. If it
isn't, he takes heed and explains
things again or explains things in a
different way. All of us have had
professors who lectured by looking
at the blackboard, mumbling to it,
and carefully avoiding direct eye
contact with the class. The reason:
knowing that their presentation was


murky and incomprehensible, these
teachers looked away from their
audience to avoid confirming
visually what they already knew. So
don't imitate your worst professors
while delivering performance
reviews. Listen with all your might
to make sure your subordinate is
receiving your message, and don't
stop delivering it until you are
satisfied that he is.


The third L is "leave yourself out."
It is very important for you to
understand that the performance
review is about and for your
subordinate. So your own
insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or


whatever should be kept out of it.
At issue are the subordinate's
problems, not the supervisor's, and
it is the subordinate's day in court.
Anyone called upon to assess the
performance of another person is
likely to have strong emotions
before and during the review, just
as actors have stage fright. You
should work to control these
emotions sodiat they don't affect
your task, though they will well up
no matter how many reviews you've
given.


Let us now consider three types of
performance reviews.


"On the One Hand . . . On the Other

Hand ..."


Most reviews probably fall into this
category, containing both positive
and negative assessments. Common
problems here include
superficiality, cliches, and laundry
lists of unrelated observations. All
of these will leave your subordinate
bewildered and will hardly improve
his future performance, the review's
basic purpose. Let me


suggest some ways to help you
deliver this type of review.


The key is to recognize that your


subordinate, like most people, has
only a finite capacity to deal with
facts, issues, and suggestions. You
may possess seven truths about his
performance, but if his capacity is
only four, at best you'll waste your
breath on the other three. At worst
you will have left him with a case of
sensory overload, and he will go
away without getting anything out
of the review. The fact is that a
person can only absorb so many
messages at one time,' especially
when they deal with his own
performance. The purpose of the
review is not to cleanse your system
of all the truths you may have


observed about your subordinate,
but to improve his performance. So
here less may very well be more.


How can you target a few key areas?
First, consider as many aspects of
your subordinate's performance as
possible. You should scan material
such as progress reports,
performance against quarterly
objectives, and one-on-one meeting
notes. Then sit down with a blank
piece of paper. As you consider your
subordinate's performance, write
everything down on the paper. Do
not edit in your head. Get
everything down, knowing that
doing so doesn't commit you to do


anything. Things major, minor, and
trivial can be included in no
particular order. When you have
run out of items, you can put all of
your supporting documentation

away.


Now, from your worksheet, look for
relationships between the various
items listed. You will probably
begin to notice that certain items
are different manifestations of the
same phenomenon, and that there
may be some indications why a
certain strength or weakness exists.
When you find such relationships,
you can start calling them
"messages" for the subordinate. At


this point, your worksheet might
look something like that shown on
the next page. Now, again from your
worksheet, begin to


draw conclusions and specific
examples to support them Once
your list of messages has been
compiled, ask your-sett it your
subordinate will be able to
remember all of the messages you
have chosen to deliver. If not, you

must

review, right? Wrong. When you are
using the worksheet, sometimes


you come up with a message that
will startle you. So what do you do?
You're faced with either delivering
the message or not, but if the
purpose of the review is to improve
your subordinate's performance,
you must deliver it. Preferably, a
review should not contain any
surprises, but if you uncover one,
swallow hard and bring it up.


On pages 200-201 you'll find an "on
the one hand, on the other hand"
kind of performance review. It was
written to correspond to the
worksheet shown opposite. I have
annotated it to call attention to
some of the things we discussed in
this chapter.


The Blast


With a little soul-searching, you
may come to realize that you have a
major performance problem on
your hands. You have a subordinate
who, unless turned around, could
get fired. To deal with the problem,
you and your subordinate will likely


go through stages commonly
experienced in problem-solving of
all kinds and particularly in conflict
resolution. These are shown on
page 194. You'll find these occurring
definitely during and possibly after
the "blast" review, which is basically
an exercise of resolving conflict
about a big performance problem.


A poor performer has a strong
tendency to ignore his problem.
Here a manager needs facts and
examples so that he can
demonstrate its reality. Progress of
some sort is made when the
subordinate actively denies the
existence of a problem rather than


ignoring it passively, as before.
Evidence can overcome resistance
here as well, and we enter the third
stage, when the subordinate admits
that there is a problem, but
maintains it is not his problem.
Instead he will blame others, a
standard defense mechanism. Using
this defense, he can continue to
avoid the responsibility and burden
of remedying the situation.


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


Find solution


Assume responsibility


Blame others


Denv


Ignore


The stages of problem-solving: The
transition from blaming others to
assuming responsibility is an
emotional step.


These three steps usually follow
one another in fairly rapid
succession. But things tend to get
stuck at the blame-others stage. If
your subordinate does have a
problem, there's no way of resolving
it if he continues to blame it on


others. He has to take the biggest
step: namely assuming
responsibility. He has to say not
only that there is a problem but that
it is his problem. This is fateful,
because it means work: "If it is my
problem, I have to do something
about it. If I have to do something,
it is likely to be unpleasant and will
definitely mean a lot of work on my
part." Once responsibility has been
assumed, however, finding the
solution is relatively easy. This is
because the move from blaming
others to assuming responsibility
constitutes an emotional step, while
the move from assuming


responsibility to finding the
solution is an intellectual one, and
the latter is easier.


It is the reviewer's job to get the
subordinate to move through all of
the stages to that of assuming
responsibility, though finding the
solution should be a shared task.


The supervisor should keep track of
what stage things are in. If the
supervisor wants to go on to find
the solution when the subordinate
is still denying or blaming others,
nothing can happen. Knowing
where you are will help you both
move through the stages together.


In the end, there are three possible
outcomes, One 5 the subordinate
accepts your assessment and your
recommended cure, and commits
himself to take it. Two, he may
disagree completely with your
assessment but still accepts your
cure. Three, the subordinate
disagrees with your assessment and
does not commit himself to do w r
hat you've recommended. As the
supervisor, which of these three
should you consider acceptable
resolutions to the problem?


I feel very strongly that any
outcome that includes a
commitment to action is acceptable.


Complex issues do not lend
themselves easily to universal
agreement. If your subordinate says
he's committed to change things,
you have to assume he's sincere.
The key word here is accept-able. It
is certainly more desirable for you
and your subordinate to agree about
the problem and the solution,
because that will make you feel that
he will enthusiastically work toward
remedying it. So up to a point you
should try to get your subordinate
to agree with you. But if you can't,
accept his commitment to change
and go on. Don't confuse emotional
comfort with operational need. To


make things work, people do not
need to side with you; you only
need them to commit themselves to
pursue a course of action that has
been decided upon. There seems to
be something not quite nice about
expecting a person to walk down a
path he'd rather not be on. But on
the job we are after a person's
performance, not our psychological
comfort.


I learned the distinction between
the two during one of the first
reviews I had to give, I was trying
very hard to persuade my
subordinate to see things my way.
He simply would not go along with


me and finally said to me, "Andy,


you will never convince me, but
why do you insist on wanting to
convince me? I've already said I will
do what you say." I shut up,
embarrassed, not knowing why. It
took me a long time before I
realized I was embarrassed because
my insistence had a lot to do with
making me feel better and litde to
do with the running of the business.


If it becomes clear that you are not
going to get your subordinate past
the blame-others stage, you will
have to assume the formal role of
the supervisor, endowed with


position power, and say, "This is
what I, as your boss, am instructing
you to do. I understand that you do
not see it my way. You may be right
or I may be right. But I am not only
empowered, I am required by the
organization for which we both
work to give you instructions, and
this is what I want you to do ..." And
proceed to secure your
subordinate's commitment to the
course of action you want and
thereafter monitor his performance
against that commitment.


Recently one of my subordinates
wrote a review that I considered
superficial, lacking analysis and


depth. My subordinate, after some
discussion, agreed with my
assessment, but he considered the
issue not important enough, as he
put it, to spend time rewriting the
review. After more spirited
discussion, we remained
deadlocked. Finally, I took a deep
breath and said to him, "Look, I
understand that you don't consider
it worth your time to do it. But I
want you to do it." I added that "I
guess there is a basic difference
between us. The integrity of the
performance review system is just
more important to me than it is to
you. That is why I have to insist."


He looked back at me and after a
moment simply said, "Okay." He
thought I was out in left field and
resented the fact that I made him
spend time on something he
thought was unimportant, but he
committed himself to redo the
review, and, in fact, he did it well.
His subordinate ended up getting
the reworked, much more thorough
and thoughtful review, and the fact
that his review was rewritten


without the agreement of my
subordinate made no difference to

him.


Reviewing the Ace


After trying to establish the
principles of performance appraisal
with a group of about twenty
middle managers, I asked them to
take a review they had once
received and to analyze it according
to our new criteria. The results were
not what I expected, but I did learn
from them.


This group consisted of achievers,
and their ratings were mostly very
high. The reviews were
exceptionally well written, much
better than the average at Intel.
However, for content, they tended
to be retrospective assessments,
analyses of what the subordinate


had done in the course of the prior
year. Even though their key purpose
was to improve the subordinate's
future performance, a majority of
the reviews made little or no
attempt to define what the
subordinate needed to do to
improve his performance or even to
maintain his current level. It seems
that for an achiever the supervisor's
effort goes into determining and
justifying the judgment of the
superior performance, while giving
little attention to how he could do
even better. But for a poor
performer, the supervisor tends to
concentrate heavily on ways he can


improve performance, providing
detailed and elaborate "corrective
action programs," step-by-step
affairs meant to ensure that the
marginal employee can pull himself
up to meet minimum requirements.


I think we have our priorities
reversed. Shouldn't we spend more
time trying to improve the
performance of our stars? After all,
these people account for a
disproportionately large share of
the work in any organization. Put
another way, concentrating on the
stars is a high-leverage activity: if
they get better, the impact on group
output is very great indeed.


We all have a hard time savins:
things that are critical,


whether we're talking to a superior
employee or a marginal one. We
must keep in mind, however, that
no matter how stellar a person's
performance level is, there is always
room for improvement. Don't
hesitate to use the 20/20 hindsight
provided by the review to show
anyone, even an ace, how he might
have done better.


Other Thoughts and Practices


Is it a good idea to ask the
subordinate to prepare some kind


of a self-review before being
reviewed by his supervisor? Let me
answer the question this way. Your
own review is obviously important
to you, and you really want to know
how your supervisor sees your
year's work. If you prepare a review
and give it to your supervisor, and
he simply changes the format,
retypes it, gives you a superior
rating, and then hands it back to
you, how will you feel? Probably
cheated. If you have to tell your
supervisor about your
accomplishments, he obviously
doesn't pay much attention to what
you are doing. Reviewing the


performance of subordinates is a
formal act of leadership. If
supervisors permit themselves to be
prompted in one way or another,
their leadership and their capacity
for it will begin to appear false. So
the integrity of the
supervisors'judgment here must be
preserved at all costs, and they
must commit themselves through
an up-front judgment of their
subordinates' performance if the
health and vitality of the review
process are to be maintained.


What about asking your
subordinate to evaluate your
performance as his supervisor? I


think this might be a good idea. But
you should make it clear to your
subordinate that it's your job to
assess his performance, while his
assessment of you has only
advisory status. The point is, he is
not your leader; you are his. And
under no circumstances should you
pretend that you and your
subordinates are equal during
performance reviews.


Should you deliver the written
review before, during, or after the
face-to-face discussion? I have tried
it all three ways. Let's consider
some of the pros and cons of each.
What happens if you have the


review first and then give your
subordinate what you've written
later? Upon reading it, the
subordinate may find a phrase that
he didn't "hear" earlier and blow up
over it. What about delivering the
written review during the
discussion? One manager told me
that he gives the subordinate a copy
of the review and tells him to read
the first several paragraphs, which
they then discuss. Grouping the
paragraphs, supervisor and
subordinate work their way through
the appraisal. I can see a problem
with this. How can a supervisor ask
a subordinate to stop at paragraph


three when he is so eager to read
the rest of what he's got? Another
manager told me that he reads the
written review to his subordinate to
try to control the session. But here,
too, the subordinate is left eager to
know what comes next and might
not pay attention to what is really
being said. Also, when your
subordinate is given a written
review during the discussion, he
won't have the time to think about
what it says and is likely to walk
away muttering to himself, "I
should have said this in response,
and I should have said that." For a
good meeting of minds, your


subordinate should have time to

work out his reactions to what's in
the review 7 .


In my experience, the best thing to
do is to give your subordinate the
written review sometime before the

face-to-face discussion. He can then
read the whole thing privately and
digest it. He can react or overreact
and then look at the "messages"
again. By the time the two of you
get together, he will be much more
prepared, both emotionally and
rationally*


Preparing and delivering a
performance assessment is one of


the hardest tasks you'll have to
perform as a manager. The best way
to learn how to do one is to think
critically about the reviews you
yourself have received.

John transferred to Materials
Support in early February. The
production planning process was in
some difficulties at the time he
joined the group. jfc>hn got up to
speed very quickly and was able to
take over the job from his
predecessor very effectively


In the manufacturing specifications
area, John's efforts have been far
less successful to date. John puts
effort Into these areas, but the
results have not been satisfactory I
think that the problem has two

causes.


-John has a hard time defining
clear, concise, and specific goals. A
clear example of this is his difficulty
setting good objectives


^ and key results. Another example
is the mushy conclusion of the
manufacturing specification system
review in March. We still don't have

a clear definitive statement of


where the spec system is heading
and how it is going to get there.
Without specific goals, one can very
easily fall into the trap of "working
orf* things without reaching the
objectives-which leads to the
second issue.


-I feel that John is easily satisfied
that having a meeting on a


- subject constitutes progress. This
happened, for example^n the


area of training associated with
manufacturing specs. John


Compliments need examples, too.' "

specific results he wants to
accomplish with it.


lohn's prior finance background has
really helped in a variety of work
areas. For example, John
voluntarily helped the Purchasing
'group sort out some of their
finance problems-an effort over and


above the call of duty.


John would like to be promoted to
the next management level. This
will not happen at this time, but I
am satisfied that his capabilities
will allow him to eventually be
promoted. Before that happens,
however, John has to be able to
take complex projects, like the
manufacturing spec system, and
show re s u l ts. This will require
clear and concise breakdown of
problems, identification of goals,
and establishment of the way to
achieve those goals. John, 'for the
most part, will have to achieve this
on his own. While I will help when


needed, John has to be the primary
driver. Only when he shows that he
is capable of independent work
along these lines can he be
promoted.


In summarv, John is capable of
doing his current job. I also realiyx
the difficulty John has had in
changing from the finance
environment to a manufacturing
environment. I will continue to try
to help him-particularly in the areas
of goal setting and defining ways of
accomplishing his tasks. John's
performance in Materials Support is
rated as "meets requirements"-a
rating he should definitely be able


to improve.

has helped to maintain the integrity
of the system in your company.
Nevertheless, people constantly
need to be prodded into doing a


good job of reviewing. Each year I
read something like a hundred
evaluations, all of those written by
my own subordinates and a random
selection from throughout Intel. I
comment on them and send them

back for rewrites or with a
complimentary note. I do this with
as much noise and visibility as I
can, because I want to reiterate and
reaffirm the significance the system
has and should have for every Intel
employee* Anything less would not

important kind of task-relevant
feedback we can give our
subordinates.

Two Difficult Tasks


There are two other emotionally
charged tasks a manager must
perform. They are interviewing a
potential employee and trying to
talk a valued employee out of
quitting.


Interviewing


The purpose of the interview is to:


- select a good performer


- educate him as to who you and the


company are


- determine if a mutual match

exists


- sell him on the job


The means at your disposal
typically consist of an hour or two
of interview time and a check of the

candidate's references. We know

how hard it is to assess the actual
past performance of our own
subordinates even though we spent
much time working closely with
them. Here we sit somebody down
and try to find out in an hour how
well he is likely to perform in an


entirely new environment. If
performance appraisal is difficult,
interviewing is just about
impossible. The fact is, we
managers have no choice but to
perform the interview, no matter
how


hard it is. But we must realize that
the risks of failure are high.


J^ 16 other to ° l we have for
assessing potential performance is
to research past performance bv
cherkina references. But you'll
often be talking to a total stranger,
so even if he comments freely about
the candidate, what he says won't


have much meaning to you without
some knowledge of how his
company does business and what
values it works by. Moreover, while
few references will out-and-out lie,
they tend not to volunteer specific
critical remarks. So referencechecking hardly exempts you from
getting as much as you can out of
the interview.


CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW


The applicant should do 80 percent
of the talking durintr the interview,
and what he talks about should be
your main concern. But you have a
great deal of control here by being


an active listener. Keep in mind you
only have an hour or so to listen.
When you ask a question, a
garrulous or nervous person might
go on and on with his answer long
after you've lost interest. Most of us
will sit and listen until the end out
of courtesv. Instead, vou should
interrupt and stop him, because if
you don't, you are wasting your only
asset—the interview time, in which
you have to get as much
information and insight as possiDie. bo when things go off the track,
get them back on quickly. Apologize
if you like, and sav, "I would like to
change the subject to X, Y, or Z."


The interview is yours to control,
and if you don't, you have only
yourself to blame.


An interview produces the most
insight if you steer the discussion
toward subjects familiar to both you
and the candidate. The person
should talk about himself, his
experience, what he has done and
whv. what hp woulH have done
differently if he had it to do over,
and so forth but this should be done
in terms familiar to you, so that


you can evaluate its significance. In
short, make sure the words used
mean the same thing to both of you.


What are the subjects that you
should bring up during an
interview? A group of managers
provided me with what they
thought were the best questions.
They were:


— Describe some projects that were
highly regarded by your
management, especially by the
levels above your immediate
supervisor.


— What are your weaknesses? How
are you working to eliminate them?


— Convince me why my company
should hire you.


— What are some of the problems
you are encountering in your
current position? How are you
going about solving them? What
could you have done to prevent
them from cropping up?


— Why do you think you're ready
for this new job?


— What do you consider your most
significant achievements? Why
were they important to you?


— What do you consider your most
significant failures? What did you
leam from them?


— Why do you think an engineer
should be chosen for a marketing
position? (Vary this one according
to the situation.)


— What was the most important
course or project you completed in
your college career? Why was it so
important?


The information to be gained here
tends to fall into four distinct
categories. First, you're after an
understanding of the candidate's
technical knowledge: not
engineering or scientific knowledge,
but what he knows about
performing the job he wants—his


skill level. For an accountant,
technical skill means an
understanding of accounting; for a
tax lawyer, tax laws; for an actuary,
statistics and the use of actuarial
tables; and so on. Second, you're
trying to assess how this person
performed in an earlier job using
his skills and technical knowledge;


in short, not just what the candidate
knows, but also what he did with
what he knows. Third, you are after
the reasons why there may be any
discrepancy between what he knew
and what he did, between his
capabilities and his performance.
And finally, you are trying to get a


feel for his set of operational
values, those that would guide him
on the job.


Let's look at how the questions
above fit into the four categories.


Technical/'Skills describe some
projects what are your weaknesses


What He Did With Knowledge past
achievements past failures


Discrepancies


what did you learn from failures


problems in current position


Operational Values


why are you ready for new job


why should my company hire you


why should engineer be chosen for
marketing


most important college
course/project


The ultimate purpose of
interviewing is to make a judgment
about how the candidate would
perform in your company's
environment. This is at odds with a
principle we stressed about


performance reviews: the need to
avoid the "potential" trap. But when
you're hiring, you must judge
potential contribution. Within the
hour or so at your disposal, you
must move between the world of
the past employer and your own,
and project the candidate's future
performance in a new environment
based


on his own description of past
performance. This managerial task
is clearly tricky and high-risk, but
unfortunately unavoidable.


You can't get away from relying on a
candidate's self-assessment. But


that's not a bad way to get direct
answers to direct questions. If, for
example, you were to ask, "How
good are you technically?" the
interviewee might be taken back
momentarily but then clear his
throat and say timidly, "Well, I
think I'm pretty good ..." As you
listen, you'll probably get a decent
fix on how capable he really is.
Don't worry about being blunt;
direct questions tend to bring direct
answers, and when they don't, they
produce other forms of insight into
the candidate.


Asking a candidate to handle a
hypothetical situation can also


enlighten you. I once interviewed
someone for the position of cost
accountant at Intel. He had a

Harvard MBA and came from the
food service industry. He knew
nothing about the semiconductor
business and I knew nothing about
finance, so we really couldn't talk in
much detail about his technical
ability to do the job. I decided to
take him through the
semiconductor manufacturing
process step by step. After saying I
would answer any specific
questions he had, I asked him what
the finished cost of a wafer would
be. He asked some questions and


pondered matters for a while. He
then started to think his way
through the basic semiconductor
cost accounting principles,
discovering some of them as he
went along, and ultimately came up
with the correct answer. He was
hired, because this exercise
demonstrated (as it turns out,
correctly) that his problem-solving
capacity was first-rate.


Another approach follows that you
may want to use while interviewing.
The candidate can tell you a great
deal about his capabilities, skills,
and values by asking you questions.
Ask the candidate what he would


like to know


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


about you, the company, or the job.
The questions he asks will tell you
what he already knows about the
company, what he would like to
know more about, and how well
prepared he is for the interview.
There's nothing foolproof about
this, however. Once a prospective
man" ager came to my omce with a
copy of our annual report, which he
had read very carefully and marked
up with penetrating questions. In
fact, I couldn't answer many of
them. I was very impressed. We


hired him and he failed badly on the
job. As I said, interviewing is a highrisk proposition . . .


A final point about references:
when you are talking to them,
you're really after the same
information that you tried to get
directly from the candidate. If you
know the reference personally, you
have a much better chance of
getting "real" information. If you
don't, try to keep him on the phone
long enough to let some sort of
personal bond develop. If you can
uncover some common experience
or association, the reference will
probably become more open with


you. In my experience, the last ten
minutes of a half-hour conversation

are much more valuable than the
first ten minutes, thanks to that
bond.


If possible, you should talk with the
applicant again after you have
checked his references, because you
may have gotten some new
perspectives. Such a follow-up
interview can be quite a focused
affair.


What about "tricks"? The best ones

I've heard about come to me from
somebody who had tried to get into
the Navy's nuclear submarine


program. Admiral Rickover
apparendy personally interviewed
each candidate and employed
techniques like having the
candidate sit on a three-legged
chair. When it tipped over, the poor
man would be left sprawling on the
floor. Rickover evidently thought
the trick tested strength of
character in the face of

embarrassment. But I think the
interview should be completely
straightforward. Remember, a
candidate is a potential employee.
He will go away from having talked


to you with a strong set of first
impressions. If those are wrong and


you hire the person, it will take a
long time before they change. So
show yourself and your
environment as they really are.


Are there any guarantees of
success? Several years ago I
interviewed a person for a highlevel position at Intel. I did the
work as carefully and thoroughly as
I could. 1 had a very good feel, I
thought, of the whys and
wherefores of the person's skills,
past performance, and values, and
we hired him. From day one he was
a disaster. Much humbled, I've
since gone over my notes from the
interviews and the conversations


with references. To this day I
haven't a clue about why I didn't
spot the candidate's considerable
flaws. So in the end careful
interviewing doesn't guarantee you
anything, it merely increases your
odds of getting lucky.


*7 Quit!"


This is what I most dread as a
manager: a subordinate, highly
valued and esteemed, decides to
quit. I am talking not about
someone whose motives are more
money and better perks at another
company, but about an employee
who is dedicated and loyal yet feels


his work is not appreciated. You and
the company don't want to lose
him, and his decision to leave
reflects on you. If he feels his
efforts have gone unrecognized, you
have not done your job and have
failed as his manager.


The opening shot usually occurs
when you are on the run. On your
way to what you consider an
important meeting, your
subordinate timidly stops you and
mutters under his breath, "Do you
have a minute?" He then mutters

further that he has decided to leave
the company. You look at him wideeyed. Your initial reaction to his


announcement is absolutely crucial.
If you're human, you'll probably
want to escape to your meeting, and
you mumble something back about
talking things over later. But


in almost all such cases, the
employee is quitting because he
feels he is not important to you. If
you do not deal with the situation
right at the first mention, you'll
confirm his feelings and the
outcome is inevitable.


Drop what you are doing. Sit him
down and ask him why he is
quitting. Let him talk—don't argue
about anything with him. Believe


me, he's rehearsed his speech
countless times during more than
one sleepless night. After he's
finished going through all his
reasons for wanting to leave (they
won't be good ones), ask him more
questions. Make him talk, because
after the prepared points are
delivered, the real issues may come
out. Don't argue, don't lecture, and
don't panic. Remember, this is only
the opening skirmish, not the war.
And you cannot win the war here—
but you can lose it! You have to
convey to him by what you do that
he is important to you, and you
have to find out what is really


troubling him. Don't try to change
his mind at this point, but buy time.
After he's said all he has to say, ask
for whatever time you feel is
necessary to prepare yourself for
the next round. But know that you
must follow through on whatever
you've committed yourself to do.


What's your next move? Because
you have a major problem, you go
to your supervisor for help and
advice. He no doubt is also on his
way to an important meeting . . .
He, like you, will try to put things
off, and most probably not because
he doesn't care, but because the
situation affects you more than


your supervisor—after all, it is your
subordinate who has decided to
quit. It is up to you to make it your
supervisor's problem and make him
participate in the solution to your
problem.


Corporate citizenship will probably
play a substantial role in what
happens next. Your subordinate is a
valued employee—of the company.
You now must vigorously pursue
every avenue available to you to
keep him with the firm, even if it
means transferring him to another
department. If it seems that is the
likely solution, you


must become the project manager
of that solution until the whole
thing is settled. You may ask why
you should put yourself out to keep
an employee whom you are going to
lose. There is a basic principle
involved: you owe it to your
employer to save an employee for
the company. Beyond this, the
golden rule can become more than
a nice ideal in situations of this
sort. Today you save a valued
contributor for the company by
virtually giving him to a fellow
manager. Tomorrow it will be his
turn to do you the same favor. In
the long run, if all managers take


this position, they will all win.


Nov/ you may be ready to go back
to your subordinate with a solution,
one that addresses his real reasons
for wanting to quit and one that in
turn will benefit the company. By
now he should know that he is
important to you, but he might say
that you should have offered him
the new position long ago. He might
go on to say that you're only doing
it now because he forced you into it
? his feeling being that "If I stay,
you'll think of me as the
blackmailer forever!"


You now have to make him feel


comfortable with the new
arrangement. You might say
something like, "You did not
blackmail us into doing anything we
shouldn't have done anyway. When
you almost quit, you shook us up
and made us aware of the error of
our ways. We are just doing what
we should have done without any of
this happening."


Then your subordinate may say he's
accepted a job somewhere else and
can't back out. You have to make
him quit again. You say he's really
made two commitments: first to a
potential employer he only vaguely
knows, and second to you, his


present employer. And
commitments he has made to the
people he has been working with
daily are far stronger than one
made to a casual new acquaintance.


As I said, the whole thing is not
easy, either for the subordinate or
the supervisor. But you must give it

your


best shot, because the good of the
company is involved and the issue
is even more important than
keeping one valued employee. This
subordinate is valuable and
important because he has attributes
that make him so. Other employees


respect him; and if they are like
him, they identify with him. So
other superior performers like him
will track what happens to him, and
their morale and commitment to
the company will hinge on the
outcome of this person's fate.


Compensation as Task-Relevant
Feedback


Money has significance at all levels
of Maslow's motivation hierarchy.
As noted earlier, a person needs
money to buy food, housing, and
insurance policies, which are part of
his physiological and
safety/security needs. As one moves


up the need hierarchy, money
begins to mean something else—a
measure of one's worth in a
competitive environment. Earlier I
described a simple test that can be
applied to determine the role
money plays for someone. If the
absolute amount of a raise in salary
is important, that person is
probably motivated by physiological
or safety/security needs. If the
relative amount of a raise—what he
got compared to others—is the
important issue, that person is
likely to be motivated by selfactualization, because money here
is a measure, not a necessity.


At higher levels of compensation,
an incremental amount of money
gradually will have less and less
material utility to the person who
gets it. In my experience, middle
managers are usually paid well
enough that money does not have
crucial material significance to
them, but not well enough that it is
without any material significance.
Of course, one middle manager's
needs can differ gready from
another's, depending on individual


circumstances—number of children,
a working spouse or not, and so on.
As a supervisor, you have to be very
sensitive toward the various money


needs of your subordinates and
show empathy toward them. You
must be especially careful not to
project your own circumstances
onto others.


As managers, our concern is to get a
high level of performance from our
subordinates. So we want to
dispense, allocate, and use money
as a way to deliver task-relevant
feedback To do this, compensation
should obviously be tied to
performance, but that, as we've
seen, is very hard to assess
precisely. Because a middle
manager cannot be paid by the
piece, his job can never be defined


by simple output. And because his
performance is woven into the
performance of a team, it is hard to
design a compensation scheme tied
directly to the individual
performance of a middle manager.


But compromises can be set up. We
can base a portion of a middle
manager's compensation on his
performance. Let's call this a
performance bonus. The percentage
the bonus represents of a manager's
total compensation should rise with
his total compensation. Thus, for a
highly paid senior manager, for
whom the absolute dollars make
relatively little difference, the


performance bonus should be as
high as 50 percent, while a middle
manager should receive more in the
range of 10 to 25 percent of his total
compensation this way. Even
though what he makes is typically
at a level where substantial
fluctuations could cause personal
hardship, we can at least give a taste
of task-relevant feedback.


To design a good performance
bonus scheme, we must deal with a
variety of issues. We need to figure
out if the performance is linked to a
team or if it is mostly related to
individual work. If it is the former,
who makes up the team? Is it a


project team, a division, or the
entire corporation? We also need to
figure out what period the
performance bonus should cover,
realizing again that


cause and effect tend to be offset
from each other, often by a long
time, but a bonus needs to be paid
close enough to the time the work
was done that the subordinate can
remember why it was awarded.
Furthermore, we must think about
whether the bonus should be based
strictly on countable items
(financial performance, for
example), on achieving measurable
objectives, or on some subjective


elements that might get us drawn
into a beauty contest. Finally, of
course, we don't want to devise
something that pays out lavishly
even as the company is going
bankrupt.


If you take all of this into account,
you are likely to come up with some
complex arrangements. For
example, you might have a scheme
in which a manager's performance
bonus is based on three factors. The

first would include his individual
performance only, as judged by his
supervisor. The second would
account for his immediate team's
objective performance, his


department perhaps. The third
factor would be linked to the overall
financial performance of the
corporation. When you take, let's
say, 20 percent of a manager's
compensation and split it into three
parts, any one will have only a small
impact on total compensation, yet
attention will still be called to its
significance. No matter what way
you choose to determine bonuses,
none gives you exactly what you
want, but most of them will
spotlight performance and deliver
task-relevant feedback.


Let's now look at the administration
of base salaries. In the abstract,


there are two ways to do it. At one
extreme, the dollar level is
determined by experience only; at
the other, by merit alone. In the
experience-only approach, an
employee's salary increases with
the time he has spent in a particular
position. A key point here is that
any job has a maximum value; no
matter how long an individual has
been in it, his salary ultimately has
to level off, as shown in the figure
on the next page. In the merit-only
approach, salary is independent of
the time


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


spent in the job. Here the theory
says, "I don't care if you are one
year out of college or have spent
twenty years in the work force. I
only care to see how you perform in
this


Maximum


Performance


Time A. Experience only


Time B. Merit only


Time C. Compromise


There are two pure forms of salary
administration; most companies
use a compromise.


job." But here too, of course, a given
job still has a maximum value.
Social norms can force us into some
unfortunate compensation
practices. For instance, even though
we say that every job has a finite
value where compensation should
level off, we often let an individual


become too highly paid because we,
management, keep giving routine
raises.


Many organizations practice a pure
experience-only form of salary
administration. Large Japanese
companies tend to place no
distinction based on performance
during the first ten or so years of
employment—which are probably
the most productive years of a
professional's life. Likewise, unions
and most government jobs lean
toward pure experience-only salary
scales. Apart from whether this is
fair or not, the message frorn
management is that performance


doesn't matter much. Consider
teachers in many school systems. A
good one gets paid the same salary
as a bad one if they both have been
around for the same length of time.
How a teacher is


evaluated is not usually tied even
symbolically to compensation,
which makes me wonder if the
pass/fail system of grading did not
have its origin in the way the typical
teacher is paid.


At the same time, merit-only salary
administration is impractical in its
pure form. It is very hard to ignore
a person's experience as you try to


pay a fair salary. Thus, most
companies choose a course between
the two extremes, which is a
compromise scheme that takes the
shape of a family of curves shown
in the previous figure. The shapes
of all of them approximate the
curve representing the experienceonly approach, but as you can see,
while people start at the same
salary level, they move up at
different speeds and arrive at
different places, depending upon
individual performance.


Of the three schemes, the one based
on experience only is obviously the
easiest to administer. If your


subordinate does not like the raise
he's been given, all you have to do is
show him the book where it says
that for X amount of time on the
job he deserves and gets Y amount
of pay. A supervisor trying to
administer some type of meritbased or compromise scheme has to
deal with the allocation of a finite
resource—money—and this requires
thought and effort. If we want to
use such schemes, we have to come
to terms with the principle—
troubling to many managers—that
any merit-based system requires a
competitive, comparative
evaluation of individuals.


Merit-based compensation simply
cannot work unless we understand
that if someone is going to be first,
somebody else has to be last. As
Americans, we have no problem
accepting a competitive ranking in a
sports event. Even the person who
comes in last in a race feels
comfortable about the system that
says someone has to finish last. But
at work, unfortunately, competitive
ranking frequently becomes a
highly charged issue, difficult to
accept and to administer—yet it is a
must if


we want to use salary as a way to
encourage performance.


Promotions, denned as a
substantial change in a person's job,
are very important to the health of
any organization and should be
considered with great care.
Obviously, for the individual
concerned, promotions often
produce a big raise. As we have
seen, promotions are also readily
seen by other members of the
organization, and so take on a
vitally important role in
communicating a value system to
the rest of the company.
Promotions must be based on
performance, because that is the
only way to keep the idea of


performance highlighted,
maintained, and perpetuated.


If we are going to consider
promotions, we have to consider
the Peter Principle, which says that
when someone is good at his job, he
is promoted; he keeps getting
promoted until he reaches his level
of incompetence and then stays
there. Like all good caricatures, this
one captures at least some of what
really happens in a merit-based
promotion system.


Take a look at the illustration
opposite, where we track someone's
promotions. At point A the


demands of Job i so tax him that he
can only perform in an average
fashion. In the jargon of
performance assessment, he "meets
the requirements" of the job. As
time passes, he receives more
training and becomes more
motivated, and improves his
performance to an above-average
level, or, again in the jargon, to a
point where he "exceeds the
requirements" of the position. At
this time we consider the person
promotable, and in fact do promote
him to Job 2, where he will at first
perform only at a "meets
requirements" level. With more


experience, he again will"exceed the
requirements" of thejob.
Eventually, he probably gets
promoted again and the cycle
repeats itself. Thus, an achiever will
alternate between the "meets
requirements" and the "exceeds
requirements" ratings throughout
his career, until he eventually
settles at°a

his career.


"meets requirements" level, at
which time he will no longer be
promoted. This, perhaps, is a better
description of how the Peter
Principle works.


Now, is there an alternative to this?


I say there is not. If we take a
person at point B and don't offer
him more work and greater
challenges even though he "exceeds
the requirements" of Job 1, we are
not fully utilizing a human resource
of the company. In time, he will
atrophy, and his performance will
return to a "meets requirements"
level and stay there.


Thus, you'll find two basic types of
"meets" performers. One has no
motivation to do more or faces no
challenge to do more. This is the
noncompetitor, who has become
settled and satisfied in his job. The
other type of "meets" performer is


the competitor. Each time he
reaches a level of "exceeds
requirements," he becomes a
candidate for promotion. Upon
being promoted, he very likely
becomes a "meets" performer again.
This is the person Dr. Peter wrote
about. But we really have no


choice but to promote until a level
of "incompetence" is reached. At
least this way we drive our
subordinates toward higher
performance, and while they may
perform at a "meets" level half the
time, they will do that at an
increasingly more challenging and
difficult job level-There are times


when a person is promoted into a
position so much over his head that
he performs in a below-average
fashion for too long a time. The
solution is to recycle him: to put
him back into the job he did well
before he was promoted.
Unfortunately, this is a very
difficult thing to do in our society.
People tend to view it as a personal
failure. In fact, management was at
fault for misjudging the employee's
readiness for more responsibility.
Usually the person who was
promoted beyond his capability is
forced to leave the company rather
than encouraged to take a step back.


This is often rationalized by the
notion that "It is better that we let
him go, for his own sake." I think it
is dead wrong to force someone in
such circumstances out of the
company. Instead, I think
management ought to face up to its
own error in judgment and take
forthright and deliberate steps to
place the person into a job he can
do. Management should also
support the employee in the face of
the embarrassment that he is likely
to feel. If recycling is done openly,
all will be pleasantly surprised how
short-lived that embarrassment will
be. And the result will be a person


doing work we know from past
experience he can perform well. In
my experience, such people, once
they regain their confidence, will be
excellent candidates for another
promotion at a later time—and the
second time they are likely to
succeed.


In sum, we managers must be
responsible and provide our
subordinates with honest
performance ratings and honest
merit-based compensation. If we
do, the eventual result will be
performance valued for its own
sake throughout our organization.
