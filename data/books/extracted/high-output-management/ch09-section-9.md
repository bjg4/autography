the product? The point is that how
much an engineer is worth in a
group cannot be pinned down by
appealing to the free market. In
fact, if we bought engineering work
by the "bit," I think we would end
up spending more time trying to
decide the value of each bit of

contribution than the contribution
itself is worth. Here trying to use
free-market concepts becomes quite
inefficient.


So you say to the engineers, "Okay,
I'll retain your services for a year
for a set amount of money, and you
will agree to do a certain type of
work in return. We've now entered


into a contract. I'll give you an
office and a terminal, and you
promise me to do the best you can
to perform your task."


The nature of control is now based
on contractual obligations, which
define the kind of work you will do
and the standards that will govern
it. Because I can't specify in advance
exactly what you will do from day to
day, I must have a fair amount of
generalized authority over your
work. So you must give to me as
part of the contract the right to
monitor and evaluate and, if
necessary, correct your work. We
agree on other guidelines and work


out rules that we will both obey.


In return for stopping at a red light,
we count on other drivers to do the
same thing, and we can drive
through green lights. But for
lawbreakers we need policemen,
and with them, as with supervisors,
we introduce overhead.


What are some other examples of
contractual obligation? Take the tax
system. We surrender the right to
some of what we earn and expect
certain services in return. Giant
overhead is necessary to monitor
and audit our tax returns. A utility
company presents another example.


Its representatives will go to
somebody who works for the
government and say, "I'll build a
three-hundred-million-dollar
generating plant and provide
electricity for this portion of the
state if you promise me that no one
else will build one and try to sell
electricity here." The state says,
"Well, that's fine, but we're not
going to let you charge whatever
you want for the power you
generate. We'll establish a
monitoring agency called the Public
Utilities Commission and they'll tell
you how much you can charge
consumers and how much profit


you can make." So, in exchange for
a monopoly, the company is
contractually obliged to accept the
government's decision on pricing
and profit.


Cultural Values


When the environment changes
more rapidly than one can change
rules, or when a set of
circumstances is so ambiguous and
unclear that a contract between the
parties that attempted to cover all
possibilities would be prohibitively
complicated, we need another mode
of control, which is based on
cultural values. Its most important


characteristic is that the interest of
the larger group to which an
individual belongs takes precedence
over the interest of the individual

himself. When such values are at
work, some emotionally loaded
words come into play—words like
trust —because you are
surrendering to the group your
ability to protect yourself. And for
this to happen, you must believe
that you all share a common set of
values, a common set of objectives,
and a common set of methods.
These, in turn, can only be
developed by a great deal of
common, shared experience.


The Role of Management


Y ?- don l need mana gement to
supervise the workings of freemarket forces; no one supervises
sales made at a flea market. In a
contractual obligation, management
has a role in setting and modifying
the rules, monitoring adherence to
them, and evaluating and improving
performance. As for cultural
values,"management has to develop
and nurture the common set of
values, objectives, and methods
essential for the existence of trust.
How do we do that? One way is by
articulation, by spelling out these
values, objectives, and methods.


The other, even more important,
way is by example. If our behavior
at work will be regarded as in line
with the values we profess, that
fosters the development of a group
culture.


The Most Appropriate Mode of
Control


There is a temptation to idealize
what I've called cultural values as a

mode of control because it is so
"nice," even Utopian, because
everybody presumably cares about
the common good and subjugates
self-interest to that common good.
But this is not the most efficient


mode of control under all
conditions. It is no guide to buying
tires, nor could the tax system work
this way. Accordingly, given a
certain set of conditions, there is
always a most appropriate mode of
control, which we as managers
should find and use.


How do we do that? There are two
variables here: first, the nature of a
person's motivation; and second,
the nature of the environment in
which he works. An imaginary
composite index can be applied to
measure an environment's
complexity, uncertainty, and
ambiguity, which we'll call the CUA


factor. Cindy, the process engineer,
is surrounded by tricky
technologies," new and not fully
operational equipment, and
development engineers and
production engineers pulling her in

directions. Her working
environment, in short, is complex.
Bruce, the marketing manager, has
asked for permission to hire more
people for his grossly understaffed
group; his supervisor waffles, and
Bruce is left with no idea if he'll get
the go-ahead or what to do if he
doesn't. Bruce's working
environment is uncertain. Mike,
whom we will now introduce as an
Intel transportation supervisor, had
to deal with so many committees,
councils, and divisional


manufacturing managers that he
didn't know which, if any, end was
up. He eventually quit, unable to
tolerate the ambiguity of his
working environment.


Let's now conceive a simple chart
with four quadrants, shown above.
The individual motivation can run

from


»5° HIGH OUTPUT
MANAGEMENT


self-interest to group-interest, and
the CUA factor of a working
environment can vary from low to
high. Now look for the best mode of


control for each quadrant. When
self-interest is high and the CUA
factor is low, the most appropriate
is the market mode, which
governed our tire purchase. As
individual motivation moves toward
group interest, the contractual
mode becomes appropriate, which
governed our stopping for a red
light. When group-interest
orientation and the CUA factor are
both high, the cultural values mode
becomes the best choice, which
explains to us why we tried to help
at the scene of the accident. And
finally, when the CUA factor is high
and individual motivation is based


on self-interest, no mode of control
will work well. This situation, like
every man for himself on a sinking
ship, can only produce chaos.


Let's apply our model to the work of
a new employee. What is his
motivation? It is very much based
on self-interest. So you should give
him a clearly structured job with a
low CUA factor. If he does well, he
will begin to feel more at home,
worry less about himself, and start
to care more about his team. He

learns that if he is on a boat and
wants to get ahead, it is better for
him to help row than to run to the
bow. The employee can then be


promoted into a more complex,
uncertain, ambiguous job. (These
tend to pay more.) As time passes,
he will continue to gain an
increasing amount of shared
experience with other members of
the organization and will be ready
to tackle more and more complex,
ambiguous, and uncertain tasks.
This is why promotion from within
tends to be the approach favored by
corporations with strong corporate
cultures. Bring young people in at
relatively low-level, well-defined
jobs with low CUA factors, and over
time they will share experiences
with their peers, supervisors, and


subordinates and will learn the
values, objectives, and


methods of the organization. They
will gradually accept, even flourish
in, the complex world of multiple
bosses and peer decision-making.


But what do we do when for some

reason we have to hire a senior
person from outside the company?
Like any other new hire, he too will
come in having high self-interest,
but inevitably we will give him an
organization to manage that is in
trouble; after all, that was our
reason for going outside. So not
only does our new manager have a


tough job facing him, but his
working environment will have a
very high CUA. Meanwhile, he has
no base of common experience with
the rest of the organization and no
knowledge of the methods used to
help him work. All we can do is
cross our fingers and hope he
quickly forgets self-interest and just
as quickly gets on top of his job to
reduce his CUA factor. Short of that,
he's probably out of luck.


Modes of Control at Work


At any one time, one of the three
modes of control may govern what
we are doing. But from one day to


the next, we find ourselves
influenced by all three. Let's track
Bob's mode of control for a bit.
When Bob, a marketing supervisor,
buys his lunch in the cafeteria, he's
influenced by market forces. His
choices are well defined and based
on what he wants to buy and what
he wants to pay. Bob's coming to
work in the first place represents a
transaction governed by contractual
obligations. He is paid a set salary
for doing his best, which implies
that he has to show up. And his
willingness to participate in
strategic planning activities shows
cultural values at work. This is work


outside of his "regular" job as
defined contractually, and so
represents extra effort for him. But
he does it because he feels the
company needs what he has to
contribute.


Let's now consider what goes on
during the course of a work project.
As we know, Barbara's "department
is responsible for training the Intel
sales force in her division's
products. When she buys materials
used in the training program, freemarket forces reign as binders of
the required quality are purchased
at the lowest possible price. The
existence of the training program


itself, however, presents an
example of contractual obligations
at work. The salespeople expect that
each division will provide training
on a regular basis. While the
program isn't a mandated
requirement spelled out somewhere
in a formal policy statement, its
basis is nonetheless contractual.
The point is, expectations can be as
binding as a legal document.


When a number of divisions share a
common sales force, each of them
has a vested interest to train
representatives to promote and sell
its products. At the same time,
unless the divisions are willing to


sacrifice self-interest in favor of the
common interest, the training
sessions can easily become
disjointed free-for-alls and confuse
everybody, So the need to have the
individual divisions present
coordinated messages is governed
by corporate values. Thus, in field
sales training, we find all three
modes of control at work.


Recently a group of factory
marketing managers claimed that
our salespeople were governed only
by self-interest. They said that they
devoted most of their attention to
selling those items that produced
the most commissions and


bonuses. Irritated and a bit selfrighteous, the managers felt they
were much more concerned about
the common good of the company
than were their colleagues in the
field.


But the marketing departments
themselves created the monster. To
get the sales force to favor
particular products, the divisions
had for some time been running
contests, with prizes ranging from
cash bonuses to trips to exotic
places. The marketing managers
were compet

ing against one another for a finite


and valuable resource: the

salesmen's time. And the salesmen
merely responded as one might
expect-But salespeople can also
behave in the opposite fashion. At
one time, one of our divisions had
serious problems, leaving the sales
engineers with no product to sell
for nearly a year. They could have
left Intel and immediately gotten
other jobs and quick commissions
elsewhere, but by and large they
stayed with us. They stayed because
they believed in the company and
had faith that eventually things
would get better. Belief and faith
are not aspects of the market mode,


but stem from adherence to cultural

values.

The Sports Analogy


Earlier I built a case summed up by
the key sentence: A manager's
output is the output of the
organization under his supervision
or influence.


Put another way, this means that


management is a team activity. But
no matter how well a team is put
together, no matter how well it is
directed, the team will perform only
as well as the individuals on it. In
other w r ords, everything we've
considered so far is useless unless

the members of our team will
continually try to offer the best they
can do. The means a manager has at
his disposal to elicit peak individual
performance are what the rest of
this book is about.


When a person is not doing his job,
there can only be two reasons for it.
The person either can't do it or
won't do it; he is either not capable


or not motivated. To determine
which, we can employ a simple
mental test: if the person's life
depended on doing the work, could
he do it? If the answer is yes, that
person is not motivated; if the
answer is no, he is not capable. If
my life depended on playing the
violin on command, I could not do
it. But if I had to run a mile in six
minutes, I probably could. Not that
I would want to, but if my life
depended on it, I probably could.


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


The single most important task of a
manager is to elicit peak


performance from his subordinates.
So if two things limit high output, a
manager has two ways to tackle the
issue: through training and
motivation. Each, as we see in the
next figure, can improve a person's
performance. In this chapter, our
concern is motivation.


INDIVIDUAL CAPABILTTY


A manager has two ways to improve
performance: training and
motivation.


How does a manager motivate his
subordinates? For most of us, the
word implies doing something to


another person. But I don't think
that can happen, because
motivation has to come from within
somebody. Accordingly, all a
manager can do is create an
environment in which motivated
people can flourish.


Because better motivation means
better performance, not a change of
attitude or feeling, a subordinate's
saying "I feel motivated" means
nothing. What matters is if he


performs better or worse because
his environment changed. An
attitude may constitute an
indicator, a "window into the black


box" of human motivation, but it is
not the desired result or output.
Better performance at a given skill
level is.


For most of Western history,
including the early days of the
Industrial Revolution, motivation
was based mostly on fear of
punishment. In Dickens' time, the
threat of loss of life got people to
work, because if people did not
work, they were not paid and could
not buy food, and if they stole food
and got caught, they were hanged.
The fear of punishment indirectly
caused them to produce more than
they might have otherwise.


Over the past thirty years or so, a
number of new approaches have
begun to replace older practices
keyed to fear. Perhaps the
emergence of the new, humanistic
approaches to motivation can be
traced to the decline in the relative
importance of manual labor and the
corresponding rise in the
importance of so-called knowledge
workers. The output of a manual
laborer is readily measurable, and
departures from the expected can
be spotted and dealt with
immediately. But for a knowledge
worker, such departures take longer
to determine because even the


expectations themselves are very
difficult to state precisely. In other
words, fear won't work as well with
computer architects as with galley
slaves; hence, new approaches to
motivation are needed.


My description of what makes
people perform relies heavily on
Abraham Maslow's theory of
motivation, simply because my own
observations of working life
confirm Maslow's concepts. For
Maslow, motivation is closely tied
to the idea of needs, which cause
people to have drives, which in turn
result in motivation. A need once
satisfied stops being a need and


therefore stops being a source of
motivation. Simply put, if we are to
create and maintain a high degree
of motivation, we must keep some
needs unsatisfied at all times.


*6° HIGH OUTPUT

MANAGEMENT


People, of course, tend to have a
variety of concurrent needs, but one
among them is always stronger
than the others. And that need is
the one that largely determines an
individual's motivation and
therefore his level of performance.
Maslow defined a set of needs, as
shown below, that tend to lie in a


hierarchy: when a lower need is
satisfied, one higher is likely to take

over.


Maslow defined a set of needs that


tend to lie in a hierarchy: when a
lower need is satisfied, one higher
is likely to take


over.


Physiological Needs


These needs consist of things that
money can buy, like xoo^, ciotiniig,
and other basic necessities of life.

Fear is


hitched to such needs: one fears the
possible deprivation of food,
clothing, and so on.


Security /Safety Needs


These come from a desire to protect
oneself from slipping back to a state
of being deprived of the basic
necessities. Safety and security
needs are fulfilled, for example,
when medical insurance provides
employees protection against the
fear of going bankrupt trying to pay
doctor and hospital fees. The
existence of benefits is rarely a
dominant source of employee
motivation, but if benefits were
absent and employees had to worry
about such concerns, performance
would no doubt be badly affected,


Social/Affiliation Needs


The social needs stem from the
inherent desire of human beings to
belong to some group or other. But
people don't want to belong to just
any group; they need to belong to
one whose members possess
something in common with
themselves. For example, when
people are excited, confident, or
happy, they want to be around
people who are also excited,
confident, or happy. Conversely,
misery loves not just any company,
but the company of other miserable
people. Nobody who is miserable
wants to be around someone happy.


Social needs are quite powerful. A


friend of mine decided to go back to
work after many years of minding
her home. She took a low-paying
job, which did little for her family's
standard of living. For a long time, I
didn't understand why she did what
she did, but finally it dawned on
me: she needed the companionship
her work offered. Going to work
meant being around a group of
people she liked.


Another example of the power of
social needs is pro

vided by Jim, a young engineer. His
first job after he graduated from
college was with a very large, long

established company, while his two
college roommates came to work at
Intel. Because Jim continued to
room with them, he was exposed to
what working within Intel was like.
Moreover, most of his roommates'
friends from work were also young,
unmarried, and just a year or two
out of college, while most of the
people where Jim worked were
married and at least ten years older.
Jim felt left out, and his need for a
group in which he felt comfortable
prompted him to come to work at
Intel, though he very much enjoyed
his work at the other company. As
one's environment or condition in


life changes, one's desire to satisfy a
particular set of needs is replaced
by a desire to satisfy another set.
There's the story of a young Intel
manager, Chuck, when he was a
first-year student at the Harvard
Business School. Initially, he was
engulfed by a fear of the class
material, of his professors, of
failure, of flunking out. After a
while his fear gave way tu the
realization that everyone else was
in the same boat, also afraid.
Students began to form study
groups whose ostensible purpose
was to consider class material
together, but whose real purpose


was to strengthen confidence.
Chuck moved from being governed
largely bv his need for sheer
survival—a "physiological" need—
toone for security and safety. As
time went on, the studv ctouds
dissolved and the students started

to associate with other members of
the class. The entire class, or
"section." as it was called, developed
a definite and recognizable set of
characteristics; it became, in short,
a team. Members enjoyed
belonging, associating, and
identifying with it, and worked to
sustain the section's image amone
the professors and other students.


Chuck was now satisfying his need
for affiliation.


Of course, regressive movement is
also possible. Recently, a highly
motivated, smoothly working team
of manufacturing employees in one
of our California plants


was suddenly jolted—all too literally
—from satisfying a very high level
of human needs to abandoning an
inventory of silicon wafers,
expensive manufacturing
equipment, even friends. An
earthquake shook their factory.
People feared for their lives,
dropped everything, and ran to the


nearest exit as they found
themselves totally consumed by the
most fundamental of all
physiological needs—survival.


The physiological, safety/security,
and social needs all can motivate us
to show up for work, but other
needs— esteem and selfactualization—make us perform
once we are there.


Esteem/Recognition Needs


The need for esteem or recognition
is readily apparent in the cliche
"keeping up with the Joneses." Such
striving is commonly frowned upon,


but if an athlete's "Jones" is last
year's Olympic gold medalist, or if
an actor's "Jones" is Laurence
Olivier, the need to keep up with or
emulate someone is a powerful
source of positive motivation. The
person or group whose recognition
you desire may mean nothing to
someone else—esteem exists in the
eyes of the beholder. If you are an
aspiring high school athlete and one
of the top players passes you in the
hall and says hello, you'll feel
terrific. Yet if you try to tell your
family or friends how pleased you w
T ere about the encounter, you are
likely to be met with blank stares,


because the "hello" means nothing
to people who are not aspiring
athletes in your high schooL


All of the sources of motivation

we've talked about so far are selflimiting, That is, when a need is
gratified, it can no longer motivate a
person. Once a predetermined goal
or level of achievement is reached,
the need to go any further loses
urgency, A friend of mine was
thrust into a premature "mid-life
crisis" when, in recognition of the
excellent work he had been doing,
he was named a


vice president of the corporation.


Such a position had been a life-long
goal. When he had suddenly
attained it, he found himself
looking for some other way to
motivate himself.


Self-Actualization Needs


For Maslow, self-actualization
stems from a personal realization
that "what I can be, I must be." The
title of a movie about athletes,
Personal Best, captures what selfactualization means: the need to
achieve one's utter personal best in
a chosen field of endeavor. Once

someone's source of motivation is
self-actualization, his drive to


perform has no limit. Thus, its most
important characteristic is that
unlike other sources of motivation,
which extinguish themselves after
the needs are fulfilled, selfactualization continues to motivate
people to ever higher levels of
performance.


Two inner forces can drive a person
to use all of his capabilities. He can
be competence -driven or
achievement-driven. The former
concerns itself with job or task
mastery. A virtuoso violinist who
continues to practice day after day
is obviously moved by something
other than a need for esteem and


recognition. He works to sharpen
his own skill, trying to do a little bit
better this time than the time
before, just as a teenager on a
skateboard practices the same trick
over and over again. The same
teenager may not sit still for ten
minutes to do homework, but on a
skateboard he is relentless, driven
by the self-actualization need, a
need to get better that has no limit.


The achievement-driven path to
self-actualization is not quite like
this. Some people— not the
majority—are moved by an abstract
need to achieve in all that they do. A
psychology lab experiment


illustrated the behavior of such
people. Some volunteers were put
into a room in which pegs were set
at various places on the floor. Each
person was given some rings but
not instructed what to


do with them. People eventually
started to toss the rings onto the
pegs. Some casually tossed the rings
at faraway pegs; others stood over
the pegs and dropped the rings
down onto them. Still others walked
just far enough away from the pegs
so that to toss a ring onto a peg
constituted a challenge. These
people worked at the boundary of
their capability.


Researchers classified the three
types of behavior. The first group,
termed gamblers, took high risks
but exerted no influence on the

outcome of events. The second
group, termed conservatives, were
people who took very little risk. The
third group, termed achievers, had
to test the limits of what they could
do, and with no prompting
demonstrated the point of the
experiment: namely, that some
people simply must test
themselves. By challenging
themselves, these people were
likely to miss a peg several times,
but when they began to ring the peg


consistently, they gained
satisfaction and a sense of
achievement. The point is that both
competence- and achievementoriented people spontaneously try
to test the outer limits of their

abilities.


When the need to stretch is not
spontaneous, management needs to
create an environment to foster it.
In an MBO system, for example,
objectives should be set at a point
high enough so that even if the
individual (or organization) pushes
himself hard, he will still only have
a fifty-fifty chance of making them.
Output will tend to be greater when


everybody strives for a level of
achievement beyond his immediate
grasp, even though trying means
failure half the time. Such goalsetting is extremely important if
what you want is peak performance
from yourself and your
subordinates.


Moreover, if we want to cultivate
achievement-driven motivation, we
need to create an environment that
values and emphasizes output. My
first job was with a research and
development laboratory, where a lot
of people were very highly
motivated but tended to be


HIGH OUTPUT MANAGEMENT


knowledge-centered. They were
driven to know more, but not
necessarily to know more in order
to produce concrete results.
Consequently, relatively little was
actually achieved. The value system
at Intel is completely the reverse.
The Ph.D. in computer science who
knows an answer in the abstract,
yet does not apply it to create some
tangible output, gets little
recognition, but a junior engineer
who produces results is highly
valued and esteemed. And that is

how it should be.


Money and Task-Relevant Feedback


We now come to the question of
how money motivates people. At
the lower levels of the motivation
hierarchy, money is obviously
important, needed to buy the
necessities of life. Once there is
enough money to bring a person up
to a level he expects of himself,
more money will not motivate.
Consider people who work at our
assembly plant in the Caribbean.
The standard of living there is quite
low, and people who work for us
enjoy one substantially higher than
most of the population. Yet, in the
early years of operation, many


employees worked just long enough
to accumulate some small sum of
money and then quit. For them,
money's motivation was clearly
limited; having reached a
predetermined notion of how much
money they wanted, more money
and a steady job provided no more
motivation.


Now consider a venture capitalist
who after making ten million
dollars is still very hard at work
trying to make another ten.
Physiological, safety, or social needs
hardly apply here. Moreover,
because venture capitalists usually
don't publicize their successes, they


are not driven by a need for esteem
or recognition. So it appears that at
the upper level of the need
hierarchy, when one is selfactualized, money in itself is no
longer a source of motivation but
rather a measure of achievement.
Money in the physiological- and
security-driven modes only moti

vates until the need is satisfied, but
money as a measure of
achievement will motivate without

limit. Thus the second ten million
can be just as important to the
venture capitalist as the first, since
it is not the utilitarian need for the
money that drives him but the


achievement that it implies, and the
need for achievement is boundless.


A simple test can be used to
determine where someone is in the
motivational hierarchy. If the
absolute sum of a raise in salary an
individual receives is important to
him, he is working mostly within
the physiological or safety modes.
If, however, what matters to him is
how his raise stacks up against
what other people got, he is
motivated by esteem/recognition or
self-actualization, because in this
case money is clearly a measure.


Once in the self-actualization mode,


a person needs measures to gauge
his progress and achievement. The
most important type of measure is
feedback on his performance. For
the self-actualized person driven to
improve his competence, the
feedback mechanism lies within

that individual himself. Our

virtuoso violinist knows how the
music should sound, knows when it
is not right, and will strive tirelessly
to get it right. Accordingly, if the
possibility for improvement does
not exist, the desire to keep
practicing vanishes. I knew an
Olympic fencing champion, a
Hungarian who immigrated to this


country. When I ran into him
recently, he told me that he had
quit fencing shordy after arriving in
the U.S. He said that the level of
competition here was not high
enough to produce someone who
could give him a contest, and that
he couldn't bear to fence any longer
because every time he did, he felt
his skill was diminishing.


What are some of the feedback

mechanisms or measures in the
workplace? The most appropriate
measures tie an employee's
performance to the workings of the
organization. If performance
indicators and milestones in a
