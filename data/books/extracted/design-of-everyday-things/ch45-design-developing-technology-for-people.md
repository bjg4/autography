**Design: Developing Technology for People**


Design is a marvelous discipline, bringing together technology and
people, business and politics, culture and commerce. The different
pressures on design are severe, presenting huge challenges to the
designer. At the same time, the designers must always keep foremost in mind that the products are to be used by people. This is
what makes design such a rewarding discipline: On the one hand,
woefully complex constraints to overcome; on the other hand, the
opportunity to develop things that assist and enrich the lives of
people, that bring benefits and enjoyment.

###### DESIGN IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS


The realities of the world impose severe constraints
upon the design of products. Up to now I have described the ideal case, assuming that human-centered
design principles could be followed in a vacuum; that
is, without attention to the real world of competition, costs, and
schedules. Conflicting requirements will come from different
sources, all of which are legitimate, all of which need to be resolved.
Compromises must be made by all involved.
Now it is time to examine the concerns outside of human
centered design that affect the development of products. I start
with the impact of competitive forces that drive the introduction
of extra features, often to excess: the cause of the disease dubbed
“featuritis,” whose major symptom is “creeping featurism.” From
there, I examine the drivers of change, starting with technological
drivers. When new technologies emerge, there is a temptation to
develop new products immediately. But the time for radically new
products to become successful is measured in years, decades, or
in some instances centuries. This causes me to examine the two

forms of product innovation relevant to design: incremental (less
glamorous, but most common) and radical (most glamorous, but
rarely successful).

I conclude with reflections about the history and future prospects
of this book. The first edition of this book has had a long and fruitful life. Twenty-five years is an amazingly long time for a book centered around technology to have remained relevant. If this revised
and expanded edition lasts an equally long time, that means fifty
years of _The Design of Everyday Things_ . In these next twenty-five
years, what new developments will take place? What will be the
role of technology in our lives, for the future of books, and what
are the moral obligations of the design profession? And finally, for
how long will the principles in this book remain relevant? It should
be no surprise that I believe they will always be just as relevant as
they were twenty-five years ago, just as relevant as they are today.
Why? The reason is simple. The design of technology to fit human
needs and capabilities is determined by the psychology of people.
Yes, technologies may change, but people stay the same.
