**Human Thought: Mostly Subconscious**


Why do we need to know about the human mind? Because things
are designed to be used by people, and without a deep understanding of people, the designs are apt to be faulty, difficult to
use, difficult to understand. That is why it is useful to consider the
seven stages of action. The mind is more difficult to comprehend
than actions. Most of us start by believing we already understand
both human behavior and the human mind. After all, we are all hu
man: we have all lived with ourselves all of our lives, and we like

to think we understand ourselves. But the truth is, we don’t. Most
of human behavior is a result of subconscious processes. We are
unaware of them. As a result, many of our beliefs about how people behave—including beliefs about ourselves—are wrong. That is
why we have the multiple social and behavioral sciences, with a
good dash of mathematics, economics, computer science, information science, and neuroscience.
Consider the following simple experiment. Do all three steps:


1. Wiggle the second finger of your hand.
2. Wiggle the third finger of the same hand.
3. Describe what you did differently those two times.


On the surface, the answer seems simple: I thought about moving my fingers and they moved. The difference is that I thought


**44** _The Design of Everyday Things_


about a different finger each time. Yes, that’s true. But how did that
thought get transmitted into action, into the commands that caused
different muscles in the arm to control the tendons that wiggled
the fingers? This is completely hidden from consciousness.
The human mind is immensely complex, having evolved over
a long period with many specialized structures. The study of the
mind is the subject of multiple disciplines, including the behavioral and social sciences, cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, and the information and computer sciences. Despite many
advances in our understanding, much still remains mysterious, yet
to be learned. One of the mysteries concerns the nature of and distinction between those activities that are conscious and those that

are not. Most of the brain’s operations are subconscious, hidden
beneath our awareness. It is only the highest level, what I call _re-_
_flective,_ that is conscious.
Conscious attention is necessary to learn most things, but after
the initial learning, continued practice and study, sometimes for
thousands of hours over a period of years, produces what psychologists call “overlearning,” Once skills have been overlearned, performance appears to be effortless, done automatically, with little or
no awareness. For example, answer these questions:


What is the phone number of a friend?
What is Beethoven’s phone number?
What is the capital of:

 - Brazil?

 - Wales?

 - The United States?

 - Estonia?


Think about how you answered these questions. The answers
you knew come immediately to mind, but with no awareness of
how that happened. You simply “know” the answer. Even the ones
you got wrong came to mind without any awareness. You might
have been aware of some doubt, but not of how the name entered
your consciousness. As for the countries for which you didn’t

know the answer, you probably knew you didn’t know those immediately, without effort. Even if you knew you knew, but couldn’t
quite recall it, you didn’t know how you knew that, or what was
happening as you tried to remember.
You might have had trouble with the phone number of a friend
because most of us have turned over to our technology the job
of remembering phone numbers. I don’t know anybody’s phone
number—I barely remember my own. When I wish to call someone, I just do a quick search in my contact list and have the telephone place the call. Or I just push the “2” button on the phone
for a few seconds, which autodials my home. Or in my auto, I can
simply speak: “Call home.” What’s the number? I don’t know: my
technology knows. Do we count our technology as an extension
of our memory systems? Of our thought processes? Of our mind?
What about Beethoven’s phone number? If I asked my computer,
it would take a long time, because it would have to search all the
people I know to see whether any one of them was Beethoven.
But you immediately discarded the question as nonsensical. You
don’t personally know Beethoven. And anyway, he is dead. Besides, he died in the early 1800s and the phone wasn’t invented
until the late 1800s. How do we know what we do not know so

rapidly? Yet some things that we do know can take a long time to
retrieve. For example, answer this:


_In the house you lived in three houses ago, as you entered the front door,_
_was the doorknob on the left or right?_


Now you have to engage in conscious, reflective problem solving, first to retrieve just which house is being talked about, and
then what the correct answer is. Most people can determine the
house, but have difficulty answering the question because they can
readily imagine the doorknob on both sides of the door. The way to
solve this problem is to imagine doing some activity, such as walking up to the front door while carrying heavy packages with both
hands: how do you open the door? Alternatively, visualize yourself
inside the house, rushing to the front door to open it for a visitor.


**46** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Usually one of these imagined scenarios provides the answer. But
note how different the memory retrieval for this question was from
the retrieval for the others. All these questions involved long-term
memory, but in very different ways. The earlier questions were
memory for factual information, what is called _declarative memory._
The last question could have been answered factually, but is usually most easily answered by recalling the activities performed to
open the door. This is called _procedural memory._ I return to a discussion of human memory in Chapter 3.
Walking, talking, reading. Riding a bicycle or driving a car. Singing. All of these skills take considerable time and practice to master, but once mastered, they are often done quite automatically. For
experts, only especially difficult or unexpected situations require

conscious attention.

Because we are only aware of the reflective level of conscious
processing, we tend to believe that all human thought is conscious. But it isn’t. We also tend to believe that thought can be
separated from emotion. This is also false. Cognition and emotion cannot be separated. Cognitive thoughts lead to emotions:
emotions drive cognitive thoughts. The brain is structured to act
upon the world, and every action carries with it expectations, and
these expectations drive emotions. That is why much of language
is based on physical metaphors, why the body and its interaction
with the environment are essential components of human thought.
Emotion is highly underrated. In fact, the emotional system is
a powerful information processing system that works in tandem
with cognition. Cognition attempts to make sense of the world:
emotion assigns value. It is the emotional system that determines
whether a situation is safe or threatening, whether something that
is happening is good or bad, desirable or not. Cognition provides
understanding: emotion provides value judgments. A human without a working emotional system has difficulty making choices. A
human without a cognitive system is dysfunctional.
Because much human behavior is subconscious—that is, it oc
curs without conscious awareness—we often don’t know what we

are about to do, say, or think until after we have done it. It’s as

if we had two minds: the subconscious and the conscious, which
don’t always talk to each other. Not what you have been taught?
True, nonetheless. More and more evidence is accumulating that
we use logic and reason after the fact, to justify our decisions to
ourselves (to our conscious minds) and to others. Bizarre? Yes, but
don’t protest: enjoy it.
Subconscious thought matches patterns, finding the best possible
match of one’s past experience to the current one. It proceeds rapidly and automatically, without effort. Subconscious processing is
one of our strengths. It is good at detecting general trends, at recognizing the relationship between what we now experience and what
has happened in the past. And it is good at generalizing, at making
predictions about the general trend, based on few examples. But
subconscious thought can find matches that are inappropriate or
wrong, and it may not distinguish the common from the rare. Subconscious thought is biased toward regularity and structure, and it
is limited in formal power. It may not be capable of symbolic manipulation, of careful reasoning through a sequence of steps.
Conscious thought is quite different. It is slow and labored.
Here is where we slowly ponder decisions, think through alternatives, compare different choices. Conscious thought considers
first this approach, then that—comparing, rationalizing, finding
explanations. Formal logic, mathematics, decision theory: these are
the tools of conscious thought. Both conscious and subconscious
modes of thought are powerful and essential aspects of human life.
Both can provide insightful leaps and creative moments. And both
are subject to errors, misconceptions, and failures.
Emotion interacts with cognition biochemically, bathing the brain
with hormones, transmitted either through the bloodstream or
through ducts in the brain, modifying the behavior of brain cells.
Hormones exert powerful biases on brain operation. Thus, in tense,
threatening situations, the emotional system triggers the release of
hormones that bias the brain to focus upon relevant parts of the
environment. The muscles tense in preparation for action. In calm,
nonthreatening situations, the emotional system triggers the release
of hormones that relax the muscles and bias the brain toward explo

ration and creativity. Now the brain is more apt to notice changes in
the environment, to be distracted by events, and to piece together
events and knowledge that might have seemed unrelated earlier.
A positive emotional state is ideal for creative thought, but it is
not very well suited for getting things done. Too much, and we call
the person scatterbrained, flitting from one topic to another, unable
to finish one thought before another comes to mind. A brain in a
negative emotional state provides focus: precisely what is needed
to maintain attention on a task and finish it. Too much, however,
and we get tunnel vision, where people are unable to look beyond
their narrow point of view. Both the positive, relaxed state and the
anxious, negative, and tense state are valuable and powerful tools
for human creativity and action. The extremes of both states, however, can be dangerous.
