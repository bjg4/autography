**The Seven Stages of Action**
**and the Three Levels of Processing**


The stages of action can readily be associated with the three different levels of processing, as shown in Figure 2.4. At the lowest level
are the visceral levels of calmness or anxiety when approaching a
task or evaluating the state of the world. Then, in the middle level,
are the behavioral ones driven by expectations on the execution
side—for example, hope and fear—and emotions driven by the
confirmation of those expectations on the evaluation side—for example, relief or despair. At the highest level are the reflective emotions, ones that assess the results in terms of the presumed causal
agents and the consequences, both immediate and long-term. Here
is where satisfaction and pride occur, or perhaps blame and anger.
One important emotional state is the one that accompanies complete immersion into an activity, a state that the social scientist
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has labeled “flow.” Csikszentmihalyi
has long studied how people interact with their work and play,
and how their lives reflect this intermix of activities. When in the

flow state, people lose track of time and the outside environment.

They are at one with the task
they are performing. The task,
moreover, is at just the proper
level of difficulty: difficult
enough to provide a challenge
and require continued attention, but not so difficult that it
invokes frustration and anxiety.
Csikszentmihalyi’s work
shows how the behavioral

level creates a powerful set of
emotional responses. Here, the

feelings as we continue through
the many cycles of action. An easy task, far below our skill level, makes
it so easy to meet expectations that there is no challenge. Very little or
no processing effort is required, which leads to apathy or boredom. A
difficult task, far above our skill, leads to so many failed expectations
that it causes frustration, anxiety, and helplessness. The flow state occurs when the challenge of the activity just slightly exceeds our skill
level, so full attention is continually required. Flow requires that the
activity be neither too easy nor too difficult relative to our level of skill.
The constant tension coupled with continual progress and success can
be an engaging, immersive experience sometimes lasting for hours.
