**The Design Challenge**


It is difficult to do good design. That is why it is such a rich, engaging profession with results that can be powerful and effective.
Designers are asked to figure out how to manage complex things,
to manage the interaction of technology and people. Good designers are quick learners, for today they might be asked to design a
camera; tomorrow, to design a transportation system or a company’s organizational structure. How can one person work across so
many different domains? Because the fundamental principles of
designing for people are the same across all domains. People are
the same, and so the design principles are the same.
Designers are only one part of the complex chain of processes
and different professions involved in producing a product. Although

the theme of this book is the importance of satisfying the needs
of the people who will ultimately use the product, other aspects of
the product are important; for example, its engineering effectiveness, which includes its capabilities, reliability, and serviceability;
its cost; and its financial viability, which usually means profitability. Will people buy it? Each of these aspects poses its own set of
requirements, sometimes ones that appear to be in opposition to
those of the other aspects. Schedule and budget are often the two

most severe constraints.

Designers try hard to determine people’s real needs and to fulfill them, whereas marketing is concerned with determining what
people will actually buy. What people need and what they buy are
two different things, but both are important. It doesn’t matter how
great the product is if nobody buys it. Similarly, if a company’s
products are not profitable, the company might very well go out
of business. In dysfunctional companies, each division of the company is skeptical of the value added to the product by the other
divisions.

In a properly run organization, team members coming from all
the various aspects of the product cycle get together to share their
requirements and to work harmoniously to design and produce
a product that satisfies them, or at least that does so with acceptable compromises. In dysfunctional companies, each team works
in isolation, often arguing with the other teams, often watching its
designs or specifications get changed by others in what each team
considers an unreasonable way. Producing a good product requires
a lot more than good technical skills: it requires a harmonious,
smoothly functioning, cooperative and respectful organization.
The design process must address numerous constraints. In the
sections that follow, I examine these other factors.


**PRODUCTS HAVE MULTIPLE, CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS**


Designers must please their clients, who are not always the end
users. Consider major household appliances, such as stoves, refrigerators, dishwashers, and clothes washers and dryers; and even
faucets and thermostats for heating and air-conditioning systems.

They are often purchased by housing developers or landlords.
In businesses, purchasing departments make decisions for large
companies; and owners or managers, for small companies. In all
these cases, the purchaser is probably interested primarily in price,
perhaps in size or appearance, almost certainly not in usability.
And once devices are purchased and installed, the purchaser has
no further interest in them. The manufacturer has to attend to the

requirements of these decision makers, because these are the people who actually buy the product. Yes, the needs of the eventual
users are important, but to the business, they seem of secondary
importance.
In some situations, cost dominates. Suppose, for example, you
are part of a design team for office copiers. In large companies,
copying machines are purchased by the Printing and Duplicating
Center, then dispersed to the various departments. The copiers are
purchased after a formal “request for proposals” has gone out to
manufacturers and dealers of machines. The selection is almost

always based on price plus a list of required features. Usability?
Not considered. Training costs? Not considered. Maintenance? Not
considered. There are no requirements regarding understandability or usability of the product, even though in the end those aspects
of the product can end up costing the company a lot of money
in wasted time, increased need for service calls and training, and
even lowered staff morale and lower productivity.
The focus on sales price is one reason we get unusable copying
machines and telephone systems in our places of employment. If
people complained strongly enough, usability could become a requirement in the purchasing specifications, and that requirement
could trickle back to the designers. But without this feedback, designers must often design the cheapest possible products because
those are what sell. Designers need to understand their customers,
and in many cases, the customer is the person who purchases the
product, not the person who actually uses it. It is just as important to
study those who do the purchasing as it is to study those who use it.
To make matters even more difficult, yet another set of people
needs to be considered: the engineers, developers, manufacturing,


six: _Design Thinking_ **241**


services, sales, and marketing people who have to translate the
ideas from the design team into reality, and then sell and support
the product after it is shipped. These groups are users, too, not of
the product itself, but of the output of the design team. Designers
are used to accommodating the needs of the product users, but
they seldom consider the needs of the other groups involved in
the product process. But if their needs are not considered, then
as the product development moves through the process from design to engineering, to marketing, to manufacturing, and so on,
each new group will discover that it doesn’t meet their needs, so
they will change it. But piecemeal, after-the-fact changes invariably
weaken the cohesion of the product. If all these requirements were
known at the start of the design process, a much more satisfactory
resolution could have been devised.

Usually the different company divisions have intelligent people trying to do what is best for the company. When they make
changes to a design, it is because their requirements were not suitably served. Their concerns and needs are legitimate, but changes
introduced in this way are almost always detrimental. The best
way to counteract this is to ensure that representatives from all
the divisions are present during the entire design process, starting
with the decision to launch the product, continuing all the way
through shipment to customers, service requirements, and repairs
and returns. This way, all the concerns can be heard as soon as
they are discovered. There must be a multidisciplinary team overseeing the entire design, engineering, and manufacturing process
that shares all departmental issues and concerns from day one, so
that everyone can design to satisfy them, and when conflicts arise,
the group together can determine the most satisfactory solution.
Sadly, it is the rare company that is organized this way.
Design is a complex activity. But the only way this complex process comes together is if all the relevant parties work together as
a team. It isn’t design against engineering, against marketing,
against manufacturing: it is design together with all these other
players. Design must take into account sales and marketing, servicing and help desks, engineering and manufacturing, costs and


**242** _The Design of Everyday Things_


schedules. That’s why it’s so challenging. That’s why it’s so much
fun and rewarding when it all comes together to create a successful product.


**DESIGNING FOR SPECIAL PEOPLE**


There is no such thing as the average person. This poses a particular
problem for the designer, who usually must come up with a single
design for everyone. The designer can consult handbooks with tables that show average arm reach and seated height, how far the
average person can stretch backward while seated, and how much
room is needed for average hips, knees, and elbows. _Physical anthro-_
_pometry_ is what the field is called. With data, the designer can try
to meet the size requirements for almost everyone, say for the 90th,
95th, or even the 99th percentile. Suppose the product is designed
to accommodate the 95th percentile, that is, for everyone except the
5 percent of people who are smaller or larger. That leaves out a lot
of people. The United States has approximately 300 million people,
so 5 percent is 15 million. Even if the design aims at the 99th percentile it would still leave out 3 million people. And this is just for
the United States: the world has 7 billion people. Design for the 99th
percentile of the world and 70 million people are left out.
Some problems are not solved by adjustments or averages: Average
a left-hander with a right-hander and what do you get? Sometimes it
is simply impossible to build one product that accommodates everyone, so the answer is to build different versions of the product.
After all, we would not be happy with a store that sells only one
size and type of clothing: we expect clothing that fits our bodies,
and people come in a very wide range of sizes. We don’t expect
the large variety of goods found in a clothing store to apply to
all people or activities; we expect a wide variety of cooking appliances, automobiles, and tools so we can select the ones that precisely match our requirements. One device simply cannot work for
everyone. Even such simple tools as pencils need to be designed
differently for different activities and types of people.
Consider the special problems of the aged and infirm, the handicapped, the blind or near blind, the deaf or hard of hearing, the


six: _Design Thinking_ **243**


very short or very tall, or people who speak other languages.
Design for interests and skill levels. Don’t be trapped by overly
general, inaccurate stereotypes. I return to these groups in the

next section.


**THE STIGMA PROBLEM**


_“I don’t want to go into a care facility. I’d have to be around all those old_
_people.”_ (Comment by a 95-year-old man _._ )


Many devices designed to aid people with particular difficulties fail. They may be well designed, they may solve the problem,
but they are rejected by their intended users. Why? Most people do not wish to advertise their infirmities. Actually, many people
do not wish to admit having infirmities, even to themselves.
When Sam Farber wanted to develop a set of household tools
that his arthritic wife could use, he worked hard to find a solution
that was good for everyone. The result was a series of tools that
revolutionized this field. For example, vegetable peelers used to be
an inexpensive, simple metal tool, often of the form shown on the
left in Figure 6.3. These were awkward to use, painful to hold, and
not even that effective at

peeling, but everyone assumed that this was how

they had to be.
After considerable re
search, Farber settled
upon the peeler shown on
the right in Figure 6.3 and
built a company, OXO, to
manufacture and distrib

**244** _The Design of Everyday Things_


sign was more expensive than the regular peeler, it was so successful that today, many companies make variations on this theme. You
may have trouble seeing the OXO peeler as revolutionary because
today, many have followed in these footsteps. Design has become
a major theme for even simple tools such as peelers, as demonstrated by the center peeler of Figure 6.3.
Consider the two things special about the OXO peeler: cost and
design for someone with an infirmity. Cost? The original peeler
was very inexpensive, so a peeler that is many times the cost of
the inexpensive one is still inexpensive. What about the special
design for people with arthritis? The virtues for them were never
mentioned, so how did they find it? OXO did the right thing and
let the world know that this was a better product. And the world
took note and made it successful. As for people who needed the
better handle? It didn’t take long for the word to spread. Today,
many companies have followed the OXO route, producing peelers
that work extremely well, are comfortable, and are colorful. See
Figure 6.3.
Would you use a walker, wheelchair, crutches, or a cane? Many
people avoid these, even though they need them, because of the
negative image they cast: the stigma. Why? Years ago, a cane was
fashionable: people who didn’t need them would use them anyway, twirling them, pointing with them, hiding brandy or whisky,
knives or guns inside their handles. Just look at any movie depicting nineteenth-century London. Why can’t devices for those who
need them be as sophisticated and fashionable today?
Of all the devices intended to aid the elderly, perhaps the most
shunned is the walker. Most of these devices are ugly. They cry out,
“Disability here.” Why not transform them into products to be proud
of? Fashion statements, perhaps. This thinking has already begun
with some medical appliances. Some companies are making hearing
aids and glasses for children and adolescents with special colors and
styles that appeal to these age groups. Fashion accessories. Why not?
Those of you who are young, do not smirk. Physical disabilities
may begin early, starting in the midtwenties. By their midforties,
most people’s eyes can no longer adjust sufficiently to focus over


six: _Design Thinking_ **245**


the entire range of distances, so something is necessary to compensate, whether reading glasses, bifocals, special contact lenses, or
even surgical correction.
Many people in their eighties and nineties are still in good mental and physical shape, and the accumulated wisdom of their years
leads to superior performance in many tasks. But physical strength
and agility do decrease, reaction time slows, and vision and hearing show impairments, along with decreased ability to divide attention or switch rapidly among competing tasks.
For anyone who is considering growing old, I remind you that
although physical abilities diminish with age, many mental capacities continue to improve, especially those dependent upon an
expert accumulation of experience, deep reflection, and enhanced
knowledge. Younger people are more agile, more willing to experiment and take risks. Older people have more knowledge and
wisdom. The world benefits from having a mix and so do design

teams.

Designing for people with special needs is often called _inclusive_
or _universal_ _design._ Those names are fitting, for it is often the case that
everyone benefits. Make the lettering larger, with high-contrast type,
and everyone can read it better. In dim light, even the people with
the world’s best eyesight will benefit from such lettering. Make
things adjustable, and you will find that more people can use it,
and even people who liked it before may now like it better. Just
as I invoke the so-called error message of Figure 4.6 as my normal
way of exiting a program because it is easier than the so-called correct way, special features made for people with special needs often
turn out to be useful for a wide variety of people.
The best solution to the problem of designing for everyone is
flexibility: flexibility in the size of the images on computer screens,
in the sizes, heights, and angles of tables and chairs. Allow people
to adjust their own seats, tables, and working devices. Allow them
to adjust lighting, font size, and contrast. Flexibility on our highways might mean ensuring that there are alternative routes with
different speed limits. Fixed solutions will invariably fail with some


**246** _The Design of Everyday Things_


people; flexible solutions at least offer a chance for those with different needs.


**Complexity Is Good;**
**It Is Confusion That Is Bad**


The everyday kitchen is complex. We have multiple instruments
just for serving and eating food. The typical kitchen contains all
sorts of cutting utensils, heating units, and cooking apparatus. The
easiest way to understand the complexity is to try to cook in an
unfamiliar kitchen. Even excellent cooks have trouble working in

a new environment.

Someone else’s kitchen looks complicated and confusing, but
your own kitchen does not. The same can probably be said for every room in the home. Notice that this feeling of confusion is really
one of knowledge. My kitchen looks confusing to you, but not to
me. In turn, your kitchen looks confusing to me, but not to you.
So the confusion is not in the kitchen: it is in the mind. “Why can’t
things be made simple?” goes the cry. Well, one reason is that life
is complex, as are the tasks we encounter. Our tools must match
the tasks.

I feel so strongly about this that I wrote an entire book on the
topic, _Living with Complexity,_ in which I argued that complexity
is essential: it is confusion that is undesirable. I distinguished between “complexity,” which we need to match the activities we take
part in, and “complicated,” which I defined to mean “confusing.”
How do we avoid confusion? Ah, here is where the designer’s
skills come into play.
The most important principle for taming complexity is to provide a good conceptual model, which has already been well covered in this book. Remember the kitchen’s apparent complexity?
The people who use it understand why each item is stored where
it is: there is usually structure to the apparent randomness. Even
exceptions fit: even if the reason is something like, “It was too big
to fit in the proper drawer and I didn’t know where else to put it,”
that is reason enough to give structure and understanding to the


six: _Design Thinking_ **247**


person who stored the item there. Complex things are no longer
complicated once they are understood.
