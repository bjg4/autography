**Precise Behavior from Imprecise Knowledge**


Precise behavior can emerge from imprecise knowledge for four

reasons:


1. **Knowledge is both in the head and in the world.** Technically,
knowledge can only be in the head, because knowledge requires interpretation and understanding, but once the world’s structure has
been interpreted and understood, it counts as knowledge. Much of
the knowledge a person needs to do a task can be derived from the
information in the world. Behavior is determined by combining the
knowledge in the head with that in the world. For this chapter, I will
use the term “knowledge” for both what is in the head and what is
in the world. Although technically imprecise, it simplifies the discussion and understanding.

2. **Great precision is not required.** Precision, accuracy, and completeness of knowledge are seldom required. Perfect behavior results if
the combined knowledge in the head and in the world is sufficient to
distinguish an appropriate choice from all others.
3. **Natural constraints exist in the world.** The world has many natural, physical constraints that restrict the possible behavior: such
things as the order in which parts can go together and the ways
by which an object can be moved, picked up, or otherwise manipulated. This is knowledge in the world. Each object has physical
features—projections, depressions, screw threads, appendages—
that limit its relationships with other objects, the operations that
can be performed on it, what can be attached to it, and so on.
4. **Knowledge of cultural constraints and conventions exists in the**

**head.** Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial re
strictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many
cases leaving only one or two possibilities. This is knowledge in the
head. Once learned, these constraints apply to a wide variety of cir
cumstances.


Because behavior can be guided by the combination of internal
and external knowledge and constraints, people can minimize the
amount of material they must learn, as well as the completeness,
precision, accuracy, or depth of the learning. They also can deliberately organize the environment to support behavior. This is how
nonreaders can hide their inability, even in situations where their
job requires reading skills. People with hearing deficits (or with
normal hearing but in noisy environments) learn to use other cues.
Many of us manage quite well when in novel, confusing situations
where we do not know what is expected of us. How do we do this?
We arrange things so that we do not need to have complete knowledge or we rely upon the knowledge of the people around us,
copying their behavior or getting them to do the required actions.
It is actually quite amazing how often it is possible to hide one’s
ignorance, to get by without understanding or even much interest.
Although it is best when people have considerable knowledge and
experience using a particular product—knowledge in the head—


**76** _The Design of Everyday Things_


the designer can put sufficient cues into the design—knowledge
in the world—that good performance results even in the absence
of previous knowledge. Combine the two, knowledge in the head
and in the world, and performance is even better. How can the
designer put knowledge into the device itself?
Chapters 1 and 2 introduced a wide range of fundamental design
principles derived from research on human cognition and emotion.
This chapter shows how knowledge in the world combines with
knowledge in the head. Knowledge in the head is knowledge in
the human memory system, so this chapter contains a brief review
of the critical aspects of memory necessary for the design of usable
products. I emphasize that for practical purposes, we do not need
to know the details of scientific theories but simpler, more general,
useful approximations. Simplified models are the key to successful
application. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how natural mappings present information in the world in a manner readily
interpreted and usable.


**KNOWLEDGE IS IN THE WORLD**


Whenever knowledge needed to do a task is readily available in
the world, the need for us to learn it diminishes. For example, we
lack knowledge about common coins, even though we recognize
them just fine (Figure 3.1). In knowing what our currency looks
like, we don’t need to know all the details, simply sufficient knowledge to distinguish one value of currency from another. Only a
small minority of people must know enough to distinguish counterfeit from legitimate money.
Or consider typing. Many typists have not memorized the keyboard. Usually each key is labeled, so nontypists can hunt and peck
letter by letter, relying on knowledge in the world and minimizing
the time required for learning. The problem is that such typing is
slow and difficult. With experience, of course, hunt-and-peckers
learn the positions of many of the letters on the keyboard, even
without instruction, and typing speed increases notably, quickly
surpassing handwriting speeds and, for some, reaching quite respectable rates. Peripheral vision and the feel of the keyboard


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **77**


provide some knowledge about key locations. Frequently used
keys become completely learned, infrequently used keys are not
learned well, and the other keys are partially learned. But as long
as a typist needs to watch the keyboard, the speed is limited. The
knowledge is still mostly in the world, not in the head.
If a person needs to type large amounts of material regularly, further investment is worthwhile: a course, a book, or an interactive
program. The important thing is to learn the proper placement of
fingers on the keyboard, to learn to type without looking, to get
knowledge about the keyboard from the world into the head. It
takes a few weeks to learn the system and several months of practice to become expert. But the payoff for all this effort is increased
typing speed, increased accuracy, and decreased mental load and
effort at the time of typing.
We only need to remember sufficient knowledge to let us get our
tasks done. Because so much knowledge is available in the environment, it is surprising how little we need to learn. This is one
reason people can function well in their environment and still be
unable to describe what they do.
People function through their use of two kinds of knowledge:
knowledge _of_ and knowledge _how_ . Knowledge _of_ —what psychologists call _declarative knowledge_ —includes the knowledge of facts
and rules. “Stop at red traffic lights.” “New York City is north of
Rome.” “China has twice as many people as India.” “To get the
key out of the ignition of a Saab car, the gearshift must be in reverse.” Declarative knowledge is easy to write and to teach. Note
that knowledge of the rules does not mean they are followed. The
drivers in many cities are often quite knowledgeable about the official driving regulations, but they do not necessarily obey them.
Moreover, the knowledge does not have to be true. New York City
is actually south of Rome. China has only slightly more people
than India (roughly 10 percent). People may know many things:
that doesn’t mean they are true.
Knowledge _how_ —what psychologists call _procedural knowledge_ —
is the knowledge that enables a person to be a skilled musician,
to return a serve in tennis, or to move the tongue properly when


**78** _The Design of Everyday Things_


saying the phrase “frightening witches.” Procedural knowledge is
difficult or impossible to write down and difficult to teach. It is
best taught by demonstration and best learned through practice.
Even the best teachers cannot usually describe what they are doing. Procedural knowledge is largely subconscious, residing at the
behavioral level of processing.
Knowledge in the world is usually easy to come by. Signifiers,
physical constraints, and natural mappings are all perceivable cues
that act as knowledge in the world. This type of knowledge occurs
so commonly that we take it for granted. It is everywhere: the locations of letters on a keyboard; the lights and labels on controls
that remind us of their purpose and give information about the
current state of the device. Industrial equipment is replete with
signal lights, indicators, and other reminders. We make extensive
use of written notes. We place items in specific locations as reminders. In general, people structure their environment to provide a
considerable amount of the knowledge required for something to
be remembered.

Many organize their lives spatially in the world, creating a pile
here, a pile there, each indicating some activity to be done, some
event in progress. Probably everybody uses such a strategy to
some extent. Look around you at the variety of ways people arrange their rooms and desks. Many styles of organization are possible, but invariably the physical layout and visibility of the items
convey information about relative importance.


**WHEN PRECISION IS UNEXPECTEDLY REQUIRED**


Normally, people do not need precision in their judgments. All that
is needed is the combination of knowledge in the world and in the
head that makes decisions unambiguous. Everything works just
fine unless the environment changes so that the combined knowledge is no longer sufficient: this can lead to havoc. At least three
countries discovered this fact the hard way: the United States,
when it introduced the Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin; Great
Britain, a one-pound coin (before the switch to decimal currency);
and France, a ten-franc coin (before the conversion to the common


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **79**


European currency, the euro). The US dollar coin was confused
with the existing twenty-five-cent piece (the quarter), and the British pound coin with the then five-pence piece that had the same
diameter. Here is what happened in France:


_PARIS With a good deal of fanfare, the French government released the_
_new 10-franc coin (worth a little more than $1.50) on Oct. 22 [1986]._
_The public looked at it, weighed it, and began confusing it so quickly_
_with the half-franc coin (worth only 8 cents) that a crescendo of fury_
_and ridicule fell on both the government and the coin._
_Five weeks later, Minister of Finance Edouard Balladur suspended_
_circulation of the coin. Within another four weeks, he canceled it_
_altogether._
_In retrospect, the French decision seems so foolish that it is hard to_
_fathom how it could have been made. After much study, designers came_
_up with a silver-colored coin made of nickel and featuring a modernistic_
_drawing by artist Joaquim Jimenez of a Gallic rooster on one side and_
_of Marianne, the female symbol of the French republic, on the other._
_The coin was light, sported special ridges on its rim for easy reading by_
_electronic vending machines and seemed tough to counterfeit._
_But the designers and bureaucrats were obviously so excited by their_
_creation that they ignored or refused to accept the new coin’s similar-_
_ity to the hundreds of millions of silver-colored, nickel-based half-franc_
_coins in circulation [whose] size and weight were perilously simi-_
_lar._ (Stanley Meisler. Copyright © 1986, _Los Angeles Times_ . Reprinted with


permission.)


The confusions probably occurred because the users of coins had
already formed representations in their memories that were only
sufficiently precise to distinguish among the coins that they were
accustomed to using. Psychological research suggests that people
maintain only partial descriptions of the things to be remembered.
In the three examples of new coins introduced in the United States,
Great Britain, and France, the descriptions formed to distinguish
among national currency were not precise enough to distinguish between a new coin and at least one of the old coins.


**80** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Suppose I keep all my notes in a small red notebook. If this is
my only notebook, I can describe it simply as “my notebook.” If I
buy several more notebooks, the earlier description will no longer
work. Now I must identify the first one as small or red, or maybe both
small and red, whichever allows me to distinguish it from the others. But what if I acquire several small red notebooks? Now I must
find some other means of describing the first book, adding to the
richness of the description and to its ability to discriminate among
the several similar items. Descriptions need discriminate only
among the choices in front of me, but what works for one purpose
may not for another.
Not all similar-looking items cause confusion. In updating this
edition of the book, I searched to see whether there might be more
recent examples of coin confusions. I found this interesting item on
the website Wikicoins.com:


_Someday, a leading psychologist may weigh in on one of the perplexing_
_questions of our time: if the American public was constantly confusing_
_the Susan B. Anthony dollar with the roughly similar-sized quarter, how_
_come they weren’t also constantly confusing the $20 bill with the identi-_
_cal-sized $1 bill?_ (James A. Capp, “Susan B. Anthony Dollar,” at www.wiki


coins.com. Retrieved May 29, 2012)


Here is the answer. Why not any confusion? We learn to discriminate among things by looking for distinguishing features. In
the United States, size is one major way of distinguishing among
coins, but not among paper money. With paper money, all the bills
are the same size, so Americans ignore size and look at the printed
numbers and images. Hence, we often confuse similar-size American coins but only seldom confuse similar-size American bills.
But people who come from a country that uses size and color of
their paper money to distinguish among the amounts (for example, Great Britain or any country that uses the euro) have learned
to use size and color to distinguish among paper money and
therefore are invariably confused when dealing with bills from
the United States.


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **81**


More confirmatory evidence comes from the fact that although
long-term residents of Britain complained that they confused the
one-pound coin with the five-pence coin, newcomers (and children) did not have the same confusion. This is because the longterm residents were working with their original set of descriptions,
which did not easily accommodate the distinctions between these
two coins. Newcomers, however, started off with no preconceptions and therefore formed a set of descriptions to distinguish
among all the coins; in this situation, the one-pound coin offered
no particular problem. In the United States, the Susan B. Anthony
dollar coin never became popular and is no longer being made, so
the equivalent observations cannot be made.
What gets confused depends heavily upon history: the aspects
that have allowed us to distinguish among the objects in the past.
When the rules for discrimination change, people can become confused and make errors. With time, they will adjust and learn to
discriminate just fine and may even forget the initial period of confusion. The problem is that in many circumstances, especially one
as politically charged as the size, shape, and color of currency, the
public’s outrage prevents calm discussion and does not allow for
any adjustment time.
Consider this as an example of design principles interacting with
the messy practicality of the real world. What appears good in principle can sometimes fail when introduced to the world. Sometimes,
bad products succeed and good products fail. The world is complex.


**CONSTRAINTS SIMPLIFY MEMORY**


Before widespread literacy, and especially before the advent of
sound recording devices, performers traveled from village to village, reciting epic poems thousands of lines long. This tradition
still exists in some societies. How do people memorize such voluminous amounts of material? Do some people have huge amounts
of knowledge in their heads? Not really. It turns out that external
constraints exert control over the permissible choice of words, thus
dramatically reducing the memory load. One of the secrets comes
from the powerful constraints of poetry.


**82** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Consider the constraints of rhyming. If you wish to rhyme one
word with another, there are usually a lot of alternatives. But if
you must have a word with a particular meaning to rhyme with
another, the joint constraints of meaning and rhyme can cause a
dramatic reduction in the number of possible candidates, sometimes reducing a large set to a single choice. Sometimes there are
no candidates at all. This is why it is much easier to memorize
poetry than to create poems. Poems come in many different forms,
but all have formal restrictions on their construction. The ballads

and tales told by the traveling storytellers used multiple poetic
constraints, including rhyme, rhythm, meter, assonance, alliteration, and onomatopoeia, while also remaining consistent with the
story being told.
Consider these two examples:


_One. I am thinking of three words: one means “a mythical being,”_
_the second is “the name of a building material,” and the third is “a unit_
_of time.” What words do I have in mind?_
_Two. This time look for rhyming words. I am thinking of three_
_words: one rhymes with “post,” the second with “eel,” and the third_
_with “ear.” What words am I thinking of?_ _(_ From Rubin & Wallace, 1989.)


In both examples, even though you might have found answers, they
were not likely to be the same three that I had in mind. There simply are not enough constraints. But suppose I now tell you that the
words I seek are the same in both tasks: What is a word that means

a mythical being and rhymes with “post”? What word is the name
of a building material and rhymes with “eel”? And what word is a
unit of time and rhymes with “ear”? Now the task is easy: the joint
specification of the words completely constrains the selection. When
the psychologists David Rubin and Wanda Wallace studied these
examples in their laboratory, people almost never got the correct
meanings or rhymes for the first two tasks, but most people correctly
answered, “ghost,” “steel,” and “year” in the combined task.
The classic study of memory for epic poetry was done by Albert
Bates Lord. In the mid-1900s he traveled throughout the former


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **83**


Yugoslavia (now a number of separate, independent countries)
and found people who still followed the oral tradition. He demonstrated that the “singer of tales,” the person who learns epic poems
and goes from village to village reciting them, is really re-creating
them, composing poetry on the fly in such a way that it obeys the
rhythm, theme, story line, structure, and other characteristics of
the poem. This is a prodigious feat, but it is not an example of rote

memory.
The power of multiple constraints allows one singer to listen to
another singer tell a lengthy tale once, and then after a delay of
a few hours or a day, to recite “the same song, word for word,
and line for line.” In fact, as Lord points out, the original and new
recitations are not the same word for word, but both teller and
listener perceive them as the same, even when the second version
was twice as long as the first. They are the same in the ways that
matter to the listener: they tell the same story, express the same
ideas, and follow the same rhyme and meter. They are the same in
all senses that matter to the culture. Lord shows just how the combination of memory for poetics, theme, and style combines with
cultural structures into what he calls a “formula” for producing a
poem perceived as identical to earlier recitations.
The notion that someone should be able to recite word for word

is relatively modern. Such a notion can be held only after printed
texts become available; otherwise who could judge the accuracy of
a recitation? Perhaps more important, who would care?
All this is not to detract from the feat. Learning and reciting an
epic poem, such as Homer’s _Odyssey_ and _Iliad,_ is clearly difficult
even if the singer is re-creating it: there are twenty-seven thousand
lines of verse in the combined written version. Lord points out that
this length is excessive, probably produced only during the special circumstances in which Homer (or some other singer) dictated
the story slowly and repetitively to the person who first wrote it
down. Normally the length would be varied to accommodate the
whims of the audience, and no normal audience could sit through
twenty-seven thousand lines. But even at one-third the size, nine
thousand lines, being able to recite the poem is impressive: at one


**84** _The Design of Everyday Things_


second per line, the verses would take two and one-half hours to
recite. It is impressive even allowing for the fact that the poem is
re-created as opposed to memorized, because neither the singer
nor the audience expect word-for-word accuracy (nor would either
have any way of verifying that).
Most of us do not learn epic poems. But we do make use of strong
constraints that serve to simplify what must be retained in memory.
Consider an example from a completely different domain: taking
apart and reassembling a mechanical device. Typical items in the
home that an adventuresome person might attempt to repair include a door lock, toaster, and washing machine. The device is apt
to have tens of parts. What has to be remembered to be able to put
the parts together again in a proper order? Not as much as might
appear from an initial analysis. In the extreme case, if there are ten
parts, there are 10! (ten factorial) different ways in which to reassemble them—a little over 3.5 million alternatives.

But few of these possibilities are possible: there are numerous
physical constraints on the ordering. Some pieces must be assembled before it is even possible to assemble the others. Some pieces
are physically constrained from fitting into the spots reserved for
others: bolts must fit into holes of an appropriate diameter and
depth; nuts and washers must be paired with bolts and screws
of appropriate sizes; and washers must always be put on before
nuts. There are even cultural constraints: we turn screws clock
wise to tighten, counterclockwise to loosen; the heads of screws
tend to go on the visible part (front or top) of a piece, bolts on the
less visible part (bottom, side, or interior); wood screws and machine screws look different and are inserted into different kinds

of materials. In the end, the apparently large number of decisions
is reduced to only a few choices that should have been learned
or otherwise noted during the disassembly. The constraints by
themselves are often not sufficient to determine the proper reassembly of the device—mistakes do get made—but the constraints
reduce the amount that must be learned to a reasonable quantity.
Constraints are powerful tools for the designer: they are examined in detail in Chapter 4.
