**The System Image**


People create mental models of themselves, others, the environment, and the things with which they interact. These are conceptual models formed through experience, training, and instruction.
These models serve as guides to help achieve our goals and in understanding the world.
How do we form an appropriate conceptual model for the devices we interact with? We cannot talk to the designer, so we rely
upon whatever information is available to us: what the device
looks like, what we know from using similar things in the past,
what was told to us in the sales literature, by salespeople and advertisements, by articles we may have read, by the product website
and instruction manuals. I call the combined information available

to us the _system image_ . When the system image is incoherent or inappropriate, as in the case of the refrigerator, then the user cannot
easily use the device. If it is incomplete or contradictory, there will
be trouble.

As illustrated in Figure 1.11, the designer of the product and the
person using the product form somewhat disconnected vertices of
a triangle. The designer’s conceptual model is the designer’s conception of the product, occupying one vertex of the triangle. The
product itself is no longer with the designer, so it is isolated as a
second vertex, perhaps sitting on the user’s kitchen counter. The
system image is what can be perceived from the physical structure that has been built (including documentation, instructions,
signifiers, and any information available from websites and help
lines). The user’s conceptual model comes from the system image,
through interaction with the product, reading, searching for online
information, and from whatever manuals are provided. The designer expects the user’s model to be identical to the design model,
but because designers cannot communicate directly with users, the
entire burden of communication is on the system image.

**age.** The designer’s conceptual model is
the designer’s conception of the look, feel,
and operation of a product. The system
image is what can be derived from the
physical structure that has been built
(including documentation). The user’s
mental model is developed through interaction with the product and the system
image. Designers expect the user’s model
to be identical to their own, but because
they cannot communicate directly with
the user, the burden of communication is
with the system image.


Figure 1.11 indicates why communication is such an important
aspect of good design. No matter how brilliant the product, if people cannot use it, it will receive poor reviews. It is up to the designer to provide the appropriate information to make the product
understandable and usable. Most important is the provision of a
good conceptual model that guides the user when thing go wrong.
With a good conceptual model, people can figure out what has
happened and correct the things that went wrong. Without a good
model, they struggle, often making matters worse.
Good conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoyable products: good communication is the key to good conceptual
models.
