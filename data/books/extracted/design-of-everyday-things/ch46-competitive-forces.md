**Competitive Forces**


Today, manufacturers around the world compete with one another.
The competitive pressures are severe. After all, there are only a
few basic ways by which a manufacturer can compete: three of the
most important being price, features, and quality—unfortunately
often in that order of importance. Speed is important, lest some
other company get ahead in the rush for market presence. These
pressures make it difficult to follow the full, iterative process of
continual product improvement. Even relatively stable home products, such as automobiles, kitchen appliances, television sets, and
computers, face the multiple forces of a competitive market that
encourage the introduction of changes without sufficient testing
and refinement.

Here is a simple, real example. I am working with a new startup
company, developing an innovative line of cooking equipment.
The founders had some unique ideas, pushing the technology of
cooking far ahead of anything available for homes. We did numerous field tests, built numerous prototypes, and engaged a worldclass industrial designer. We modified the original product concept
several times, based on early feedback from potential users and

advice from industry experts. But just as we were about to commission the first production of a few hand-tooled working prototypes that could be shown to potential investors and customers (an
expensive proposition for the small self-funded company), other
companies started displaying similar concepts in the trade shows.
What? Did they steal the ideas? No, it’s what is called the _Zeit-_
_geist,_ a German word meaning “spirit of the time.” In other words,
the time was ripe, the ideas were “in the air.” The competition
emerged even before we had delivered our first product. What is
a small, startup company to do? It doesn’t have money to compete
with the large companies. It has to modify its ideas to keep ahead
of the competition and come up with a demonstration that excites
potential customers and wows potential investors and, more importantly, potential distributors of the product. It is the distributors
who are the real customers, not the people who eventually buy the
product in stores and use it in their homes. The example illustrates
the real business pressures on companies: the need for speed, the
concern about costs, the competition that may force the company
to change its offerings, and the need to satisfy several classes of
customers—investors, distributors, and, of course, the people who
will actually use the product. Where should the company focus its
limited resources? More user studies? Faster development? New,
unique features?
The same pressures that the startup faced also impact established
companies. But they have other pressures as well. Most products
have a development cycle of one to two years. In order to bring out
a new model every year, the design process for the new model has
to have started even before the previous model has been released
to customers. Moreover, mechanisms for collecting and feeding
back the experiences of customers seldom exist. In an earlier era,
there was close coupling between designers and users. Today, they
are separated by barriers. Some companies prohibit designers from
working with customers, a bizarre and senseless restriction. Why
would they do this? In part to prevent leaks of the new developments to the competition, but also in part because customers may

stop purchasing the current offerings if they are led to believe that
a new, more advanced item is soon to come. But even where there
are no such restrictions, the complexity of large organizations coupled with the relentless pressure to finish the product makes this
interaction difficult. Remember Norman’s Law of Chapter 6: The
day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule
and above budget.


**FEATURITIS: A DEADLY TEMPTATION**


In every successful product there lurks the carrier of an insidious
disease called “featuritis,” with its main symptom being “creeping featurism.” The disease seems to have been first identified and
named in 1976, but its origins probably go back to the earliest technologies, buried far back in the eons prior to the dawn of history.
It seems unavoidable, with no known prevention. Let me explain.
Suppose we follow all the principles in this book for a wonderful, human-centered product. It obeys all design principles. It overcomes people’s problems and fulfills some important needs. It is
attractive and easy to use and understand. As a result, suppose the
product is successful: many people buy it and tell their friends to
buy it. What could be wrong with this?
The problem is that after the product has been available for a
while, a number of factors inevitably appear, pushing the company
toward the addition of new features—toward creeping featurism.
These factors include:


   - Existing customers like the product, but express a wish for more features, more functions, more capability.

   - A competing company adds new features to its products, producing
competitive pressures to match that offering, but to do even more in
order to get ahead of the competition.

   - Customers are satisfied, but sales are declining because the market
is saturated: everyone who wants the product already has it. Time to
add wonderful enhancements that will cause people to want the new
model, to upgrade.

Featuritis is highly infectious. New products are invariably more
complex, more powerful, and different in size than the first release
of a product. You can see that tension playing out in music players,
mobile phones, and computers, especially on smart phones, tablets, and pads. Portable devices get smaller and smaller with each
release, despite the addition of more and more features (making
them ever more difficult to operate). Some products, such as automobiles, home refrigerators, television sets, and kitchen stoves,
also increase in complexity with each release, getting larger and
more powerful.
But whether the products get larger or smaller, each new edition
invariably has more features than the previous one. Featuritis is
an insidious disease, difficult to eradicate, impossible to vaccinate
against. It is easy for marketing pressures to insist upon the addition
of new features, but there is no call—or for that matter, budget—to
get rid of old, unneeded ones.
How do you know when you have encountered featuritis? By
its major symptom: creeping featurism. Want an example? Look
at Figure 7.1, which illustrates the changes that have overcome the
simple Lego motorcycle since my first encounter with it for the first
edition of this book. The original motorcycle (Figure 4.1 and Figure
7.1A) had only fifteen components and could be put together without any instructions: it had sufficient constraints that every piece
had a unique location and orientation. But now, as Figure 7.1B
shows, the same motorcycle has become bloated, with twenty-nine
pieces. I needed instructions.
Creeping featurism is the tendency to add to the number of features of a product, often extending the number beyond all reason.
There is no way that a product can remain usable and understandable by the time it has all of those special-purpose features that
have been added in over time.

In her book _Different_, Harvard professor Youngme Moon argues that it is this attempt to match the competition that causes all
products to be the same. When companies try to increase sales by
matching every feature of their competitors, they end up hurting
themselves. After all, when products from two companies match

**FIGURE 7.1.** **Featuritis Strikes Lego.** Figure A shows the original Lego Motorcycle
available in 1988 when I used it in the first edition of this book (on the left), next to the
2013 version (on the right). The old version had only fifteen pieces. No manual was
needed to put it together. For the new version, the box proudly proclaims “29 pieces.”
I could put the original version together without instructions. Figure B shows how far
I got with the new version before I gave up and had to consult the instruction sheet.
Why did Lego believe it had to change the motorcycle? Perhaps because featuritis
struck real police motorcycles, causing them to increase in size and complexity and
Lego felt that its toy needed to match the world. (Photographs by the author.)


feature by feature, there is no longer any reason for a customer to
prefer one over another. This is competition-driven design. Unfortunately, the mind-set of matching the competitor’s list of features
pervades many organizations. Even if the first versions of a product are well done, human-centered, and focused upon real needs,
it is the rare organization that is content to let a good product stay
untouched.

Most companies compare features with their competition to determine where they are weak, so they can strengthen those areas.
Wrong, argues Moon. A better strategy is to concentrate on areas
where they are stronger and to strengthen them even more. Then
focus all marketing and advertisements to point out the strong
points. This causes the product to stand out from the mindless
herd. As for the weaknesses, ignore the irrelevant ones, says Moon.
The lesson is simple: don’t follow blindly; focus on strengths, not
weaknesses. If the product has real strengths, it can afford to just
be “good enough” in the other areas.
Good design requires stepping back from competitive pressures
and ensuring that the entire product be consistent, coherent, and

understandable. This stance requires the leadership of the company to withstand the marketing forces that keep begging to add
this feature or that, each thought to be essential for some market
segment. The best products come from ignoring these competing
voices and instead focusing on the true needs of the people who
use the product.
Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, calls his approach “customer obsessed.” Everything is focused upon the requirements of Amazon’s customers. The competition is ignored,
the traditional marketing requirements are ignored. The focus is on
simple, customer-driven questions: what do the customers want;
how can their needs best be satisfied; what can be done better to

enhance customer service and customer value? Focus on the cus
tomer, Bezos argues, and the rest takes care of itself. Many companies claim to aspire to this philosophy, but few are able to follow
it. Usually it is only possible where the head of the company, the
CEO, is also the founder. Once the company passes control to others, especially those who follow the traditional MBA dictum of
putting profit above customer concerns, the story goes downhill.
Profits may indeed increase in the short term, but eventually the
product quality deteriorates to the point where customers desert.
Quality only comes about by continual focus on, and attention to,
the people who matter: customers.
