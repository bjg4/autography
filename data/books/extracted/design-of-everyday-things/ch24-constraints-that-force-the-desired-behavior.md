**Constraints That Force the Desired Behavior**


**FORCING FUNCTIONS**


Forcing functions are a form of physical constraint: situations in
which the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage prevents the next step from happening. Starting a car has a forcing
function associated with it—the driver must have some physical
object that signifies permission to use the car. In the past, it was a
physical key to unlock the car doors and also to be placed into the
ignition switch, which allowed the key to turn on the electrical system and, if rotated to its extreme position, to activate the engine.
Today’s cars have many means of verifying permission. Some still
require a key, but it can stay in one’s pocket or carrying case. More
and more, the key is not required and is replaced by a card, phone,
or some physical token that can communicate with the car. As long
as only authorized people have the card (which is, of course, the
same for keys), everything works fine. Electric or hybrid vehicles

do not need to start the engines prior to moving the car, but the
procedures are still similar: drivers must authenticate themselves
by having a physical item in their possession. Because the vehicle
won’t start without the authentication proved by possession of the
key, it is a forcing function.
Forcing functions are the extreme case of strong constraints that
can prevent inappropriate behavior. Not every situation allows
such strong constraints to operate, but the general principle can be
extended to a wide variety of situations. In the field of safety engineering, forcing functions show up under other names, in particular as specialized methods for the prevention of accidents. Three
such methods are interlocks, lock-ins, and lockouts.


**INTERLOCKS**


An interlock forces operations to take place in proper sequence.
Microwave ovens and devices with interior exposure to high voltage use interlocks as forcing functions to prevent people from
opening the door of the oven or disassembling the devices without
first turning off the electric power: the interlock disconnects the
power the instant the door is opened or the back is removed. In
automobiles with automatic transmissions, an interlock prevents
the transmission from leaving the Park position unless the car’s
brake pedal is depressed.
Another form of interlock is the “dead man’s switch” in nu
merous safety settings, especially for the operators of trains, lawn
mowers, chainsaws, and many recreational vehicles. In Britain,
these are called the “driver’s safety device.” Many require that the
operator hold down a spring-loaded switch to enable operation of
the equipment, so that if the operator dies (or loses control), the
switch will be released, stopping the equipment. Because some operators bypassed the feature by tying down the control (or placing
a heavy weight on foot-operated ones), various schemes have been
developed to determine that the person is really alive and alert.
Some require a midlevel of pressure; some, repeated depressions
and releases. Some require responses to queries. But in all cases,

to exit a program without either saving the work or consciously saying
not to. Notice that it is politely configured so that the desired operation
can be taken right from the message.


they are examples of safety-related interlocks to prevent operation
when the operator is incapacitated.


**LOCK-INS**


A lock-in keeps an operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it. Standard lock-ins exist on many computer
applications, where any attempt to exit the application without
saving work is prevented by a message prompt asking whether
that is what is really wanted (Figure 4. 6). These are so effective that
I use them deliberately as my standard way of exiting. Rather than
saving a file and then exiting the program, I simply exit, knowing
that I will be given a simple way to save my work. What was once
created as an error message has become an efficient shortcut.
Lock-ins can be quite literal, as in jail cells or playpens for babies,
preventing a person from leaving the area.
Some companies try to lock in customers by making all their
products work harmoniously with one another but be incompatible with the products of their competition. Thus music, videos, or
electronic books purchased from one company may be played or
read on music and video players and e-book readers made by that
company, but will fail with similar devices from other manufacturers. The goal is to use design as a business strategy: the consistency
within a given manufacturer means once people learn the system,
they will stay with it and hesitate to change. The confusion when
using a different company’s system further prevents customers from

**FIGURE 4.7.** **A Lockout Forcing Function for Fire Exit.**

fire from continuing into the basement areas, where they
might get trapped.


changing systems. In the end, the people who must use multiple
systems lose. Actually, everyone loses, except for the one manufacturer whose products dominate.


**LOCKOUTS**


Whereas a lock-in keeps someone in a space or prevents an action
until the desired operations have been done, a lockout prevents
someone from entering a space that is dangerous, or prevents an
event from occurring. A good example of a lockout is found in
stairways of public buildings, at least in the United States (Figure
4.7). In cases of fire, people have a tendency to flee in panic, down
the stairs, down, down, down, past the ground floor and into the
basement, where they might be trapped. The solution (required by
the fire laws) is not to allow simple passage from the ground floor
to the basement.

Lockouts are usually used for safety reasons. Thus, small children are protected by baby locks on cabinet doors, covers for electric outlets, and specialized caps on containers for drugs and toxic
substances. The pin that prevents a fire extinguisher from being
activated until it is removed is a lockout forcing function to prevent accidental discharge.

Forcing functions can be a nuisance in normal usage. The result
is that many people will deliberately disable the forcing function, thereby negating its safety feature. The clever designer has
to minimize the nuisance value while retaining the safety feature
of the forcing function that guards against the occasional tragedy.
The gate in Figure 4.7 is a clever compromise: sufficient restraint
to make people realize they are leaving the ground floor, but not
enough of an impediment to normal behavior that people will
prop open the gate.
Other useful devices make use of a forcing function. In some
public restrooms, a pull-down shelf is placed inconveniently on
the wall just behind the cubicle door, held in a vertical position by
a spring. You lower the shelf to the horizontal position, and the
weight of a package or handbag keeps it there. The shelf’s position
is a forcing function. When the shelf is lowered, it blocks the door
fully. So to get out of the cubicle, you have to remove whatever is
on the shelf and raise it out of the way. Clever design.
