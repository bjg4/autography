**People as Storytellers**


Now that we have explored the way that actions get done and the
three different levels of processing that integrate cognition and
emotion, we are ready to look at some of the implications.


**56** _The Design of Everyday Things_


People are innately disposed to look for causes of events, to form
explanations and stories. That is one reason storytelling is such
a persuasive medium. Stories resonate with our experiences and
provide examples of new instances. From our experiences and the
stories of others we tend to form generalizations about the way
people behave and things work. We attribute causes to events, and
as long as these cause-and-effect pairings make sense, we accept
them and use them for understanding future events. Yet these
causal attributions are often erroneous. Sometimes they implicate
the wrong causes, and for some things that happen, there is no
single cause; rather, a complex chain of events that all contribute
to the result: if any one of the events would not have occurred, the
result would be different. But even when there is no single causal
act, that doesn’t stop people from assigning one.
Conceptual models are a form of story, resulting from our predisposition to find explanations. These models are essential in helping
us understand our experiences, predict the outcome of our actions,
and handle unexpected occurrences. We base our models on whatever knowledge we have, real or imaginary, naive or sophisticated.
Conceptual models are often constructed from fragmentary evidence, with only a poor understanding of what is happening, and
with a kind of naive psychology that postulates causes, mechanisms, and relationships even where there are none. Some faulty
models lead to the frustrations of everyday life, as in the case of my
unsettable refrigerator, where my conceptual model of its operation (see again Figure 1.10A) did not correspond to reality (Figure
1.10B). Far more serious are faulty models of such complex systems as an industrial plant or passenger airplane. Misunderstanding there can lead to devastating accidents.
Consider the thermostat that controls room heating and cooling
systems. How does it work? The average thermostat offers almost
no evidence of its operation except in a highly roundabout manner. All we know is that if the room is too cold, we set a higher
temperature into the thermostat. Eventually we feel warmer. Note
that the same thing applies to the temperature control for almost
any device whose temperature is to be regulated. Want to bake a

cake? Set the oven thermostat and the oven goes to the desired
temperature.
If you are in a cold room, in a hurry to get warm, will the room
heat more quickly if you turn the thermostat to its maximum setting? Or if you want the oven to reach its working temperature
faster, should you turn the temperature dial all the way to maximum, then turn it down once the desired temperature is reached?
Or to cool a room most quickly, should you set the air conditioner
thermostat to its lowest temperature setting?
If you think that the room or oven will cool or heat faster if the
thermostat is turned all the way to the maximum setting, you are
wrong—you hold an erroneous folk theory of the heating and cooling system. One commonly held folk theory of the working of a
thermostat is that it is like a valve: the thermostat controls how

much heat (or cold) comes out of the device. Hence, to heat or cool
something most quickly, set the thermostat so that the device is on
maximum. The theory is reasonable, and there exist devices that
operate like this, but neither the heating or cooling equipment for a
home nor the heating element of a traditional oven is one of them.
In most homes, the thermostat is just an on-off switch. Moreover,
most heating and cooling devices are either fully on or fully off:
all or nothing, with no in-between states. As a result, the thermostat turns the heater, oven, or air conditioner completely on, at full
power, until the temperature setting on the thermostat is reached.
Then it turns the unit completely off. Setting the thermostat at
one extreme cannot affect how long it takes to reach the desired
temperature. Worse, because this bypasses the automatic shutoff
when the desired temperature is reached, setting it at the extremes
invariably means that the temperature overshoots the target. If
people were uncomfortably cold or hot before, they will become
uncomfortable in the other direction, wasting considerable energy
in the process.
But how are you to know? What information helps you understand how the thermostat works? The design problem with the
refrigerator is that there are no aids to understanding, no way of

forming the correct conceptual model. In fact, the information
provided misleads people into forming the wrong, quite inappropriate model.
The real point of these examples is not that some people have erroneous beliefs; it is that everyone forms stories (conceptual models) to explain what they have observed. In the absence of external
information, people can let their imagination run free as long as
the conceptual models they develop account for the facts as they
perceive them. As a result, people use their thermostats inappropriately, causing themselves unnecessary effort, and often resulting
in large temperature swings, thus wasting energy, which is both a
needless expense and bad for the environment. (Later in this chapter, page 69, I provide an example of a thermostat that does provide a useful conceptual model.)
