**Design Principles for Dealing with Error**


People are flexible, versatile, and creative. Machines are rigid, precise, and relatively fixed in their operations. There is a mismatch
between the two, one that can lead to enhanced capability if used
properly. Think of an electronic calculator. It doesn’t do mathematics like a person, but can solve problems people can’t. Moreover,
calculators do not make errors. So the human plus calculator is a
perfect collaboration: we humans figure out what the important
problems are and how to state them. Then we use calculators to
compute the solutions.
Difficulties arise when we do not think of people and machines
as collaborative systems, but assign whatever tasks can be automated to the machines and leave the rest to people. This ends up
requiring people to behave in machine like fashion, in ways that
differ from human capabilities. We expect people to monitor machines, which means keeping alert for long periods, something we
are bad at. We require people to do repeated operations with the
extreme precision and accuracy required by machines, again something we are not good at. When we divide up the machine and
human components of a task in this way, we fail to take advantage
of human strengths and capabilities but instead rely upon areas
where we are genetically, biologically unsuited. Yet, when people
fail, they are blamed.
What we call “human error” is often simply a human action that
is inappropriate for the needs of technology. As a result, it flags a
deficit in our technology. It should not be thought of as error. We
should eliminate the concept of error: instead, we should realize
that people can use assistance in translating their goals and plans
into the appropriate form for technology.
Given the mismatch between human competencies and technological requirements, errors are inevitable. Therefore, the best
designs take that fact as given and seek to minimize the opportunities for errors while also mitigating the consequences. Assume
that every possible mishap will happen, so protect against them.
Make actions reversible; make errors less costly. Here are key design principles:

   - Put the knowledge required to operate the technology in the world.
Don’t require that all the knowledge must be in the head. Allow for
efficient operation when people have learned all the requirements,
when they are experts who can perform without the knowledge in
the world, but make it possible for non-experts to use the knowledge
in the world. This will also help experts who need to perform a rare,
infrequently performed operation or return to the technology after a
prolonged absence.

    - Use the power of natural and artificial constraints: physical, logical,
semantic, and cultural. Exploit the power of forcing functions and
natural mappings.

   - Bridge the two gulfs, the Gulf of Execution and the Gulf of Evaluation. Make things visible, both for execution and evaluation. On the
execution side, provide feedforward information: make the options
readily available. On the evaluation side, provide feedback: make the
results of each action apparent. Make it possible to determine the system’s status readily, easily, accurately, and in a form consistent with
the person’s goals, plans, and expectations.


We should deal with error by embracing it, by seeking to understand the causes and ensuring they do not happen again. We need
to assist rather than punish or scold.

###### DESIGN THINKING

One of my rules in consulting is simple: never solve the
problem I am asked to solve. Why such a counterintuitive rule? Because, invariably, the problem I am asked
to solve is not the real, fundamental, root problem. It
is usually a symptom. Just as in Chapter 5, where the solution to
accidents and errors was to determine the real, underlying cause
of the events, in design, the secret to success is to understand what

It is amazing how often people solve the problem before them
without bothering to question it. In my classes of graduate students
in both engineering and business, I like to give them a problem to
solve on the first day of class and then listen the next week to their
wonderful solutions. They have masterful analyses, drawings, and
illustrations. The MBA students show spreadsheets in which they
have analyzed the demographics of the potential customer base.
They show lots of numbers: costs, sales, margins, and profits. The
engineers show detailed drawings and specifications. It is all well

When all the presentations are over, I congratulate them, but
ask: “How do you know you solved the correct problem?” They
are puzzled. Engineers and business people are trained to solve

are puzzled. Engineers and business people are trained to solve


problems. Why would anyone ever give them the wrong problem?
“Where do you think the problems come from?” I ask. The real
world is not like the university. In the university, professors make
up artificial problems. In the real world, the problems do not come
in nice, neat packages. They have to be discovered. It is all too easy
to see only the surface problems and never dig deeper to address
the real issues.
