**Social and Institutional Pressures**


A subtle issue that seems to figure in many accidents is social pressure. Although at first it may not seem relevant to design, it has
strong influence on everyday behavior. In industrial settings, social
pressures can lead to misinterpretation, mistakes, and accidents. To
understand human error, it is essential to understand social pressure.
Complex problem-solving is required when one is faced with
knowledge-based problems. In some cases, it can take teams of people days to understand what is wrong and the best ways to respond.
This is especially true of situations where mistakes have been made
in the diagnosis of the problem. Once the mistaken diagnosis is
made, all information from then on is interpreted from the wrong
point of view. Appropriate reconsiderations might only take place
during team turnover, when new people come into the situation
with a fresh viewpoint, allowing them to form different interpretations of the events. Sometimes just asking one or more of the team
members to take a few hours’ break can lead to the same fresh anal
ysis (although it is understandably difficult to convince someone
who is battling an emergency situation to stop for a few hours).
In commercial installations, the pressure to keep systems running is immense. Considerable money might be lost if an expensive system is shut down. Operators are often under pressure not
to do this. The result has at times been tragic. Nuclear power plants
are kept running longer than is safe. Airplanes have taken off before everything was ready and before the pilots had received permission. One such incident led to the largest accident in aviation
history. Although the incident happened in 1977, a long time ago,
the lessons learned are still very relevant today.
In Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, a KLM Boeing 747 crashed
during takeoff into a Pan American 747 that was taxiing on the
same runway, killing 583 people. The KLM plane had not received
clearance to take off, but the weather was starting to get bad and
the crew had already been delayed for too long (even being on the


**186** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Canary Islands was a diversion from the scheduled flight—bad
weather had prevented their landing at their scheduled destination). And the Pan American flight should not have been on the
runway, but there was considerable misunderstanding between
the pilots and the air traffic controllers. Furthermore, the fog was
coming in so thickly that neither plane’s crew could see the other.
In the Tenerife disaster, time and economic pressures were acting
together with cultural and weather conditions. The Pan American
pilots questioned their orders to taxi on the runway, but they continued anyway. The first officer of the KLM flight voiced minor
objections to the captain, trying to explain that they were not yet
cleared for takeoff (but the first officer was very junior to the captain, who was one of KLM’s most respected pilots). All in all, a major tragedy occurred due to a complex mixture of social pressures
and logical explaining away of discrepant observations.
You may have experienced similar pressure, putting off refueling or recharging your car until it was too late and you ran out,
sometimes in a truly inconvenient place (this has happened to me).
What are the social pressures to cheat on school examinations, or
to help others cheat? Or to not report cheating by others? Never
underestimate the power of social pressures on behavior, causing
otherwise sensible people to do things they know are wrong and
possibly dangerous.
When I was in training to do underwater (scuba) diving, our instructor was so concerned about this that he said he would reward

anyone who stopped a dive early in favor of safety. People are normally buoyant, so they need weights to get them beneath the surface.
When the water is cold, the problem is intensified because divers
must then wear either wet or dry suits to keep warm, and these
suits add buoyancy. Adjusting buoyancy is an important part of
the dive, so along with the weights, divers also wear air vests
into which they continually add or remove air so that the body is
close to neutral buoyancy. (As divers go deeper, increased water
pressure compresses the air in their protective suits and lungs, so
they become heavier: the divers need to add air to their vests to
compensate.)

When divers have gotten into difficulties and needed to get
to the surface quickly, or when they were at the surface close to
shore but being tossed around by waves, some drowned because
they were still being encumbered by their heavy weights. Because the
weights are expensive, the divers didn’t want to release them. In
addition, if the divers released the weights and then made it back
safely, they could never prove that the release of the weights was
necessary, so they would feel embarrassed, creating self-induced
social pressure. Our instructor was very aware of the resulting reluctance of people to take the critical step of releasing their weights
when they weren’t entirely positive it was necessary. To counteract
this tendency, he announced that if anyone dropped the weights
for safety reasons, he would publicly praise the diver and replace
the weights at no cost to the person. This was a very persuasive
attempt to overcome social pressures.
Social pressures show up continually. They are usually difficult
to document because most people and organizations are reluctant
to admit these factors, so even if they are discovered in the process
of the accident investigation, the results are often kept hidden from
public scrutiny. A major exception is in the study of transportation
accidents, where the review boards across the world tend to hold
open investigations. The US National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) is an excellent example of this, and its reports are widely
used by many accident investigators and researchers of human error (including me).
Another good example of social pressures comes from yet another airplane incident. In 1982 an Air Florida flight from National
Airport, Washington, DC, crashed during takeoff into the Fourteenth Street Bridge over the Potomac River, killing seventy-eight
people, including four who were on the bridge. The plane should
not have taken off because there was ice on the wings, but it had already been delayed for over an hour and a half; this and other factors, the NTSB reported, “may have predisposed the crew to hurry.”
The accident occurred despite the first officer’s attempt to warn
the captain, who was flying the airplane (the captain and first
officer—sometimes called the copilot—usually alternate flying


**188** _The Design of Everyday Things_


roles on different legs of a trip). The NTSB report quotes the flight
deck recorder’s documenting that “although the first officer expressed concern that something ‘was not right’ to the captain four
times during the takeoff, the captain took no action to reject the
takeoff.” NTSB summarized the causes this way:


_The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable_
_cause of this accident was the flight crew’s failure to use engine anti-_
_ice during ground operation and takeoff, their decision to take off with_
_snow/ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft, and the captain’s failure_
_to reject the takeoff during the early stage when his attention was called_
_to anomalous engine instrument readings._ (NTSB, 1982.)


Again we see social pressures coupled with time and economic
forces.

Social pressures can be overcome, but they are powerful and pervasive. We drive when drowsy or after drinking, knowing full well
the dangers, but talking ourselves into believing that we are exempt. How can we overcome these kinds of social problems? Good
design alone is not sufficient. We need different training; we need
to reward safety and put it above economic pressures. It helps if
the equipment can make the potential dangers visible and explicit,
but this is not always possible. To adequately address social, economic, and cultural pressures and to improve upon company policies are the hardest parts of ensuring safe operation and behavior.


**CHECKLISTS**


Checklists are powerful tools, proven to increase the accuracy of
behavior and to reduce error, particularly slips and memory lapses.
They are especially important in situations with multiple, complex
requirements, and even more so where there are interruptions.
With multiple people involved in a task, it is essential that the lines
of responsibility be clearly spelled out. It is always better to have
two people do checklists together as a team: one to read the instruction, the other to execute it. If, instead, a single person executes
the checklist and then, later, a second person checks the items, the


five: _Human Error? No, Bad Design_ **189**


results are not as robust. The person following the checklist, feeling confident that any errors would be caught, might do the steps
too quickly. But the same bias affects the checker. Confident in the
ability of the first person, the checker often does a quick, less than
thorough job.
One paradox of groups is that quite often, adding more people
to check a task makes it less likely that it will be done right. Why?
Well, if you were responsible for checking the correct readings on
a row of fifty gauges and displays, but you know that two people before you had checked them and that one or two people who
come after you will check your work, you might relax, thinking
that you don’t have to be extra careful. After all, with so many
people looking, it would be impossible for a problem to exist without detection. But if everyone thinks the same way, adding more
checks can actually increase the chance of error. A collaboratively
followed checklist is an effective way to counteract these natural
human tendencies.

In commercial aviation, collaboratively followed checklists are
widely accepted as essential tools for safety. The checklist is done
by two people, usually the two pilots of the airplane (the captain
and first officer). In aviation, checklists have proven their worth
and are now required in all US commercial flights. But despite the
strong evidence confirming their usefulness, many industries still
fiercely resist them. It makes people feel that their competence is
being questioned. Moreover, when two people are involved, a junior person (in aviation, the first officer) is being asked to watch
over the action of the senior person. This is a strong violation of the
lines of authority in many cultures.
Physicians and other medical professionals have strongly resisted
the use of checklists. It is seen as an insult to their professional
competence. “Other people might need checklists,” they complain,
“but not me.” Too bad. Too err is human: we all are subject to slips
and mistakes when under stress, or under time or social pressure,
or after being subjected to multiple interruptions, each essential
in its own right. It is not a threat to professional competence to be


**190** _The Design of Everyday Things_


human. Legitimate criticisms of particular checklists are used as an
indictment against the concept of checklists. Fortunately, checklists
are slowly starting to gain acceptance in medical situations. When
senior personnel insist on the use of checklists, it actually enhances
their authority and professional status. It took decades for checklists to be accepted in commercial aviation: let us hope that medicine and other professions will change more rapidly.
Designing an effective checklist is difficult. The design needs to be
iterative, always being refined, ideally using the human-centered
design principles of Chapter 6, continually adjusting the list until it
covers the essential items yet is not burdensome to perform. Many
people who object to checklists are actually objecting to badly designed lists: designing a checklist for a complex task is best done by
professional designers in conjunction with subject matter experts.
Printed checklists have one major flaw: they force the steps to
follow a sequential ordering, even where this is not necessary or
even possible. With complex tasks, the order in which many operations are performed may not matter, as long as they are all completed. Sometimes items early in the list cannot be done at the time
they are encountered in the checklist. For example, in aviation one
of the steps is to check the amount of fuel in the plane. But what if
the fueling operation has not yet been completed when this checklist item is encountered? Pilots will skip over it, intending to come
back to it after the plane has been refueled. This is a clear opportunity for a memory-lapse error.
In general, it is bad design to impose a sequential structure to task
execution unless the task itself requires it. This is one of the major benefits of electronic checklists: they can keep track of skipped
items and can ensure that the list will not be marked as complete
until all items have been done.
