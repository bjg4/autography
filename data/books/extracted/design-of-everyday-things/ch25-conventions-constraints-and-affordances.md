**Conventions, Constraints, and Affordances**


In Chapter 1 we learned of the distinctions between affordances,
perceived affordances, and signifiers. Affordances refer to the potential actions that are possible, but these are easily discoverable
only if they are perceivable: perceived affordances. It is the signifier component of the perceived affordance that allows people
to determine the possible actions. But how does one go from the
perception of an affordance to understanding the potential action?
In many cases, through conventions.
A doorknob has the perceived affordance of graspability. But
knowing that it is the doorknob that is used to open and close
doors is learned: it is a cultural aspect of the design that knobs,
handles, and bars, when placed on doors, are intended to enable
the opening and shutting of those doors. The same devices on
fixed walls would have a different interpretation: they might offer
support, for example, but certainly not the possibility of opening
the wall. The interpretation of a perceived affordance is a cultural

convention.

**CONVENTIONS ARE CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS**


Conventions are a special kind of cultural constraint. For example, the means by which people eat is subject to strong cultural
constraints and conventions. Different cultures use different eat
ing utensils. Some eat primarily with the fingers and bread. Some
use elaborate serving devices. The same is true of almost every
aspect of behavior imaginable, from the clothes that are worn;
to the way one addresses elders, equals, and inferiors; and even
to the order in which people enter or exit a room. What is considered correct and proper in one culture may be considered impolite in another.

Although conventions provide valuable guidance for novel situations, their existence can make it difficult to enact change: consider the story of destination-control elevators.


**WHEN CONVENTIONS CHANGE:**

**THE CASE OF DESTINATION-CONTROL ELEVATORS**


_Operating the common elevator seems like a no-brainer. Press the but-_
_ton, get in the box, go up or down, get out. But we’ve been encountering_
_and documenting an array of curious design variations on this simple_
_interaction, raising the question: Why?_ (From Portigal & Norvaisas, 2011.)


This quotation comes from two design professionals who were
so offended by a change in the controls for an elevator system that
they wrote an entire article of complaint.
What could possibly cause such an offense? Was it really bad design or, as the authors suggest, a completely unnecessary change to
an otherwise satisfactory system? Here is what happened: the authors had encountered a new convention for elevators called “Ele
vator Destination Control.” Many people (including me) consider
it superior to the one we are all used to. Its major disadvantage is
that it is different. It violates customary convention. Violations of
convention can be very disturbing. Here is the history.
When “modern” elevators were first installed in buildings in
the late 1800s, they always had a human operator who controlled
the speed and direction of the elevator, stopped at the appropri

**146** _The Design of Everyday Things_


ate floors, and opened and shut the doors. People would enter the
elevator, greet the operator, and state which floor they wished to
travel to. When the elevators became automated, a similar convention was followed. People entered the elevator and told the
elevator what floor they were traveling to by pushing the appropriately marked button inside the elevator.
This is a pretty inefficient way of doing things. Most of you have
probably experienced a crowded elevator where every person
seems to want to go to a different floor, which means a slow trip for
the people going to the higher floors. A destination-control elevator system groups passengers, so that those going to the same floor
are asked to use the same elevator and the passenger load is distributed to maximize efficiency. Although this kind of grouping
is only sensible for buildings that have a large number of elevators,
that would cover any large hotel, office, or apartment building.
In the traditional elevator, passengers stand in the elevator hallway and indicate whether they wish to travel up or down. When an
elevator arrives going in the appropriate direction, they get in and
use the keypad inside the elevator to indicate their destination
floor. As a result, five people might get into the same elevator each
wanting a different floor. With destination control, the destination
keypads are located in the hallway outside the elevators and there
are no keypads inside the elevators (Figure 4.8A and D). People
are directed to whichever elevator will most efficiently reach their
floor. Thus, if there were five people desiring elevators, they might
be assigned to five different elevators. The result is faster trips for
everyone, with a minimum of stops. Even if people are assigned to
elevators that are not the next to arrive, they will get to their destinations faster than if they took earlier elevators.
Destination control was invented in 1985, but the first commercial installation didn’t appear until 1990 (in Schindler elevators).
Now, decades later, it is starting to appear more frequently as developers of tall buildings discover that destination control yields
better service to passengers, or equal service with fewer elevators.
Horrors! As Figure 4.8D confirms, there are no controls inside the
elevator to specify a floor. What if passengers change their minds

**C.**


**D.**


**FIGURE 4.8.** **Destination-Control Elevators.** In a destinationcontrol system, the desired destination floor is entered into the control
panel outside the elevators (A and B). After entering the destination
floor into B, the display directs the traveler to the appropriate elevator,
as shown in C, where “32” has been entered as the desired floor destination, and the person is directed to elevator “L” (the first elevator on the
left, in A). There is no way to specify the floor from inside the elevator:
Inside, the controls are only to open and shut the doors and an alarm (D).
This is a much more efficient design, but confusing to people used to the
more conventional system. (Photographs by the author.)

and wish to get off at a different floor? (Even my editor at Basic
Books complained about this in a marginal note.) What then? What
do you do in a regular elevator when you decide you really want
to get off at the sixth floor just as the elevator passes the seventh
floor? It’s simple: just get off at the next stop and go to the destination control box in the elevator hall, and specify the intended floor.


**PEOPLE’S RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN CONVENTIONS**


People invariably object and complain whenever a new approach
is introduced into an existing array of products and systems. Conventions are violated: new learning is required. The merits of the
new system are irrelevant: it is the change that is upsetting. The
destination control elevator is only one of many such examples.
The metric system provides a powerful example of the difficulties
in changing people’s conventions.
The metric scale of measurement is superior to the English scale
of units in almost every dimension: it is logical, easy to learn,
and easy to use in computations. Today, over two centuries have
passed since the metric system was developed by the French in
the 1790s, yet three countries still resist its use: the United States,
Liberia, and Myanmar. Even Great Britain has mostly switched, so
the only major country left that uses the older English system of
units is the United States. Why haven’t we switched? The change
is too upsetting for the people who have to learn the new system,
and the initial cost of purchasing new tools and measuring devices
seems excessive. The learning difficulties are nowhere as complex
as purported, and the cost would be relatively small because the
metric system is already in wide use, even in the United States.
Consistency in design is virtuous. It means that lessons learned
with one system transfer readily to others. On the whole, consistency is to be followed. If a new way of doing things is only slightly
better than the old, it is better to be consistent. But if there is to be
a change, everybody has to change. Mixed systems are confusing
to everyone. When a new way of doing things is vastly superior
to another, then the merits of change outweigh the difficulty of

change. Just because something is different does not mean it is bad.
If we only kept to the old, we could never improve.


**The Faucet:**

**A Case History of Design**


It may be hard to believe that an everyday water faucet could need
an instruction manual. I saw one, this time at the meeting of the
British Psychological Society in Sheffield, England. The participants were lodged in dormitories. Upon checking into Ranmoor
House, each guest was given a pamphlet that provided useful information: where the churches were, the times of meals, the location of
the post office, and how to work the taps (faucets). “The taps on the
washhand basin are operated by pushing down gently.”
When it was my turn to speak at the conference, I asked the audience about those taps. How many had trouble using them? Polite,
restrained tittering from the audience. How many tried to turn the
handle? A large show of hands. How many had to seek help? A few
honest folks raised their hands. Afterward, one woman came up to
me and said that she had given up and walked the halls until she
found someone who could explain the taps to her. A simple sink, a
simple-looking faucet. But it looks as if it should be turned, not
pushed. If you want the faucet to be pushed, make it look as if it
should be pushed. (This, of course, is similar to the problem I had
emptying the water from the sink in my hotel, described in Chapter 1.)
Why is such a simple, standard item as a water faucet so difficult to get right? The person using a faucet cares about two things:
water temperature and rate of flow. But water enters the faucet
through two pipes, hot and cold. There is a conflict between the
human need for temperature and flow and the physical structure
of hot and cold.

There are several ways to deal with this:


   - **Control both hot and cold water:** Two controls, one for hot water,

the other cold.

   - **Control only temperature:** One control, where rate of flow is fixed.
Rotating the control from its fixed position turns on the water at


**150** _The Design of Everyday Things_


some predetermined rate of flow, with the temperature controlled by
the knob position.

 - **Control only amount:** One control, where temperature is fixed, with
rate of flow controlled by the knob position.

 - **On-off.** One control turns the water on and off. This is how gesturecontrolled faucets work: moving the hand under or away from
the spout turns the water on or off, at a fixed temperature and rate

of flow.

 - **Control temperature and rate of flow.** Use two separate controls, one
for water temperature, the other for flow rate. (I have never encountered this solution.)

 - **One control for temperature and rate:** Have one integrated control, where movement in one direction controls the temperature and

movement in a different direction controls the amount.


Where there are two controls, one for hot water and one for cold,
there are four mapping problems;


 - Which knob controls the hot, which the cold?

 - How do you change the temperature without affecting the rate of

flow?

 - How do you change the flow without affecting the temperature?

 - Which direction increases water flow?


The mapping problems are solved through cultural conventions,
or constraints. It is a worldwide convention that the left faucet

should be hot; the right, cold. It is also a universal convention that
screw threads are made to tighten with clockwise turning, loosen
with counterclockwise. You turn off a faucet by tightening a screw
thread (tightening a washer against its seat), thereby shutting off
the flow of water. So clockwise turning shuts off the water, counterclockwise turns it on.

Unfortunately, the constraints do not always hold. Most of
the English people I asked were not aware that left/hot, right/
cold was a convention; it is violated too often to be considered a
convention in England. But the convention isn’t universal in the


four: _Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback_ **151**


United States, either. I once experienced shower controls that were
placed vertically: Which one controlled the hot water, the top faucet or the bottom?

If the two faucet handles are round knobs, clockwise rotation

of either should decrease volume. However, if each faucet has a
single “blade” as its handle, then people don’t think they are rotating the handles: they think that they are pushing or pulling. To
maintain consistency, pulling either faucet should increase volume,
even though this means rotating the left faucet counterclockwise
and the right one clockwise. Although rotation direction is inconsistent, pulling and pushing is consistent, which is how people
conceptualize their actions.
Alas, sometimes clever people are too clever for our good. Some
well-meaning plumbing designers have decided that consistency
should be ignored in favor of their own, private brand of psychology. The human body has mirror-image symmetry, say these
pseudo-psychologists. So if the left hand moves clockwise, why,
the right hand should move counterclockwise. Watch out, your
plumber or architect may install a bathroom fixture whose clockwise rotation has a different result with the hot water than with

the cold.

As you try to control the water temperature, soap running down
over your eyes, groping to change the water control with one hand,
soap or shampoo clutched in the other, you are guaranteed to get it
wrong. If the water is too cold, the groping hand is just as likely to
make the water colder as to make it scalding hot.
Whoever invented that mirror-image nonsense should be forced
to take a shower. Yes, there is some logic to it. To be a bit fair to
the inventor of the scheme, it works as long as you always use
two hands to adjust both faucets simultaneously. It fails miserably, however, when one hand is used to alternate between the two
controls. Then you cannot remember which direction does what.
Once again, notice that this can be corrected without replacing the
individual faucets: just replace the handles with blades. It is psychological perceptions that matter—the conceptual model—not
physical consistency.


**152** _The Design of Everyday Things_


The operation of faucets needs to be standardized so that the
psychological conceptual model of operation is the same for all
types of faucets. With the traditional dual faucet controls for hot
and cold water, the standards should state:


 - When the handles are round, both should rotate in the same direction

to change water volume.

 - When the handles are single blades, both should be pulled to change
water volume (which means rotating in opposite directions in the
faucet itself).


Other configurations of handles are possible. Suppose the handles are mounted on a horizontal axis so that they rotate vertically.
Then what? Would the answer differ for single blade handles and
round ones? I leave this as an exercise for the reader.

What about the evaluation problem? Feedback in the use of most
faucets is rapid and direct, so turning them the wrong way is easy
to discover and correct. The evaluate-action cycle is easy to traverse.
As a result, the discrepancy from normal rules is often not noticed—
unless you are in the shower and the feedback occurs when you
scald or freeze yourself. When the faucets are far removed from the
spout, as is the case where the faucets are located in the center of
the bathtub but the spouts high on an end wall, the delay between
turning the faucets and the change in temperature can be quite long:
I once timed a shower control to take 5 seconds. This makes setting
the temperature rather difficult. Turn the faucet the wrong way and
then dance around inside the shower while the water is scalding
hot or freezing cold, madly turning the faucet in what you hope is
the correct direction, hoping the temperature will stabilize quickly.
Here the problem comes from the properties of fluid flow—it takes
time for water to travel the 2 meters or so of pipe that might connect the faucets with the spout—so it is not easily remedied. But
the problem is exacerbated by poor design of the controls.
Now let’s turn to the modern single-spout, single-control faucet. Technology to the rescue. Move the control one way, it adjusts temperature. Move it another, it adjusts volume. Hurrah!

We control exactly the variables of interest, and the mixing spout
solves the evaluation problem.
Yes, these new faucets are beautiful. Sleek, elegant, prize winning. Unusable. They solved one set of problems only to create yet
another. The mapping problems now predominate. The difficulty
lies in a lack of standardization of the dimensions of control, and

then, which direction of movement means what? Sometimes there
is a knob that can be pushed or pulled, rotated clockwise or counterclockwise. But does the push or pull control volume or temperature? Is a pull more volume or less, hotter temperature or cooler?
Sometimes there is a lever that moves side to side or forward and

backward. Once again, which movement is volume, which temperature? And even then, which way is more (or hotter), which is
less (or cooler)? The perceptually simple one-control faucet still has
four mapping problems:


   - What dimension of control affects the temperature?

   - Which direction along that dimension means hotter?

   - What dimension of control affects the rate of flow?

   - Which direction along that dimension means more?


In the name of elegance, the moving parts sometimes meld invisibly into the faucet structure, making it nearly impossible even
to find the controls, let alone figure out which way they move or
what they control. And then, different faucet designs use different
solutions. One-control faucets ought to be superior because they
control the psychological variables of interest. But because of the
lack of standardization and awkward design (to call it “awkward”
is being kind), they frustrate many people so much that they tend
to be disliked more than they are admired.
Bath and kitchen faucet design ought to be simple, but can violate many design principles, including:


    - Visible affordances and signifiers

   - Discoverability

   - Immediacy of feedback


**154** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Finally, many violate the principle of desperation:


 - If all else fails, standardize.


Standardization is indeed the fundamental principle of desperation: when no other solution appears possible, simply design everything the same way, so people only have to learn once. If all
makers of faucets could agree on a standard set of motions to control amount and temperature (how about up and down to control
amount—up meaning increase—and left and right to control temperature, left meaning hot?), then we could all learn the standards
once, and forever afterward use the knowledge for every new faucet we encountered.

If you can’t put the knowledge on the device (that is, knowledge
in the world), then develop a cultural constraint: standardize what
has to be kept in the head. And remember the lesson from faucet
rotation on page 153: The standards should reflect the psychological conceptual models, not the physical mechanics.
Standards simplify life for everyone. At the same time, they
tend to hinder future development. And, as discussed in Chapter
6, there are often difficult political struggles in finding common
agreement. Nonetheless, when all else fails, standards are the way
to proceed.
