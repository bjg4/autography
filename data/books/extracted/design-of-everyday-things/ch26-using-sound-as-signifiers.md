**Using Sound as Signifiers**


Sometimes everything that is needed cannot be made visible. Enter
sound: sound can provide information available in no other way.
Sound can tell us that things are working properly or that they
need maintenance or repair. It can even save us from accidents.
Consider the information provided by:


 - The click when the bolt on a door slides home

 - The tinny sound when a door doesn’t shut right

 - The roaring sound when a car muffler gets a hole

 - The rattle when things aren’t secured

 - The whistle of a teakettle when the water boils

   - The click when the toast pops up

   - The increase in pitch when a vacuum cleaner gets clogged

   - The indescribable change in sound when a complex piece of machinery starts to have problems


Many devices simply beep and burp. These are not naturalistic sounds; they do not convey hidden information. When
used properly, a beep can assure you that you’ve pressed a
button, but the sound is as annoying as informative. Sounds
should be generated so as to give knowledge about the source.
They should convey something about the actions that are taking place, actions that matter to the user but that would otherwise not be visible. The buzzes, clicks, and hums that you hear
while a telephone call is being completed are one good example:
take out those noises and you are less certain that the connection is being made.
Real, natural sound is as essential as visual information because
sound tells us about things we can’t see, and it does so while our
eyes are occupied elsewhere. Natural sounds reflect the complex
interaction of natural objects: the way one part moves against another; the material of which the parts are made—hollow or solid,
metal or wood, soft or hard, rough or smooth. Sounds are generated when materials interact, and the sound tells us whether they
are hitting, sliding, breaking, tearing, crumbling, or bouncing. Experienced mechanics can diagnosis the condition of machinery just
by listening. When sounds are generated artificially, if intelligently
created using a rich auditory spectrum, with care to provide the
subtle cues that are informative without being annoying, they can
be as useful as sounds in the real world.

Sound is tricky. It can annoy and distract as easily as it can aid.
Sounds that at one’s first encounter are pleasant or cute easily become annoying rather than useful. One of the virtues of sounds
is that they can be detected even when attention is applied elsewhere. But this virtue is also a deficit, for sounds are often intrusive. Sounds are difficult to keep private unless the intensity is low
or earphones are used. This means both that neighbors may be


**156** _The Design of Everyday Things_


annoyed and that others can monitor your activities. The use of
sound to convey knowledge is a powerful and important idea, but
still in its infancy.
Just as the presence of sound can serve a useful role in providing
feedback about events, the absence of sound can lead to the same
kinds of difficulties we have already encountered from a lack of
feedback. The absence of sound can mean an absence of knowl
edge, and if feedback from an action is expected to come from
sound, silence can lead to problems.


**WHEN SILENCE KILLS**


It was a pleasant June day in Munich, Germany. I was picked up at
my hotel and driven to the country with farmland on either side of
the narrow, two-lane road. Occasional walkers strode by, and every
so often a bicyclist passed. We parked the car on the shoulder of
the road and joined a group of people looking up and down the
road. “Okay, get ready,” I was told. “Close your eyes and listen.”
I did so and about a minute later I heard a high-pitched whine,
accompanied by a low humming sound: an automobile was approaching. As it came closer, I could hear tire noise. After the car
had passed, I was asked my judgment of the sound. We repeated
the exercise numerous times, and each time the sound was different. What was going on? We were evaluating sound designs for
BMW’s new electric vehicles.

Electric cars are extremely quiet. The only sounds they make
come from the tires, the air, and occasionally, from the high-pitched
whine of the electronics. Car lovers really like the silence. Pedestrians have mixed feelings, but the blind are greatly concerned. After
all, the blind cross streets in traffic by relying upon the sounds of
vehicles. That’s how they know when it is safe to cross. And what
is true for the blind might also be true for anyone stepping onto
the street while distracted. If the vehicles don’t make any sounds,
they can kill. The United States National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration determined that pedestrians are considerably
more likely to be hit by hybrid or electric vehicles than by those
that have an internal combustion engine. The greatest danger is

when the hybrid or electric vehicles are moving slowly, when they
are almost completely silent. The sounds of an automobile are important signifiers of its presence.
Adding sound to a vehicle to warn pedestrians is not a new idea.
For many years, commercial trucks and construction equipment
have had to make beeping sounds when backing up. Horns are
required by law, presumably so that drivers can use them to alert
pedestrians and other drivers when the need arises, although they
are often used as a way of venting anger and rage instead. But
adding a continuous sound to a normal vehicle because it would
otherwise be too quiet, is a challenge.
What sound would you want? One group of blind people suggested putting some rocks into the hubcaps. I thought this was
brilliant. The rocks would provide a natural set of cues, rich in
meaning yet easy to interpret. The car would be quiet until the
wheels started to turn. Then, the rocks would make natural, continuous scraping sounds at low speeds, change to the pitter-patter of
falling stones at higher speeds, the frequency of the drops increasing with the speed of the car until the car was moving fast enough
that the rocks would be frozen against the circumference of the rim,
silent. Which is fine: the sounds are not needed for fast-moving
vehicles because then the tire noise is audible. The lack of sound

when the vehicle was not moving would be a problem, however.
The marketing divisions of automobile manufacturers thought
that the addition of artificial sounds would be a wonderful brand
ing opportunity, so each car brand or model should have its own
unique sound that captured just the car personality the brand
wished to convey. Porsche added loudspeakers to its electric car prototype to give it the same “throaty growl” as its gasoline-powered
cars. Nissan wondered whether a hybrid automobile should sound
like tweeting birds. Some manufacturers thought all cars should
sound the same, with standardized sounds and sound levels,
making it easier for everyone to learn how to interpret them. Some
blind people thought they should sound like cars—you know, gasoline engines, following the old tradition that new technologies
must always copy the old.


**158** _The Design of Everyday Things_


_Skeuomorphic_ is the technical term for incorporating old, familiar ideas into new technologies, even though they no longer
play a functional role. Skeuomorphic designs are often comfortable for traditionalists, and indeed the history of technology
shows that new technologies and materials often slavishly imitate the old for no apparent reason except that is what people
know how to do. Early automobiles looked like horse-driven
carriages without the horses (which is also why they were called
horseless carriages); early plastics were designed to look like
wood; folders in computer file systems often look the same as
paper folders, complete with tabs. One way of overcoming the
fear of the new is to make it look like the old. This practice is
decried by design purists, but in fact, it has its benefits in easing the transition from the old to the new. It gives comfort and
makes learning easier. Existing conceptual models need only be
modified rather than replaced. Eventually, new forms emerge
that have no relationship to the old, but the skeuomorphic designs probably helped the transition.
When it came to deciding what sounds the new silent automobiles should generate, those who wanted differentiation ruled the
day, yet everyone also agreed that there had to be some standards.
It should be possible to determine that the sound is coming from
an automobile, to identify its location, direction, and speed. No
sound would be necessary once the car was going fast enough, in
part because tire noise would be sufficient. Some standardization
would be required, although with a lot of leeway. International
standards committees started their procedures. Various countries,
unhappy with the normally glacial speed of standards agreements
and under pressure from their communities, started drafting legislation. Companies scurried to develop appropriate sounds, hiring
experts in psychoacoustics, psychologists, and Hollywood sound
designers.
The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a set of principles along with a detailed list of requirements, including sound levels, spectra, and other criteria. The full
document is 248 pages. The document states:


four: _Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback_ **159**


_This standard will ensure that blind, visually-impaired, and other pe-_
_destrians are able to detect and recognize nearby hybrid and electric_
_vehicles by requiring that hybrid and electric vehicles emit sound that_
_pedestrians will be able to hear in a range of ambient environments and_
_contain acoustic signal content that pedestrians will recognize as be-_
_ing emitted from a vehicle. The proposed standard establishes minimum_
_sound requirements for hybrid and electric vehicles when operating un-_
_der 30 kilometers per hour (km/h) (18 mph), when the vehicle’s starting_
_system is activated but the vehicle is stationary, and when the vehicle_
_is operating in reverse. The agency chose a crossover speed of 30 km/h_
_because this was the speed at which the sound levels of the hybrid and_
_electric vehicles measured by the agency approximated the sound levels_
_produced by similar internal combustion engine vehicles._ (Department


of Transportation, 2013.)


As I write this, sound designers are still experimenting. The automobile companies, lawmakers, and standards committees are
still at work. Standards are not expected until 2014 or later, and
then it will take considerable time to be deployed to the millions of
vehicles across the world.

What principles should be used for the design sounds of electric vehicles (including hybrids)? The sounds have to meet several criteria:


   - **Alerting.** The sound will indicate the presence of an electric vehicle.

   - **Orientation.** The sound will make it possible to determine where the
vehicle is located, a rough idea of its speed, and whether it is moving
toward or away from the listener.

   - **Lack of annoyance.** Because these sounds will be heard frequently
even in light traffic and continually in heavy traffic, they must not be
annoying. Note the contrast with sirens, horns, and backup signals,
all of which are intended to be aggressive warnings. Such sounds
are deliberately unpleasant, but because they are infrequent and for
relatively short duration, they are acceptable. The challenge faced by
electric vehicle sounds is to alert and orient, not annoy.


**160** _The Design of Everyday Things_


 - **Standardization versus individualization.** Standardization is nec
essary to ensure that all electric vehicle sounds can readily be interpreted. If they vary too much, novel sounds might confuse the
listener. Individualization has two functions: safety and marketing.
From a safety point of view, if there were many vehicles present on

the street, individualization would allow vehicles to be tracked. This

is especially important at crowded intersections. From a marketing
point of view, individualization can ensure that each brand of electric
vehicle has its own unique characteristic, perhaps matching the quality of the sound to the brand image.


Stand still on a street corner and listen carefully to the vehicles
around you. Listen to the silent bicycles and to the artificial sounds
of electric cars. Do the cars meet the criteria? After years of trying
to make cars run more quietly, who would have thought that one
day we would spend years of effort and tens of millions of dollars
to add sound?

###### HUMAN ERROR? NO, BAD DESIGN


Most industrial accidents are caused by human error:
estimates range between 75 and 95 percent. How is it
that so many people are so incompetent? Answer: They
aren’t. It’s a design problem.
If the number of accidents blamed upon human error were 1 to
5 percent, I might believe that people were at fault. But when the
percentage is so high, then clearly other factors must be involved.
When something happens this frequently, there must be another
underlying factor.
When a bridge collapses, we analyze the incident to find the
causes of the collapse and reformulate the design rules to ensure
that form of accident will never happen again. When we discover
that electronic equipment is malfunctioning because it is responding
to unavoidable electrical noise, we redesign the circuits to be more
tolerant of the noise. But when an accident is thought to be caused
by people, we blame them and then continue to do things just as
we have always done.
Physical limitations are well understood by designers; mental
limitations are greatly misunderstood. We should treat all failures
in the same way: find the fundamental causes and redesign the
system so that these can no longer lead to problems. We design



**162**


equipment that requires people to be fully alert and attentive for
hours, or to remember archaic, confusing procedures even if they
are only used infrequently, sometimes only once in a lifetime. We
put people in boring environments with nothing to do for hours on
end, until suddenly they must respond quickly and accurately. Or
we subject them to complex, high-workload environments, where
they are continually interrupted while having to do multiple tasks
simultaneously. Then we wonder why there is failure.
Even worse is that when I talk to the designers and administrators of these systems, they admit that they too have nodded off
while supposedly working. Some even admit to falling asleep for
an instant while driving. They admit to turning the wrong stove
burners on or off in their homes, and to other small but significant errors. Yet when their workers do this, they blame them for
“human error.” And when employees or customers have similar
issues, they are blamed for not following the directions properly,
or for not being fully alert and attentive.
