**The Human-Centered Design Process**


The double-diamond describes the two phases of design: finding
the right problem and fulfilling human needs. But how are these
actually done? This is where the human-centered design process comes into play: it takes place within the double-diamond
diverge-converge process.
There are four different activities in the human-centered design
process (Figure 6.2):

These four activities are iterated;
that is, they are repeated over and
over, with each cycle yielding more
insights and getting closer to the desired solution. Now let us examine

each activity separately.

search. Note that this is research

about the customer and the people
who will use the products under consideration. It is not the kind
of research that scientists do in their laboratories, trying to find
new laws of nature. The design researcher will go to the potential
customers, observing their activities, attempting to understand
their interests, motives, and true needs. The problem definition
for the product design will come from this deep understanding of
the goals the people are trying to accomplish and the impediments
they experience. One of its most critical techniques is to observe the
would-be customers in their natural environment, in their normal
lives, wherever the product or service being designed will actually
be used. Watch them in their homes, schools, and offices. Watch
them commute, at parties, at mealtime, and with friends at the local
bar. Follow them into the shower if necessary, because it is essential
to understand the real situations that they encounter, not some pure
isolated experience. This technique is called _applied ethnography,_ a
method adapted from the field of anthropology. Applied ethnography differs from the slower, more methodical, research-oriented
practice of academic anthropologists because the goals are different.



**222** _The Design of Everyday Things_


For one, design researchers have the goal of determining human
needs that can be addressed through new products. For another,
product cycles are driven by schedule and budget, both of which
require more rapid assessment than is typical in academic studies
that might go on for years.
It’s important that the people being observed match those of the
intended audience. Note that traditional measures of people, such
as age, education, and income, are not always important: what
matters most are the activities to be performed. Even when we
look at widely different cultures, the activities are often surprisingly similar. As a result, the studies can focus upon the activities and how they get done, while being sensitive to how the local
environment and culture might modify those activities. In some
cases, such as the products widely used in business, the activity
dominates. Thus, automobiles, computers, and phones are pretty
standardized across the world because their designs reflect the activities being supported.
In some cases, detailed analyses of the intended group are necessary. Japanese teenage girls are quite different from Japanese
women, and in turn, very different from German teenage girls. If
a product is intended for subcultures like these, the exact population must be studied. Another way of putting it is that different
products serve different needs. Some products are also symbols of
status or group membership. Here, although they perform useful
functions, they are also fashion statements. This is where teenagers
in one culture differ from those of another, and even from younger
children and older adults of the same culture. Design researchers
must carefully adjust the focus of their observations to the intended
market and people for whom the product is intended.
Will the product be used in some country other than where it is
being designed? There is only one way to find out: go there (and
always include natives in the team). Don’t take a shortcut and
stay home, talking to students or visitors from that country while
remaining in your own: what you will learn is seldom an accurate reflection of the target population or of the ways in which the
proposed product will actually be used. There is no substitute for


six: _Design Thinking_ **223**


direct observation of and interaction with the people who will be
using the product.
Design research supports both diamonds of the design process.
The first diamond, finding the right problem, requires a deep understanding of the true needs of people. Once the problem has
been defined, finding an appropriate solution again requires deep
understanding of the intended population, how those people perform their activities, their capabilities and prior experience, and
what cultural issues might be impacted.


**DESIGN RESE A RC H V ERSUS M A R KE T RESE A RC H**


Design and marketing are two important parts of the product
development group. The two fields are complementary, but
each has a different focus. Design wants to know what people really need and how they actually will use the product or service
under consideration. Marketing wants to know what people will
buy, which includes learning how they make their purchasing decisions. These different aims lead the two groups to develop different methods of inquiry. Designers tend to use qualitative observational methods by which they can study people in depth,
understanding how they do their activities and the environmental
factors that come into play. These methods are very time consuming, so designers typically only examine small numbers of people,
often numbering in the tens.
Marketing is concerned with customers. Who might possibly
purchase the item? What factors might entice them to consider
and purchase a product? Marketing traditionally uses large-scale,
quantitative studies, with heavy reliance on focus groups, surveys,
and questionnaires. In marketing, it is not uncommon to converse
with hundreds of people in focus groups, and to question tens of
thousands of people by means of questionnaires and surveys.
The advent of the Internet and the ability to assess huge
amounts of data have given rise to new methods of formal, quantitative market analysis. “Big data,” it is called, or sometimes
“market analytics.” For popular websites, A/B testing is possible
in which two potential variants of an offering are tested by giving


**224** _The Design of Everyday Things_


some randomly selected fraction of visitors (perhaps 10 percent)
one set of web pages (the A set); and another randomly selected
set of visitors, the other alternative (the B set). In a few hours, hundreds of thousands of visitors may have been exposed to each test
set, making it easy to see which yields better results. Moreover,
the website can capture a wealth of information about people and
their behavior: age, income, home and work addresses, previous
purchases, and other websites visited. The virtues of the use of big
data for market research are frequently touted. The deficiencies
are seldom noted, except for concerns about invasions of personal
privacy. In addition to privacy issues, the real problem is that numerical correlations say nothing of people’s real needs, of their
desires, and of the reasons for their activities. As a result, these
numerical data can give a false impression of people. But the use of
big data and market analytics is seductive: no travel, little expense,
and huge numbers, sexy charts, and impressive statistics, all very
persuasive to the executive team trying to decide which new products to develop. After all, what would you trust—neatly presented,
colorful charts, statistics, and significance levels based on millions
of observations, or the subjective impressions of a motley crew of
design researchers who worked, slept, and ate in remote villages,
with minimal sanitary facilities and poor infrastructure?
The different methods have different goals and produce very
different results. Designers complain that the methods used by
marketing don’t get at real behavior: what people say they do and
want does not correspond with their actual behavior or desires.
People in marketing complain that although design research methods yield deep insights, the small number of people observed is a
concern. Designers counter with the observation that traditional
marketing methods provide shallow insight into a large number
of people.
The debate is not useful. All groups are necessary. Customer
research is a tradeoff: deep insights on real needs from a tiny set
of people, versus broad, reliable purchasing data from a wide
range and large number of people. We need both. Designers understand what people really need. Marketing understands what


six: _Design Thinking_ **225**


people actually buy. These are not the same things, which is why
both approaches are required: marketing and design researchers
should work together in complementary teams.
What are the requirements for a successful product? First, if nobody buys the product, then all else is irrelevant. The product design has to provide support for all the factors people use in making
purchase decisions. Second, once the product has been purchased
and is put into use, it must support real needs so that people can
use, understand, and take pleasure from it. The design specifications
must include both factors: marketing and design, buying and using.


**IDEA GENERATION**


Once the design requirements are determined, the next step for
a design team is to generate potential solutions. This process is
called _idea generation,_ or _ideation._ This exercise might be done for
both of the double diamonds: during the phase of finding the correct problem, then during the problem solution phase.
This is the fun part of design: it is where creativity is critical.
There are many ways of generating ideas: many of these methods
fall under the heading of “brainstorming.” Whatever the method
used, two major rules are usually followed:


   - **Generate numerous ideas.** It is dangerous to become fixated upon
one or two ideas too early in the process.

   - **Be creative without regard for constraints.** Avoid criticizing ideas,
whether your own or those of others. Even crazy ideas, often obviously wrong, can contain creative insights that can later be extracted
and put to good use in the final idea selection. Avoid premature dis
missal of ideas.


I like to add a third rule:


    - **Question everything.** I am particularly fond of “stupid” questions.
A stupid question asks about things so fundamental that everyone
assumes the answer is obvious. But when the question is taken seriously, it often turns out to be profound: the obvious often is not ob

**226** _The Design of Everyday Things_


vious at all. What we assume to be obvious is simply the way things
have always been done, but now that it is questioned, we don’t actually know the reasons. Quite often the solution to problems is discovered through stupid questions, through questioning the obvious.


**PROTOTYPING**


The only way to really know whether an idea is reasonable is to
test it. Build a quick prototype or mock-up of each potential solution. In the early stages of this process, the mock-ups can be pencil sketches, foam and cardboard models, or simple images made
with simple drawing tools. I have made mock-ups with spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides, and with sketches on index cards or
sticky notes. Sometimes ideas are best conveyed by skits, especially if you’re developing services or automated systems that are
difficult to prototype.
One popular prototype technique is called “Wizard of Oz,” after
the wizard in L. Frank Baum’s classic book (and the classic movie)
_The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ . The wizard was actually just an ordinary person but, through the use of smoke and mirrors, he managed to appear mysterious and omnipotent. In other words, it was
all a fake: the wizard had no special powers.
The Wizard of Oz method can be used to mimic a huge, powerful
system long before it can be built. It can be remarkably effective in
the early stages of product development. I once used this method
to test a system for making airline reservations that had been designed by a research group at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto
Research Center (today it is simply the Palo Alto Research Center,
or PARC). We brought people into my laboratory in San Diego one at
a time, seated them in a small, isolated room, and had them type
their travel requirements into a computer. They thought they were
interacting with an automated travel assistance program, but in
fact, one of my graduate students was sitting in an adjacent room,
reading the typed queries and typing back responses (looking up
real travel schedules where appropriate). This simulation taught
us a lot about the requirements for such a system. We learned, for
example, that people’s sentences were very different from the ones


six: _Design Thinking_ **227**


we had designed the system to handle. Example: One of the people
we tested requested a round-trip ticket between San Diego and
San Francisco. After the system had determined the desired flight
to San Francisco, it asked, “When would you like to return?” The
person responded, “I would like to leave on the following Tuesday, but I have to be back before my first class at 9 am.” We soon
learned that it wasn’t sufficient to understand the sentences: we

also had to do problem-solving, using considerable knowledge
about such things as airport and meeting locations, traffic patterns,
delays for getting baggage and rental cars, and of course, parking—
more than our system was capable of doing. Our initial goal was to
understand language. The studies demonstrated that the goal was
too limited: we needed to understand human activities.

Prototyping during the problem specification phase is done mainly
to ensure that the problem is well understood. If the target population is already using something related to the new product, that
can be considered a prototype. During the problem solution phase
of design, then real prototypes of the proposed solution are invoked.


**TESTING**


Gather a small group of people who correspond as closely as possible to the target population—those for whom the product is intended. Have them use the prototypes as nearly as possible to the
way they would actually use them. If the device is normally used
by one person, test one person at a time. If it is normally used by a
group, test a group. The only exception is that even if the normal
usage is by a single person, it is useful to ask a pair of people to use
it together, one person operating the prototype, the other guiding
the actions and interpreting the results (aloud). Using pairs in this
way causes them to discuss their ideas, hypotheses, and frustrations openly and naturally. The research team should be observing,
either by sitting behind those being tested (so as not to distract
them) or by watching through video in another room (but having
the video camera visible and after describing the procedure). Video
recordings of the tests are often quite valuable, both for later showings to team members who could not be present and for review.


**228** _The Design of Everyday Things_


When the study is over, get more detailed information about
the people’s thought processes by retracing their steps, reminding
them of their actions, and questioning them. Sometimes it helps to
show them video recordings of their activities as reminders.
How many people should be studied? Opinions vary, but my associate, Jakob Nielsen, has long championed the number five: five
people studied individually. Then, study the results, refine them,
and do another iteration, testing five different people. Five is usually enough to give major findings. And if you really want to test
many more people, it is far more effective to do one test of five,
use the results to improve the system, and then keep iterating the
test-design cycle until you have tested the desired number of
people. This gives multiple iterations of improvement, rather
than just one.
Like prototyping, testing is done in the problem specification
phase to ensure that the problem is well understood, then done
again in the problem solution phase to ensure that the new design
meets the needs and abilities of those who will use it.


**ITERATION**


The role of iteration in human-centered design is to enable continual refinement and enhancement. The goal is rapid prototyping
and testing, or in the words of David Kelly, Stanford professor and
cofounder of the design firm IDEO, “Fail frequently, fail fast.”
Many rational executives (and government officials) never quite
understand this aspect of the design process. Why would you want
to fail? They seem to think that all that is necessary is to determine
the requirements, then build to those requirements. Tests, they believe, are only necessary to ensure that the requirements are met. It
is this philosophy that leads to so many unusable systems. Deliberate tests and modifications make things better. Failures are to be
encouraged—actually, they shouldn’t be called failures: they should
be thought of as learning experiences. If everything works perfectly,
little is learned. Learning occurs when there are difficulties.
The hardest part of design is getting the requirements right,
which means ensuring that the right problem is being solved, as


six: _Design Thinking_ **229**


well as that the solution is appropriate. Requirements made in the
abstract are invariably wrong. Requirements produced by asking
people what they need are invariably wrong. Requirements are developed by watching people in their natural environment.
When people are asked what they need, they primarily think of
the everyday problems they face, seldom noticing larger failures,
larger needs. They don’t question the major methods they use.
Moreover, even if they carefully explain how they do their tasks
and then agree that you got it right when you present it back to
them, when you watch them, they will often deviate from their
own description. “Why?” you ask. “Oh, I had to do this one differently,” they might reply; “this was a special case.” It turns out
that most cases are “special.” Any system that does not allow for
special cases will fail.
Getting the requirements right involves repeated study and testing: iteration. Observe and study: decide what the problem might
be, and use the results of tests to determine which parts of the design work, which don’t. Then iterate through all four processes
once again. Collect more design research if necessary, create more
ideas, develop the prototypes, and test them.
With each cycle, the tests and observations can be more targeted
and more efficient. With each cycle of the iteration, the ideas become clearer, the specifications better defined, and the prototypes
closer approximations to the target, the actual product. After the
first few iterations, it is time to start converging upon a solution.
The several different prototype ideas can be collapsed into one.
When does the process end? That is up to the product manager,
who needs to deliver the highest-possible quality while meeting
the schedule. In product development, schedule and cost provide
very strong constraints, so it is up to the design team to meet these
requirements while getting to an acceptable, high-quality design.
No matter how much time the design team has been allocated, the
final results only seem to appear in the last twenty-four hours before the deadline. (It’s like writing: no matter how much time you
are given, it’s finished only hours before the deadline.)


**230** _The Design of Everyday Things_


**ACTIVITY-CENTERED VERSUS HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN**


The intense focus on individuals is one of the hallmarks of human
centered design, ensuring that products do fit real needs, that they
are usable and understandable. But what if the product is intended
for people all across the world? Many manufacturers make essentially the same product for everyone. Although automobiles are
slightly modified for the requirements of a country, they are all
basically the same the world round. The same is true for cameras,
computers, telephones, tablets, television sets, and refrigerators.
Yes, there are some regional differences, but remarkably little. Even
products specifically designed for one culture—rice cookers, for
example—get adopted by other cultures elsewhere.
How can we pretend to accommodate all of these very different,
very disparate people? The answer is to focus on activities, not the
individual person. I call this _activity-centered design._ Let the activity
define the product and its structure. Let the conceptual model of
the product be built around the conceptual model of the activity.
Why does this work? Because people’s activities across the
world tend to be similar. Moreover, although people are unwilling
to learn systems that appear to have arbitrary, incomprehensible
requirements, they are quite willing to learn things that appear
to be essential to the activity. Does this violate the principles of
human-centered design? Not at all: consider it an enhancement of
HCD. After all, the activities are done by and for people. Activitycentered approaches are human-centered approaches, far better
suited for large, nonhomogeneous populations.
Take another look at the automobile, basically identical all across
the world. It requires numerous actions, many of which make little sense outside of the activity and that add to the complexity of
driving and to the rather long period it takes to become an accomplished, skilled driver. There is the need to master foot pedals, to
steer, use turn signals, control the lights, and watch the road, all
while being aware of events on either side of and behind the vehicle, and perhaps while maintaining conversations with the other
people in the auto. In addition, instruments on the panel need to


six: _Design Thinking_ **231**


be watched, especially the speed indicator, as well as the water
temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The locations of the rearand side-view mirrors require the eyes to be off the road ahead for
considerable time.

People learn to drive cars quite successfully despite the need
to master so many subcomponent tasks. Given the design of the
car and the activity of driving, each task seems appropriate. Yes,
we can make things better. Automatic transmissions eliminate the
need for the third pedal, the clutch. Heads-up displays mean that
critical instrument panel and navigation information can be displayed in the space in front of the driver, so no eye movements are
required to monitor them (although it requires an attentional shift,
which does take attention off the road). Someday we will replace
the three different mirrors with one video display that shows objects on all sides of the car in one image, simplifying yet another
action. How do we make things better? By careful study of the
activities that go on during driving.
Support the activities while being sensitive to human capabilities,
and people will accept the design and learn whatever is necessary.


**ON T HE DIF F ERENC ES BE T W EEN TASKS A ND AC T I V I T IES**


One comment: there is a difference between task and activity. I
emphasize the need to design for activities: designing for tasks is
usually too restrictive. An activity is a high-level structure, perhaps
“go shopping.” A task is a lower-level component of an activity,
such as “drive to the market,” “find a shopping basket,” “use a
shopping list to guide the purchases,” and so forth.
An activity is a collected set of tasks, but all performed together
toward a common high-level goal. A task is an organized, cohesive
set of operations directed toward a single, low-level goal. Products
have to provide support for both activities and the various tasks
that are involved. Well-designed devices will package together the
various tasks that are required to support an activity, making them
work seamlessly with one another, making sure the work done for
one does not interfere with the requirements for another.


**232** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Activities are hierarchical, so a high-level activity (going to work)
will have under it numerous lower-level ones. In turn, low-level
activities spawn “tasks,” and tasks are eventually executed by basic “operations.” The American psychologists Charles Carver and
Michael Scheier suggest that goals have three fundamental levels
that control activities. Be-goals are at the highest, most abstract
level and govern a person’s being: they determine why people act,
are fundamental and long lasting, and determine one’s self-image.
Of far more practical concern for everyday activity is the next level
down, the do-goal, which is more akin to the goal I discuss in the
seven stages of activity. Do-goals determine the plans and actions
to be performed for an activity. The lowest level of this hierarchy is the motor-goal, which specifies just how the actions are performed: this is more at the level of tasks and operations rather than
activities. The German psychologist Marc Hassenzahl has shown
how this three-level analysis can be used to guide in the development and analysis of a person’s experience (the user experience,
usually abbreviated UX) in interacting with products.
Focusing upon tasks is too limiting. Apple’s success with its
music player, the iPod, was because Apple supported the entire
activity involved in listening to music: discovering it, purchasing
it, getting it into the music player, developing playlists (that could
be shared), and listening to the music. Apple also allowed other
companies to add to the capabilities of the system with external
speakers, microphones, all sorts of accessories. Apple made it possible to send the music throughout the home, to be listened to on
those other companies’ sound systems. Apple’s success was due to
its combination of two factors: brilliant design plus support for the
entire activity of music enjoyment.
Design for individuals and the results may be wonderful for the
particular people they were designed for, but a mismatch for others. Design for activities and the result will be usable by everyone.
A major benefit is that if the design requirements are consistent
with their activities, people will tolerate complexity and the requirements to learn something new: as long as the complexity and


six: _Design Thinking_ **233**


the new things to be learned feel appropriate to the task, they will
feel natural and be viewed as reasonable.


**ITERATIVE DESIGN VERSUS LINEAR STAGES**


The traditional design process is linear, sometimes called the _water-_
_fall method_ because progress goes in a single direction, and once decisions have been made, it is difficult or impossible to go back. This
is in contrast to the iterative method of human-centered design,
where the process is circular, with continual refinement, continual change, and encouragement of backtracking, rethinking early
decisions. Many software developers experiment with variations
on the theme, variously called by such names as Scrum and Agile.
Linear, waterfall methods make logical sense. It makes sense that
design research should precede design, design precede engineering development, engineering precede manufacturing, and so on.
Iteration makes sense in helping to clarify the problem statement
and requirements; but when projects are large, involving considerable people, time, and budget, it would be horribly expensive to
allow iteration to last too long. On the other hand, proponents of
iterative development have seen far too many project teams rush
to develop requirements that later prove to be faulty, sometimes
wasting huge amounts of money as a result. Numerous large
projects have failed at a cost of multiple billions of dollars.
The most traditional waterfall methods are called _gated_ methods because they have a linear set of phases or stages, with a gate
blocking transition from one stage to the next. The gate is a management review during which progress is evaluated and the decision to proceed to the next stage is made.
Which method is superior? As is invariably the case where fierce
debate is involved, both have virtues and both have deficits. In design, one of the most difficult activities is to get the specifications
right: in other words, to determine that the correct problem is being solved. Iterative methods are designed to defer the formation of
rigid specifications, to start off by diverging across a large set of possible requirements or problem statements before convergence, then
again diverging across a large number of potential solutions before


**234** _The Design of Everyday Things_


converging. Early prototypes have to be tested through real interaction with the target population in order to refine the requirements.
The iterative method, however, is best suited for the early design
phases of a product, not for the later stages. It also has difficulty
scaling its procedures to handle large projects. It is extremely difficult to deploy successfully on projects that involve hundreds or
even thousands of developers, take years to complete, and cost
in the millions or billions of dollars. These large projects include
complex consumer goods and large programming jobs, such as automobiles; operating systems for computers, tablets, and phones;
and word processors and spreadsheets.
Decision gates give management much better control over the
process than they have in the iterative methods. However, they are
cumbersome. The management reviews at each of the gates can
take considerable time, both in preparation for them and then in
the decision time after the presentations. Weeks can be wasted because of the difficulty of scheduling all the senior executives from
the different divisions of the company who wish to have a say.
Many groups are experimenting with different ways of managing the product development process. The best methods combine
the benefits of both iteration and stage reviews. Iteration occurs
inside the stages, between the gates. The goal is to have the best of
both worlds: iterative experimentation to refine the problem and
the solution, coupled with management reviews at the gates.
The trick is to delay precise specification of the product requirements until some iterative testing with rapidly deployed prototypes
has been done, while still keeping tight control over schedule, budget, and quality. It may appear impossible to prototype some large
projects (for example, large transportation systems), but even there a
lot can be done. The prototypes might be scaled objects, constructed
by model makers or 3-D printing methods. Even well-rendered
drawings and videos of cartoons or simple animation sketches can
be useful. Virtual reality computer aids allow people to envision
themselves using the final product, and in the case of a building, to
envision living or working within it. All of these methods can provide rapid feedback before much time or money has been expended.


six: _Design Thinking_ **235**


The hardest part of the development of complex products is
management: organizing and communicating and synchronizing
the many different people, groups, and departmental divisions
that are required to make it happen. Large projects are especially
difficult, not only because of the problem of managing so many
different people and groups, but also because the projects’ long
time horizon introduces new difficulties. In the many years it takes
to go from project formulation to completion, the requirements and
technologies will probably change, making some of the proposed
work irrelevant and obsolete; the people who will make use of the
results might very well change; and the people involved in executing the project definitely will change.
Some people will leave the project, perhaps because of illness or
injury, retirement or promotion. Some will change companies and
others will move on to other jobs in the same company. Whatever
the reason, considerable time is lost finding replacements and then
bringing them up to the full knowledge and skill level required.
Sometimes this is not even possible because critical knowledge
about project decisions and methods are in the form we call _implicit_
_knowledge_ ; that is, within the heads of the workers. When workers
leave, their implicit knowledge goes with them. The management
of large projects is a difficult challenge.


**What I Just Told You?**
**It Doesn’t Really Work That Way**


The preceding sections describe the human-centered design process for product development. But there is an old joke about the
difference between theory and practice:


_In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice._
_In practice, there is._


The HCD process describes the ideal. But the reality of life within
a business often forces people to behave quite differently from that
ideal. One disenchanted member of the design team for a consumer products company told me that although his company pro

**236** _The Design of Everyday Things_


fesses to believe in user experience and to follow human-centered
design, in practice there are only two drivers of new products:


1. Adding features to match the competition
2. Adding some feature driven by a new technology


“Do we look for human needs?” he asked, rhetorically. “No,” he
answered himself.

This is typical: market-driven pressures plus an engineeringdriven company yield ever-increasing features, complexity, and
confusion. But even companies that do intend to search for human
needs are thwarted by the severe challenges of the product development process, in particular, the challenges of insufficient time and
insufficient money. In fact, having watched many products succumb
to these challenges, I propose a “Law of Product Development”:


**DON NORMAN’S LAW OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT**


_The day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and_
_above budget._


Product launches are always accompanied by schedules and budgets. Usually the schedule is driven by outside considerations, including holidays, special product announcement opportunities,
and even factory schedules. One product I worked on was given
the unrealistic timeline of four weeks because the factory in Spain
would then go on vacation, and when the workers returned, it
would be too late to get the product out in time for the Christmas
buying season.
Moreover, product development takes time even to get started.
People are never sitting around with nothing to do, waiting to be
called for the product. No, they must be recruited, vetted, and then
transitioned off their current jobs. This all takes time, time that is
seldom scheduled.

So imagine a design team being told that it is about to work on
a new product. “Wonderful,” cries the team; “we’ll immediately
send out our design researchers to study target customers.” “How


six: _Design Thinking_ **237**


long will that take?” asks the product manager. “Oh, we can do it
quickly: a week or two to make the arrangements, and then two
weeks in the field. Perhaps a week to distill the findings. Four or
five weeks.” “Sorry,” says the product manager, “we don’t have
time. For that matter, we don’t have the budget to send a team into
the field for two weeks.” “But it’s essential if we really want to
understand the customer,” argues the design team. “You’re absolutely right,” says the product manager, “but we’re behind schedule: we can’t afford either the time or the money. Next time. Next
time we will do it right.” Except there is never a next time, because
when the next time comes around, the same arguments get repeated: that product also starts behind schedule and over budget.
Product development involves an incredible mix of disciplines,
from designers to engineers and programmers, manufacturing,
packaging, sales, marketing, and service. And more. The product
has to appeal to the current customer base as well as to expand
beyond to new customers. Patents create a minefield for designers
and engineers, for today it is almost impossible to design or build
anything that doesn’t conflict with patents, which means redesign
to work one’s way through the mines.
Each of the separate disciplines has a different view of the product, each has different but specific requirements to be met. Often
the requirements posed by each discipline are contradictory or
incompatible with those of the other disciplines. But all of them
are correct when viewed from their respective perspective. In most
companies, however, the disciplines work separately, design passing its results to engineering and programming, which modify
the requirements to fit their needs. They then pass their results to
manufacturing, which does further modification, then marketing
requests changes. It’s a mess.
What is the solution?

The way to handle the time crunch that eliminates the ability to
do good up-front design research is to separate that process from
the product team: have design researchers always out in the field,
always studying potential products and customers. Then, when
the product team is launched, the designers can say, “We already

examined this case, so here are our recommendations.” The same
argument applies to market researchers.
The clash of disciplines can be resolved by multidisciplinary
teams whose participants learn to understand and respect the
requirements of one another. Good product development teams
work as harmonious groups, with representatives from all the
relevant disciplines present at all times. If all the viewpoints and
requirements can be understood by all participants, it is often possible to think of creative solutions that satisfy most of the issues.
Note that working with these teams is also a challenge. Everyone
speaks a different technical language. Each discipline thinks it is
the most important part of the process. Quite often, each discipline
thinks the others are stupid, that they are making inane requests.
It takes a skilled product manager to create mutual understanding
and respect. But it can be done.
The design practices described by the double-diamond and the
human-centered design process are the ideal. Even though the ideal
can seldom be met in practice, it is always good to aim for the ideal,
but to be realistic about the time and budgetary challenges. These
can be overcome, but only if they are recognized and designed into
the process. Multidisciplinary teams allow for enhanced communication and collaboration, often saving both time and money.
