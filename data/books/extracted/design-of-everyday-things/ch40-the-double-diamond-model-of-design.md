**The Double-Diamond Model of Design**


Designers often start by questioning the problem given to them:
they expand the scope of the problem, diverging to examine all
the fundamental issues that underlie it. Then they converge upon
a single problem statement. During the solution phase of their
studies, they first expand the space of possible solutions, the divergence phase. Finally, they converge upon a proposed solution
(Figure 6.1). This double diverge-converge pattern was first introduced in 2005 by the British Design Council, which called it the _double-_
_diamond design process model._ The Design Council divided the
design process into four stages: “discover” and “define”—for
the divergence and convergence phases of finding the right problem,

**Diamond Model of Design.**
Start with an idea, and through
the initial design research, expand the thinking to explore the
fundamental issues. Only then is
it time to converge upon the real,
underlying problem. Similarly,
use design research tools to explore a wide variety of solutions
before converging upon one.

the British Design Council, 2005.)

and “develop” and “deliver”—for the divergence and convergence
phases of finding the right solution.
The double diverge-converge process is quite effective at freeing designers from unnecessary restrictions to the problem and
solution spaces. But you can sympathize with a product manager
who, having given the designers a problem to solve, finds them
questioning the assignment and insisting on traveling all over
the world to seek deeper understanding. Even when the designers start focusing upon the problem, they do not seem to make
progress, but instead develop a wide variety of ideas and thoughts,
many only half-formed, many clearly impractical. All this can be
rather unsettling to the product manager who, concerned about
meeting the schedule, wants to see immediate convergence. To add
to the frustration of the product manager, as the designers start to
converge upon a solution, they may realize that they have inappropriately formulated the problem, so the entire process must be
repeated (although it can go more quickly this time).
This repeated divergence and convergence is important in properly determining the right problem to be solved and then the best
way to solve it. It looks chaotic and ill-structured, but it actually
follows well-established principles and procedures. How does
the product manager keep the entire team on schedule despite the
apparent random and divergent methods of designers? Encourage
their free exploration, but hold them to the schedule (and budget)
constraints. There is nothing like a firm deadline to get creative
minds to reach convergence.
