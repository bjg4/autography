**The Paradox of Technology**


Technology offers the potential to make life easier and more enjoyable; each new technology provides increased benefits. At the
same time, added complexities increase our difficulty and frustration with technology. The design problem posed by technological
advances is enormous. Consider the wristwatch. A few decades

ago, watches were simple. All you had to do was set the time and
keep the watch wound. The standard control was the stem: a knob
at the side of the watch. Turning the knob would wind the spring
that provided power to the watch movement. Pulling out the knob
and turning it rotated the hands. The operations were easy to learn
and easy to do. There was a reasonable relationship between the

turning of the knob and the resulting turning of the hands. The
design even took into account human error. In its normal position,
turning the stem wound the mainspring of the clock. The stem had
to be pulled before it would engage the gears for setting the time.
Accidental turns of the stem did no harm.

Watches in olden times were expensive instruments, manufactured by hand. They were sold in jewelry stores. Over time,
with the introduction of digital technology, the cost of watches
decreased rapidly, while their accuracy and reliability increased.
Watches became tools, available in a wide variety of styles and
shapes and with an ever-increasing number of functions. Watches
were sold everywhere, from local shops to sporting goods stores
to electronic stores. Moreover, accurate clocks were incorporated in
many appliances, from phones to musical keyboards: many people
no longer felt the need to wear a watch. Watches became inexpensive enough that the average person could own multiple watches.
They became fashion accessories, where one changed the watch
with each change in activity and each change of clothes.
In the modern digital watch, instead of winding the spring, we
change the battery, or in the case of a solar-powered watch, ensure
that it gets its weekly dose of light. The technology has allowed
more functions: the watch can give the day of the week, the month,
and the year; it can act as a stopwatch (which itself has several
functions), a countdown timer, and an alarm clock (or two); it has
the ability to show the time for different time zones; it can act as
a counter and even as a calculator. My watch, shown in Figure
1.8, has many functions. It even has a radio receiver to allow it to
set its time with official time stations around the world. Even so,
it is far less complex than many that are available. Some watches
have built-in compasses and barometers, accelerometers, and temperature gauges. Some have GPS and Internet receivers so they
can display the weather and news, e-mail messages, and the latest from social networks. Some have built-in cameras. Some work

with buttons, knobs, motion, or speech. Some detect gestures. The
watch is no longer just an instrument for telling time: it has become
a platform for enhancing multiple activities and lifestyles.

The added functions cause problems: How can all these functions fit into a small, wearable size? There are no easy answers.
Many people have solved the problem by not using a watch. They
use their phone instead. A cell phone performs all the functions
much better than the tiny watch, while also displaying the time.
Now imagine a future where instead of the phone replacing
the watch, the two will merge, perhaps worn on the wrist, perhaps on the head like glasses, complete with display screen. The
phone, watch, and components of a computer will all form one
unit. We will have flexible displays that show only a tiny amount
of information in their normal state, but that can unroll to considerable size. Projectors will be so small and light that they can be
built into watches or phones (or perhaps rings and other jewelry),
projecting their images onto any convenient surface. Or perhaps
our devices won’t have displays, but will quietly whisper the results into our ears, or simply use whatever display happens to be
available: the display in the seatback of cars or airplanes, hotel
room televisions, whatever is nearby. The devices will be able to
do many useful things, but I fear they will also frustrate: so many
things to control, so little space for controls or signifiers. The obvious solution is to use exotic gestures or spoken commands, but
how will we learn, and then remember, them? As I discuss later,
the best solution is for there to be agreed upon standards, so we
need learn the controls only once. But as I also discuss, agreeing
upon these is a complex process, with many competing forces hindering rapid resolution. We will see.
The same technology that simplifies life by providing more
functions in each device also complicates life by making the device
harder to learn, harder to use. This is the paradox of technology
and the challenge for the designer.
