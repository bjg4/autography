**Knowledge in the Head**


Knowledge in the world, external knowledge, is a valuable tool
for remembering, but only if it is available at the right place, at the
right time, in the appropriate situation. Otherwise, we must use
knowledge in the head, in the mind. A folk saying captures this
situation well: “Out of sight, out of mind.” Effective memory uses
all the clues available: knowledge in the world and in the head,
combining world and mind. We have already seen how the combination allows us to function quite well in the world even though
either source of knowledge, by itself, is insufficient.


**HOW PILOTS REMEMBER WHAT**

**AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL TELLS THEM**


Airplane pilots have to listen to commands from air-traffic control
delivered at a rapid pace, and then respond accurately. Their lives
depend upon being able to follow the instructions accurately. One
website, discussing the problem, gave this example of instructions
to a pilot about to take off for a flight:

_Frasca 141, cleared to Mesquite airport, via turn left heading 090, radar_
_vectors to Mesquite airport. Climb and maintain 2,000. Expect 3,000_
_10 minutes after departure. Departure frequency 124.3, squawk 5270._
(Typical Air traffic control sequence, usually spoken extremely rapidly.
Text from “ATC Phraseology,” on numerous websites, with no credit for
originator.)


“How can we remember all that,” asked one novice pilot, “when
we are trying to focus on taking off?” Good question. Taking off
is a busy, dangerous procedure with a lot going on, both inside
and outside the airplane. How do pilots remember? Do they have
superior memories?
Pilots use three major techniques:


1. They write down the critical information.
2. They enter it into their equipment as it is told to them, so minimal
memory is required.
3. They remember some of it as meaningful phrases.


Although to the outside observer, all the instructions and numbers seem random and confusing, to the pilots they are familiar
names, familiar numbers. As one respondent pointed out, those
are common numbers and a familiar pattern for a takeoff. “Frasca
141” is the name of the airplane, announcing the intended recipient
of these instructions. The first critical item to remember is to turn

left to a compass direction of 090, then climb to an altitude of 2,000
feet. Write those two numbers down. Enter the radio frequency
124.3 into the radio as you hear it—but most of the time this frequency is known in advance, so the radio is probably already set
to it. All you have to do is look at it and see that it is set properly.
Similarly, setting the “squawk box to 5270” is the special code the
airplane sends whenever it is hit by a radar signal, identifying the
airplane to the air-traffic controllers. Write it down, or set it into
the equipment as it is being said. As for the one remaining item,
“Expect 3,000 10 minutes after departure,” nothing need be done.
This is just reassurance that in ten minutes, Frasca 141 will proba

bly be advised to climb to 3,000 feet, but if so, there will be a new
command to do so.

How do pilots remember? They transform the new knowledge
they have just received into memory in the world, sometimes by
writing, sometimes by using the airplane’s equipment.
The design implication? The easier it is to enter the information
into the relevant equipment as it is heard, the less chance of memory error. The air-traffic control system is evolving to help. The
instructions from the air-traffic controllers will be sent digitally,
so that they can remain displayed on a screen as long as the pilot
wishes. The digital transmission also makes it easy for automated
equipment to set itself to the correct parameters. Digital transmission of the controller’s commands has some disadvantages, however.
Other aircraft will not hear the commands, which reduces pilot
awareness of what all the airplanes in the vicinity are going to do.
Researchers in air-traffic control and aviation safety are looking
into these issues. Yes, it’s a design issue.


**REMINDING: PROSPECTIVE MEMORY**


The phrases _prospective memory_ or _memory for the future_ might sound
counterintuitive, or perhaps like the title of a science-fiction novel,
but to memory researchers, the first phrase simply denotes the task
of remembering to do some activity at a future time. The second
phrase denotes planning abilities, the ability to imagine future scenarios. Both are closely related.
Consider reminding. Suppose you have promised to meet some
friends at a local café on Wednesday at three thirty in the afternoon. The knowledge is in your head, but how are you going to
remember it at the proper time? You need to be reminded. This is
a clear instance of prospective memory, but your ability to provide
the required cues involves some aspect of memory for the future as
well. Where will you be Wednesday just before the planned meeting? What can you think of now that will help you remember then?
There are many strategies for reminding. One is simply to keep
the knowledge in your head, trusting yourself to recall it at the


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **107**


critical time. If the event is important enough, you will have no
problem remembering it. It would be quite strange to have to set a
calendar alert to remind yourself, “Getting married at 3 PM.”
Relying upon memory in the head is not a good technique for
commonplace events. Ever forget a meeting with friends? It happens a lot. Not only that, but even if you might remember the
appointment, will you remember all the details, such as that you
intended to loan a book to one of them? Going shopping, you may
remember to stop at the store on the way home, but will you remember all the items you were supposed to buy?
If the event is not personally important and several days away, it
is wise to transfer some of the burden to the world: notes, calendar
reminders, special cell phone or computer reminding services. You
can ask friends to remind you. Those of us with assistants put the
burden on them. They, in turn, write notes, enter events on calendars, or set alarms on their computer systems.
Why burden other people when we can put the burden on
the thing itself? Do I want to remember to take a book to a colleague? I put the book someplace where I cannot fail to see it when
I leave the house. A good spot is against the front door so that I
can’t leave without tripping over it. Or I can put my car keys on it,
so when I leave, I am reminded. Even if I forget, I can’t drive away
without the keys. (Better yet, put the keys under the book, else I
might still forget the book.)
There are two different aspects to a reminder: the signal and the
message. Just as in doing an action we can distinguish between
knowing _what_ can be done and knowing _how_ to do it, in reminding
we must distinguish between the _signal_ —knowing that something
is to be remembered, and the _message_ —remembering the information itself. Most popular reminding methods typically provide
only one or the other of these two critical aspects. The famous “tie
a string around your finger” reminder provides only the signal. It
gives no hint of what is to be remembered. Writing a note to yourself
provides only the message; it doesn’t remind you ever to look at it.
The ideal reminder has to have both components: the signal that
something is to be remembered, and then the message of what it is.


**108** _The Design of Everyday Things_


The signal that something is to be remembered can be a sufficient memory cue if it occurs at the correct time and place. Being
reminded too early or too late is just as useless as having no reminder. But if the reminder comes at the correct time or location,
the environmental cue can suffice to provide enough knowledge to
aid retrieval of the to-be-remembered item. Time-based reminders

can be effective: the _bing_ of my cell phone reminds me of the next
appointment. Location-based reminders can be effective in giving
the cue at the precise place where it will be needed. All the knowledge needed can reside in the world, in our technology.
The need for timely reminders has created loads of products that
make it easier to put the knowledge in the world—timers, diaries,
calendars. The need for electronic reminders is well known, as the
proliferation of apps for smart phones, tablets, and other portable
devices attests. Yet surprisingly in this era of screen-based devices,
paper tools are still enormously popular and effective, as the number of paper-based diaries and reminders indicates.
The sheer number of different reminder methods also indicates

that there is indeed a great need for assistance in remembering, but
that none of the many schemes and devices is completely satisfactory. After all, if any one of them was, then we wouldn’t need so
many. The less effective ones would disappear and new schemes
would not continually be invented.


**The Tradeoff Between Knowledge**
**in the World and in the Head**


Knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head are both essential in our daily functioning. But to some extent we can choose
to lean more heavily on one or the other. That choice requires a
tradeoff—gaining the advantages of knowledge in the world
means losing the advantages of knowledge in the head (Table 3.1).
Knowledge in the world acts as its own reminder. It can help
us recover structures that we otherwise would forget. Knowledge
in the head is efficient: no search and interpretation of the environment is required. The tradeoff is that to use our knowledge in
the head, we have to be able to store and retrieve it, which might

require considerable amounts of learning. Knowledge in the world
requires no learning, but can be more difficult to use. And it relies
heavily upon the continued physical presence of the knowledge;
change the environment and the knowledge might be lost. Performance relies upon the physical stability of the task environment.
As we just discussed, reminders provide a good example of the
relative tradeoffs between knowledge in the world versus in
the head. Knowledge in the world is accessible. It is self-reminding.
It is always there, waiting to be seen, waiting to be used. That is
why we structure our offices and our places of work so carefully.
We put piles of papers where they can be seen, or if we like a clean
desk, we put them in standardized locations and teach ourselves
(knowledge in the head) to look in these standard places routinely.
We use clocks and calendars and notes. Knowledge in the mind

is ephemeral: here now, gone later. We can’t count on something
being present in mind at any particular time, unless it is triggered
by some external event or unless we deliberately keep it in mind
through constant repetition (which then prevents us from having
other conscious thoughts). Out of sight, out of mind.
As we move away from many physical aids, such as printed
books and magazines, paper notes, and calendars, much of what
we use today as knowledge in the world will become invisible. Yes,
it will all be available on display screens, but unless the screens
always show this material, we will have added to the burden of
memory in the head. We may not have to remember all the details
of the information stored away for us, but we will have to remember that it is there, that it needs to be redisplayed at the appropriate
time for use or for reminding.
