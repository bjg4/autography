**The Classification of Slips**


_A colleague reported that he went to his car to drive to work. As he_
_drove away, he realized that he had forgotten his briefcase, so he turned_
_around and went back. He stopped the car, turned off the engine, and_
_unbuckled his wristwatch. Yes, his wristwatch, instead of his seatbelt._


The story illustrates both a memory-lapse slip and an action slip.
The forgetting of the briefcase is a memory-lapse slip. The unbuckling of the wristwatch is an action slip, in this case a combination
of description-similarity and capture error (described later in this
chapter).
Most everyday errors are slips. Intending to do one action, you
find yourself doing another. When a person says something clearly
and distinctly to you, you “hear” something quite different. The
study of slips is the study of the psychology of everyday errors—
what Freud called “the psychopathology of everyday life.” Freud
believed that slips have hidden, dark meanings, but most are accounted for by rather simple mental mechanisms.
An interesting property of slips is that, paradoxically, they tend
to occur more frequently to skilled people than to novices. Why?
Because slips often result from a lack of attention to the task.
Skilled people—experts—tend to perform tasks automatically, under subconscious control. Novices have to pay considerable conscious attention, resulting in a relatively low occurrence of slips.

Some slips result from the similarities of actions. Or an event
in the world may automatically trigger an action. Sometimes our
thoughts and actions may remind us of unintended actions,
which we then perform. There are numerous different kinds of
action slips, categorized by the underlying mechanisms that give
rise to them. The three most relevant to design are:


   - capture slips

    - description-similarity slips

   - mode errors


**CAPTURE SLIPS**


_I was using a copying machine, and I was counting the pages. I found_
_myself counting, “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.” I had_
_been playing cards recently._


The capture slip is defined as the situation where, instead of the
desired activity, a more frequently or recently performed one gets
done instead: it captures the activity. Capture errors require that
part of the action sequences involved in the two activities be identical, with one sequence being far more familiar than the other.
After doing the identical part, the more frequent or more recent
activity continues, and the intended one does not get done. Seldom, if ever, does the unfamiliar sequence capture the familiar one.
All that is needed is a lapse of attention to the desired action at
the critical junction when the identical portions of the sequences
diverge into the two different activities. Capture errors are, therefore, partial memory-lapse errors. Interestingly, capture errors are
more prevalent in experienced skilled people than in beginners, in
part because the experienced person has automated the required
actions and may not be paying conscious attention when the intended action deviates from the more frequent one.
Designers need to avoid procedures that have identical opening steps but then diverge. The more experienced the workers, the
more likely they are to fall prey to capture. Whenever possible,
sequences should be designed to differ from the very start.

**DESCRIPTION-SIMILARITY SLIPS**


_A former student reported that one day he came home from jogging, took_
_off his sweaty shirt, and rolled it up in a ball, intending to throw it in_
_the laundry basket. Instead he threw it in the toilet. (It wasn’t poor aim:_
_the laundry basket and toilet were in different rooms.)_


In the slip known as a description-similarity slip, the error is to
act upon an item similar to the target. This happens when the description of the target is sufficiently vague. Much as we saw in
Chapter 3, Figure 3.1, where people had difficulty distinguishing
among different images of money because their internal descriptions did not have sufficient discriminating information, the same
thing can happen to us, especially when we are tired, stressed, or
overloaded. In the example that opened this section, both the laundry basket and the toilet bowl are containers, and if the description
of the target was sufficiently ambiguous, such as “a large enough
container,” the slip could be triggered.
Remember the discussion in Chapter 3 that most objects don’t
need precise descriptions, simply enough precision to distinguish
the desired target from alternatives. This means that a description
that usually suffices may fail when the situation changes so that
multiple similar items now match the description. Descriptionsimilarity errors result in performing the correct action on the
wrong object. Obviously, the more the wrong and right objects
have in common, the more likely the errors are to occur. Similarly, the more objects present at the same time, the more likely
the error.

Designers need to ensure that controls and displays for different purposes are significantly different from one another. A lineup
of identical-looking switches or displays is very apt to lead to
description-similarity error. In the design of airplane cockpits,
many controls are shape coded so that they both look and feel different from one another: the throttle levers are different from the

flap levers (which might look and feel like a wing flap), which are
different from the landing gear control (which might look and feel
like a wheel).

**MEMORY-LAPSE SLIPS**


Errors caused by memory failures are common. Consider these
examples:


   - Making copies of a document, walking off with the copy, but leaving
the original inside the machine.

    - Forgetting a child. This error has numerous examples, such as leaving
a child behind at a rest stop during a car trip, or in the dressing room
of a department store, or a new mother forgetting her one-month-old
and having to go to the police for help in finding the baby.

   - Losing a pen because it was taken out to write something, then put
down while doing some other task. The pen is forgotten in the activities of putting away a checkbook, picking up goods, talking to a
salesperson or friends, and so on. Or the reverse: borrowing a pen,
using it, and then putting it away in your pocket or purse, even
though it is someone else’s (this is also a capture error).

   - Using a bank or credit card to withdraw money from an automatic
teller machine, then walking off without the card, is such a frequent
error that many machines now have a forcing function: the card must
be removed before the money will be delivered. Of course, it is then
possible to walk off without the money, but this is less likely than
forgetting the card because money is the goal of using the machine.


Memory lapses are common causes of error. They can lead to
several kinds of errors: failing to do all of the steps of a procedure;
repeating steps; forgetting the outcome of an action; or forgetting
the goal or plan, thereby causing the action to be stopped.
The immediate cause of most memory-lapse failures is interruptions, events that intervene between the time an action is decided
upon and the time it is completed. Quite often the interference
comes from the machines we are using: the many steps required
between the start and finish of the operations can overload the capacity of short-term or working memory.
There are several ways to combat memory-lapse errors. One is to
minimize the number of steps; another, to provide vivid reminders
of steps that need to be completed. A superior method is to use the


**176** _The Design of Everyday Things_


forcing function of Chapter 4. For example, automated teller machines often require removal of the bank card before delivering the
requested money: this prevents forgetting the bank card, capitalizing on the fact that people seldom forget the goal of the activity,
in this case the money. With pens, the solution is simply to prevent
their removal, perhaps by chaining public pens to the counter. Not
all memory-lapse errors lend themselves to simple solutions. In
many cases the interruptions come from outside the system, where
the designer has no control.


**MODE-ERROR SLIPS**


A mode error occurs when a device has different states in which

the same controls have different meanings: we call these states
_modes._ Mode errors are inevitable in anything that has more possible actions than it has controls or displays; that is, the controls
mean different things in the different modes. This is unavoidable
as we add more and more functions to our devices.

Ever turn off the wrong device in your home entertainment system? This happens when one control is used for multiple purposes.
In the home, this is simply frustrating. In industry, the confusion
that results when operators believe the system to be in one mode,
when in reality it is in another, has resulted in serious accidents
and loss of life.

It is tempting to save money and space by having a single control
serve multiple purposes. Suppose there are ten different functions
on a device. Instead of using ten separate knobs or switches—
which would take considerable space, add extra cost, and appear
intimidatingly complex, why not use just two controls, one to select
the function, the other to set the function to the desired condition?
Although the resulting design appears quite simple and easy to
use, this apparent simplicity masks the underlying complexity of
use. The operator must always be completely aware of the mode, of
what function is active. Alas, the prevalence of mode errors shows
this assumption to be false. Yes, if I select a mode and then immediately adjust the parameters, I am not apt to be confused about
the state. But what if I select the mode and then get interrupted


five: _Human Error? No, Bad Design_ **177**


by other events? Or if the mode is maintained for considerable
periods? Or, as in the case of the Airbus accident discussed below, the two modes being selected are very similar in control
and function, but have different operating characteristics, which
means that the resulting mode error is difficult to discover?
Sometimes the use of modes is justifiable, such as the need to
put many controls and displays in a small, restricted space, but
whatever the reason, modes are a common cause of confusion

and error.

Alarm clocks often use the same controls and display for setting
the time of day and the time the alarm should go off, and many
of us have thereby set one when we meant the other. Similarly,
when time is displayed on a twelve-hour scale, it is easy to set the
alarm to go off at seven a.m. only later to discover that the alarm
had been set for seven p.m. The use of “a.m.” and “p.m.” to distin
guish times before and after noon is a common source of confusion and error, hence the common use of 24-hour time specification
throughout most of the world (the major exceptions being North
America, Australia, India, and the Philippines). Watches with multiple functions have similar problems, in this case required because
of the small amount of space available for controls and displays.
Modes exist in most computer programs, in our cell phones, and
in the automatic controls of commercial aircraft. A number of se
rious accidents in commercial aviation can be attributed to mode

errors, especially in aircraft that use automatic systems (which
have a large number of complex modes). As automobiles become
more complex, with the dashboard controls for driving, heating
and air-conditioning, entertainment, and navigation, modes are
increasingly common.
An accident with an Airbus airplane illustrates the problem. The
flight control equipment (often referred to as the automatic pilot)
had two modes, one for controlling vertical speed, the other for
controlling the flight path’s angle of descent. In one case, when the
pilots were attempting to land, the pilots thought that they were
controlling the angle of descent, whereas they had accidentally


**178** _The Design of Everyday Things_


selected the mode that controlled speed of descent. The number
(–3.3) that was entered into the system to represent an appropriate
angle (–3.3º) was too steep a rate of descent when interpreted as
vertical speed (–3,300 feet/minute: –3.3º would only be –800 feet/
minute). This mode confusion contributed to the resulting fatal accident. After a detailed study of the accident, Airbus changed the
display on the instrument so that vertical speed would always be
displayed with a four-digit number and angle with two digits, thus
reducing the chance of confusion.
Mode error is really design error. Mode errors are especially
likely where the equipment does not make the mode visible, so
the user is expected to remember what mode has been established,
sometimes hours earlier, during which time many intervening
events might have occurred. Designers must try to avoid modes,
but if they are necessary, the equipment must make it obvious
which mode is invoked. Once again, designers must always compensate for interfering activities.
