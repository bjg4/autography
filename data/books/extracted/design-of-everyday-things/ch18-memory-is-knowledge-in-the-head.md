**Memory Is Knowledge in the Head**


An old Arabic folk tale, “‘Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” tells
how the poor woodcutter ‘Ali Baba discovered the secret cave of a
band of thieves. ‘Ali Baba overheard the thieves entering the cave
and learned the secret phrase that opened the cave: “Open Simsim.” ( _Simsim_ means “sesame” in Persian, so many versions of the
story translate the phrase as “Open Sesame.”) ‘Ali Baba’s brotherin-law, Kasim, forced him to reveal the secret. Kasim then went to

the cave.


_When he reached the entrance of the cavern, he pronounced the words,_
_Open Simsim!_
_The door immediately opened, and when he was in, closed on him. In_
_examining the cave he was greatly astonished to find much more riches_
_than he had expected from ‘Ali Baba’s relation._
_He quickly laid at the door of the cavern as many bags of gold as his_
_ten mules could carry, but his thoughts were now so full of the great_
_riches he should possess, that he could not think of the necessary words_
_to make the door open. Instead of Open Simsim! he said Open Barley!_
_and was much amazed to find that the door remained shut. He named_
_several sorts of grain, but still the door would not open._
_Kasim never expected such an incident, and was so alarmed at the_
_danger he was in that the more he endeavoured to remember the word_
_Simsim the more his memory was confounded, and he had as much_
_forgotten it as if he had never heard it mentioned._
_Kasim never got out. The thieves returned, cut off Kasim’s head, and_
_quartered his body._ (From Colum’s 1953 edition of _The Arabian Nights._ )


Most of us will not get our head cut off if we fail to remember a
secret code, but it can still be very hard to recall the code. It is one
thing to have to memorize one or two secrets: a combination, or
a password, or the secret to opening a door. But when the number of secret codes gets too large, memory fails. There seems to
be a conspiracy, one calculated to destroy our sanity by overloading our memory. Many codes, such as postal codes and telephone
numbers, exist primarily to make life easier for machines and their


**86** _The Design of Everyday Things_


designers without any consideration of the burden placed upon
people. Fortunately, technology has now permitted most of us
to avoid having to remember this arbitrary knowledge but to let
our technology do it for us: phone numbers, addresses and postal
codes, Internet and e-mail addresses are all retrievable automatically, so we no longer have to learn them. Security codes, however,
are a different matter, and in the never-ending, escalating battle
between the white hats and the black, the good guys and the bad,
the number of different arbitrary codes we must remember or special security devices we must carry with us continues to escalate in
both number and complexity.
Many of these codes must be kept secret. There is no way that
we can learn all those numbers or phrases. Quick: what magical
command was Kasim trying to remember to open the cavern door?
How do most people cope? They use simple passwords. Studies
show that five of the most common passwords are: “password,”
“123456,” “12345678,” “qwerty,” and “abc123.” All of these are
clearly selected for easy remembering and typing. All are therefore
easy for a thief or mischief-maker to try. Most people (including
me) have a small number of passwords that they use on as many
different sites as possible. Even security professionals admit to this,
thereby hypocritically violating their own rules.
Many of the security requirements are unnecessary, and needlessly complex. So why are they required? There are many reasons. One is that there are real problems: criminals impersonate
identities to steal people’s money and possessions. People invade
others’ privacy, for nefarious or even harmless purposes. Professors and teachers need to safeguard examination questions and
grades. For companies and nations, it is important to maintain secrets. There are lots of reasons to keep things behind locked doors
or password-protected walls. The problem, however, is the lack of
proper understanding of human abilities.
We do need protection, but most of the people who enforce
the security requirements at schools, businesses, and government are technologists or possibly law-enforcement officials.
They understand crime, but not human behavior. They believe


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **87**


that “strong” passwords, ones difficult to guess, are required,
and that they must be changed frequently. They do not seem
to recognize that we now need so many passwords—even easy
ones—that it is difficult to remember which goes with which requirement. This creates a new layer of vulnerability.
The more complex the password requirements, the less secure
the system. Why? Because people, unable to remember all these
combinations, write them down. And then where do they store this
private, valuable knowledge? In their wallet, or taped under the
computer keyboard, or wherever it is easy to find, because it is so
frequently needed. So a thief only has to steal the wallet or find the
list and then all secrets are known. Most people are honest, concerned workers. And it is these individuals that complex security
systems impede the most, preventing them from getting their work
done. As a result, it is often the most dedicated employee who violates the security rules and weakens the overall system.
When I was doing the research for this chapter, I found numerous examples of secure passwords that force people to use insecure
memory devices for them. One post on the “Mail Online” forum of
the British _Daily Mail_ newspaper described the technique:


_When I used to work for the local government organisation we HAD_
_TO change our Passwords every three months. To ensure I could_

_remember it, I used to write it on a Post-It note and stick it above_

_my desk._


How can we remember all these secret things? Most of us can’t,
even with the use of mnemonics to make some sense of nonsensi
cal material. Books and courses on improving memory can work,
but the methods are laborious to learn and need continual practice
to maintain. So we put the memory in the world, writing things
down in books, on scraps of paper, even on the backs of our hands.
But we disguise them to thwart would-be thieves. That creates another problem: How do we disguise the items, how do we hide
them, and how do we remember what the disguise was or where
we put it? Ah, the foibles of memory.


**88** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Where should you hide something so that nobody else will find
it? In unlikely places, right? Money is hidden in the freezer; jewelry in the medicine cabinet or in shoes in the closet. The key to
the front door is hidden under the mat or just below the window
ledge. The car key is under the bumper. The love letters are in a
flower vase. The problem is, there aren’t that many unlikely places
in the home. You may not remember where the love letters or keys
are hidden, but your burglar will. Two psychologists who examined the issue described the problem this way:


_There is often a logic involved in the choice of unlikely places. For exam-_
_ple, a friend of ours was required by her insurance company to acquire_
_a safe if she wished to insure her valuable gems. Recognizing that she_
_might forget the combination to the safe, she thought carefully about_
_where to keep the combination. Her solution was to write it in her per-_
_sonal phone directory under the letter S next to “Mr. and Mrs. Safe,” as_
_if it were a telephone number. There is a clear logic here: Store numer-_
_ical information with other numerical information. She was appalled,_
_however, when she heard a reformed burglar on a daytime television_
_talk show say that upon encountering a safe, he always headed for the_
_phone directory because many people keep the combination there._ (From


Winograd & Soloway, 1986, “On Forgetting the Locations of Things Stored in


Special Places.” Reprinted with permission.)


All the arbitrary things we need to remember add up to unwitting tyranny. It is time for a revolt. But before we revolt, it is important to know the solution. As noted earlier, one of my self-imposed
rules is, “Never criticize unless you have a better alternative.” In
this case, it is not clear what the better system might be.
Some things can only be solved by massive cultural changes,
which probably means they will never be solved. For example,
take the problem of identifying people by their names. People’s
names evolved over many thousands of years, originally simply
to distinguish people within families and groups who lived together. The use of multiple names (given names and surnames)
is relatively recent, and even those do not distinguish one person


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **89**


from all the seven billion in the world. Do we write the given name
first, or the surname? It depends upon what country you are in.
How many names does a person have? How many characters in
a name? What characters are legitimate? For example, can a name
include a digit? (I know people who have tried to use such names
as “h3nry.” I know of a company named “Autonom3.”)
How does a name translate from one alphabet to another? Some
of my Korean friends have given names that are identical when
written in the Korean alphabet, Hangul, but that are different
when transliterated into English.
Many people change their names when they get married or
divorced, and in some cultures, when they pass significant life
events. A quick search on the Internet reveals multiple questions
from people in Asia who are confused about how to fill out American or European passport forms because their names don’t correspond to the requirements.
And what happens when a thief steals a person’s identity, masquerading as the other individual, using his or her money and
credit? In the United States, these identity thieves can also apply
for income tax rebates and get them, and when the legitimate taxpayers try to get their legitimate refund, they are told they already
received it.

I once attended a meeting of security experts that was held at
the corporate campus of Google. Google, like most corporations,
is very protective of its processes and advanced research projects,
so most of the buildings were locked and guarded. Attendees of
the security meeting were not allowed access (except those who
worked at Google, of course). Our meetings were held in a conference room in the public space of an otherwise secure building.
But the toilets were all located inside a secure area. How did we

manage? These world-famous, leading authorities on security figured out a solution: They found a brick and used it to prop open
the door leading into the secure area. So much for security: Make
something too secure, and it becomes less secure.
How do we solve these problems? How do we guarantee people’s access to their own records, bank accounts, and computer


**90** _The Design of Everyday Things_


systems? Almost any scheme you can imagine has already been
proposed, studied, and found to have defects. Biometric markers
(iris or retina patterns, fingerprints, voice recognition, body type,
DNA)? All can be forged or the systems’ databases manipulated.
Once someone manages to fool the system, what recourse is there?
It isn’t possible to change biometric markers, so once they point to
the wrong person, changes are extremely difficult to make.
The strength of a password is actually pretty irrelevant because
most passwords are obtained through “key loggers” or are stolen.
A key logger is software hidden within your computer system that
records what you type and sends it to the bad guys. When computer
systems are broken into, millions of passwords might get stolen, and
even if they are encrypted, the bad guys can often decrypt them. In
both these cases, however secure the password, the bad guys know
what it is.

The safest methods require multiple identifiers, the most common schemes requiring at least two different kinds: “something
you have” plus “something you know.” The “something you have”
is often a physical identifier, such as a card or key, perhaps even
something implanted under the skin or a biometric identifier, such
as fingerprints or patterns of the eye’s iris. The “something you
know” would be knowledge in the head, most likely something
memorized. The memorized item doesn’t have to be as secure as to
day’s passwords because it wouldn’t work without the “something
you have.” Some systems allow for a second, alerting password, so
that if the bad guys try to force someone to enter a password into
a system, the individual would use the alerting one, which would
warn the authorities of an illegal entry.
Security poses major design issues, ones that involve complex
technology as well as human behavior. There are deep, fundamental
difficulties. Is there a solution? No, not yet. We will probably be stuck
with these complexities for a long time.
