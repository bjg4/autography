**Approximate Models: Memory in the Real World**


Conscious thinking takes time and mental resources. Well-learned
skills bypass the need for conscious oversight and control: conscious control is only required for initial learning and for dealing
with unexpected situations. Continual practice automates the
action cycle, minimizing the amount of conscious thinking and
problem-solving required to act. Most expert, skilled behavior


**100** _The Design of Everyday Things_


works this way, whether it is playing tennis or a musical instrument, or doing mathematics and science. Experts minimize the
need for conscious reasoning. Philosopher and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead stated this principle over a century ago:


_It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by_
_eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should culti-_
_vate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is_
_the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important_
_operations which we can perform without thinking about them._ (Alfred


North Whitehead, 1911.)


One way to simplify thought is to use simplified models, approximations to the true underlying state of affairs. Science deals
in truth, practice deals with approximations. Practitioners don’t
need truth: they need results relatively quickly that, although inaccurate, are “good enough” for the purpose to which they will be
applied. Consider these examples:


**EXAMPLE 1: CONVERTING TEMPERATURES**

**BETWEEN FAHRENHEIT AND CELSIUS**


It is now 55°F outside my home in California. What temperature is
it in Celsius? Quick, do it in your head without using any technology: What is the answer?
I am sure all of you remember the conversion equation:


°C = (°F–32) × 5 / 9


Plug in 55 for °F, and ºC = (55–32) × 5 / 9 = 12.8°. But most people
can’t do this without pencil and paper because there are too many
intermediate numbers to maintain in STM.

Want a simpler way? Try this approximation—you can do it in
your head, there is no need for paper or pencil:


°C = (°F–30) / 2


Plug in 55 for °F, and ºC = (55–30) / 2 = 12.5º. Is the equation an
exact conversion? No, but the approximate answer of 12.5 is close


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **101**


enough to the correct value of 12.8. After all, I simply wanted to
know whether I should wear a sweater. Anything within 5ºF of the
real value would work for this purpose.
Approximate answers are often good enough, even if technically
wrong. This simple approximation method for temperature conversion is “good enough” for temperatures in the normal range
of interior and outside temperatures: it is within 3ºF (or 1.7ºC) in
the range of –5° to 25ºC (20° to 80ºF). It gets further off at lower or
higher temperatures, but for everyday use, it is wonderful. Approximations are good enough for practical use.


**EXAMPLE 2: A MODEL OF SHORT-TERM MEMORY**


Here is an approximate model for STM:


_There are five memory slots in short-term memory. Each time a new_
_item is added, it occupies a slot, knocking out whatever was there_
_beforehand._


Is this model true? No, not a single memory researcher in the
entire world believes this to be an accurate model of STM. But it is

good enough for applications. Make use of this model, and your
designs will be more usable.


**EXAMPLE 3: STEERING A MOTORCYCLE**


In the preceding section, we learned how Professor Sayeki mapped
the turning directions of his motorcycle to his turn signals, enabling
him to remember their correct usage. But there, I also pointed out
that the conceptual model was wrong.
Why is the conceptual model for steering a motorcycle useful
even though it is wrong? Steering a motorcycle is counterintuitive:
to turn to the left, the handlebars must first be turned to the right.
This is called countersteering, and it violates most people’s conceptual models. Why is this true? Shouldn’t we rotate the handlebars
left to turn the bike left? The most important component of turning
a two-wheeled vehicle is lean: when the bike is turning left, the
rider is leaning to the left. Countersteering causes the rider to lean


**102** _The Design of Everyday Things_


properly: when the handlebars are turned to the right, the resulting
forces upon the rider cause the body to lean left. This weight shift
then causes the bike to turn left.

Experienced riders often do the correct operations subconsciously, unaware that they start a turn by rotating the handlebars
opposite from the intended direction, thus violating their own
conceptual models. Motorcycle training courses have to conduct
special exercises to convince riders that this is what they are doing.
You can test this counterintuitive concept on a bicycle or motorcycle by getting up to a comfortable speed, placing the palm of the
hand on the end of the left handlebar, and gently pushing it forward.
The handlebars and front wheel will turn to the right and the body
will lean to the left, resulting in the bike—and the handlebars—
turning to the left.
Professor Sayeki was fully aware of this contradiction between
his mental scheme and reality, but he wanted his memory aid to
match his conceptual model. Conceptual models are powerful explanatory devices, useful in a variety of circumstances. They do
not have to be accurate as long as they lead to the correct behavior
in the desired situation.


**EXAMPLE 4: “GOOD ENOUGH” ARITHMETIC**


Most of us can’t multiply two large numbers in our head: we forget
where we are along the way. Memory experts can multiply two
large numbers quickly and effortlessly in their heads, amazing audiences with their skills. Moreover, the numbers come out left to
right, the way we use them, not right to left, as we write them while
laboriously using pencil and paper to compute the answers. These
experts use special techniques that minimize the load on working
memory, but they do so at the cost of having to learn numerous
special methods for different ranges and forms of problems.
Isn’t this something we should all learn? Why aren’t school
systems teaching this? My answer is simple: Why bother? I can
estimate the answer in my head with reasonable accuracy, often
good enough for the purpose. When I need precision and accuracy,
well, that’s what calculators are for.


three: _Knowledge in the Head and in the World_ **103**


Remember my earlier example, to multiply 27 times 293 in your
head? Why would anyone need to know the precise answer?
an approximate answer is good enough, and pretty easy to get.
Change 27 to 30, and 293 to 300: 30 × 300 = 9,000 (3 × 3 = 9, and
add back the three zeros). The accurate answer is 7,911, so the estimate of 9,000 is only 14 percent too large. In many instances, this
is good enough. Want a bit more accuracy? We changed 27 to 30
to make the multiplication easier. That’s 3 too large. So subtract
3 × 300 from the answer (9,000 – 900). Now we get 8,100, which is
accurate within 2 percent.
It is rare that we need to know the answers to complex arithmetic
problems with great precision: almost always, a rough estimate is
good enough. When precision is required, use a calculator. That’s
what machines are good for: providing great precision. For most
purposes, estimates are good enough. Machines should focus on
solving arithmetic problems. People should focus on higher-level
issues, such as the reason the answer was needed.
Unless it is your ambition to become a nightclub performer and
amaze people with great skills of memory, here is a simpler way
to dramatically enhance both memory and accuracy: write things
down. Writing is a powerful technology: why not use it? Use a pad
of paper, or the back of your hand. Write it or type it. Use a phone
or a computer. Dictate it. This is what technology is for.
The unaided mind is surprisingly limited. It is things that make
us smart. Take advantage of them.


**SCIENTIFIC THEORY VERSUS EVERYDAY PRACTICE**


Science strives for truth. As a result, scientists are always debating,
arguing, and disagreeing with one another. The scientific method
is one of debate and conflict. Only ideas that have passed through
the critical examination of multiple other scientists survive. This
continual disagreement often seems strange to the nonscientist, for
it appears that scientists don’t know anything. Select almost any
topic, and you will discover that scientists who work in that area
are continually disagreeing.


**104** _The Design of Everyday Things_


But the disagreements are illusory. That is, most scientists usually agree about the broad details: their disagreements are often
about tiny details that are important for distinguishing between
two competing theories, but that might have very little impact in
the real world of practice and applications.
In the real, practical world, we don’t need absolute truth: approximate models work just fine. Professor Sayeki’s simplified
conceptual model of steering his motorcycle enabled him to remember which way to move the switches for his turn signals;
the simplified equation for temperature conversion and the simplified model of approximate arithmetic enabled “good enough”
answers in the head. The simplified model of STM provides
useful design guidance, even if it is scientifically wrong. Each of
these approximations is wrong, yet all are valuable in minimizing
thought, resulting in quick, easy results whose accuracy is “good
enough.”
