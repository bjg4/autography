###### KNOWLEDGE IN THE HEAD AND IN THE WORLD


_A friend kindly let me borrow his car, an older, classic Saab. Just before_
_I was about to leave, I found a note waiting for me: “I should have_
_mentioned that to get the key out of the ignition, the car needs to be in_
_reverse.” The car needs to be in reverse! If I hadn’t seen the note, I never_
_could have figured that out. There was no visible cue in the car: the_
_knowledge needed for this trick had to reside in the head. If the driver_
_lacks that knowledge, the key stays in the ignition forever._


Every day we are confronted by numerous objects,
devices, and services, each of which requires us to
behave or act in some particular manner. Overall, we
manage quite well. Our knowledge is often quite incomplete, ambiguous, or even wrong, but that doesn’t matter: we
still get through the day just fine. How do we manage? We combine knowledge in the head with knowledge in the world. Why
combine? Because neither alone will suffice.

It is easy to demonstrate the faulty nature of human knowledge
and memory. The psychologists Ray Nickerson and Marilyn Adams
showed that people do not remember what common coins look
like (Figure 3.1). Even though the example is for the American onecent piece, the penny, the finding holds true for currencies across
the world. But despite our ignorance of the coins’ appearance, we
use our money properly.
Why the apparent discrepancy between the precision of behavior
and the imprecision of knowledge? Because not all of the knowl

**FIGURE 3.1.** **Which Is the US One-Cent Coin, the Penny?** Fewer than half of the
American college students who were given this set of drawings and asked to select the
correct image could do so. Pretty bad performance, except that the students, of course,
have no difficulty using the money. In normal life, we have to distinguish between the
penny and other coins, not among several versions of one denomination. Although
this is an old study using American coins, the results still hold true today using coins
of any currency. (From Nickerson & Adams, 1979, _Cognitive Psychology_, 11 (3). Reproduced with

edge required for precise behavior has to be in the head. It can be
distributed—partly in the head, partly in the world, and partly in
the constraints of the world.
