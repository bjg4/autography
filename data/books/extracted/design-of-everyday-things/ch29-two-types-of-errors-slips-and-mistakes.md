**Two Types of Errors: Slips and Mistakes**


Many years ago, the British psychologist James Reason and I developed a general classification of human error. We divided human
error into two major categories: slips and mistakes (Figure 5.1). This
classification has proved to be of value for both theory and practice.
It is widely used in the study of error in such diverse areas as industrial and aviation accidents, and medical errors. The discussion gets
a little technical, so I have kept technicalities to a minimum. This
topic is of extreme importance to design, so stick with it.


**DEFINITIONS: ERRORS, SLIPS, AND MISTAKES**


Human error is defined as any deviance from “appropriate” behavior. The word _appropriate_ is in quotes because in many circumstances, the appropriate behavior is not known or is only deter

**FIGURE 5.1.** **Classification of**
**Errors.** Errors have two major
forms. Slips occur when the goal
is correct, but the required actions
are not done properly: the execution is flawed. Mistakes occur
when the goal or plan is wrong.
Slips and mistakes can be further
divided based upon their underlying causes. Memory lapses can
lead to either slips or mistakes,
depending upon whether the
memory failure was at the highest
level of cognition (mistakes) or at
lower (subconscious) levels (slips).
Although deliberate violations of
procedures are clearly inappropriate behaviors that often lead to ac
cidents, these are not considered as
errors (see discussion in text).

mined after the fact. But still, error is defined as deviance from the
generally accepted correct or appropriate behavior.
_Error_ is the general term for all wrong actions. There are two major classes of error: _slips_ and _mistakes_, as shown in Figure 5.1; slips
are further divided into two major classes and mistakes into three.
These categories of errors all have different implications for design.
I now turn to a more detailed look at these classes of errors and

their design implications.


**SLIPS**


A slip occurs when a person intends to do one action and ends up
doing something else. With a slip, the action performed is not the
same as the action that was intended.

There are two major classes of slips: _action-based_ and _memory-lapse._
In action-based slips, the wrong action is performed. In lapses,
memory fails, so the intended action is not done or its results not
evaluated. Action-based slips and memory lapses can be further
classified according to their causes.


**Example of an action-based slip.** I poured some milk into my coffee
and then put the coffee cup into the refrigerator. This is the correct
action applied to the wrong object.
**Example of a memory-lapse slip.** I forget to turn off the gas burner on
my stove after cooking dinner.


**MISTAKES**


A mistake occurs when the wrong goal is established or the wrong
plan is formed. From that point on, even if the actions are executed
properly they are part of the error, because the actions themselves are
inappropriate—they are part of the wrong plan. With a mistake, the
action that is performed matches the plan: it is the plan that is wrong.
Mistakes have three major classes: _rule-based, knowledge-based,_
and _memory-lapse._ In a rule-based mistake, the person has appropriately diagnosed the situation, but then decided upon an erroneous course of action: the wrong rule is being followed. In a
knowledge-based mistake, the problem is misdiagnosed because

of erroneous or incomplete knowledge. Memory-lapse mistakes
take place when there is forgetting at the stages of goals, plans,
or evaluation. Two of the mistakes leading to the “Gimli Glider”
Boeing 767 emergency landing were:


**Example of knowledge-based mistake.** Weight of fuel was computed
in pounds instead of kilograms.
**Example of memory-lapse mistake.** A mechanic failed to complete
troubleshooting because of distraction.


**ERROR AND THE SEVEN STAGES OF ACTION**


Errors can be understood through reference to the seven stages
of the action cycle of Chapter 2 (Figure 5.2). Mistakes are errors in setting the goal or plan, and in comparing results with
expectations—the higher levels of cognition. Slips happen in
the execution of a plan, or in the perception or interpretation of
the outcome—the lower stages. Memory lapses can happen at any
of the eight transitions between stages, shown by the X’s in Figure
5.2B. A memory lapse at one of these transitions stops the action
cycle from proceeding, and so the desired action is not completed.


**A.** **B.**


**FIGURE 5.2.** **Where Slips and Mistakes Originate in the Action Cycle.** Figure A
shows that action slips come from the bottom four stages of the action cycle and mistakes from the top three stages. Memory lapses impact the transitions between stages
(shown by the X’s in Figure B). Memory lapses at the higher levels lead to mistakes, and
lapses at the lower levels lead to slips.

Slips are the result of subconscious actions getting waylaid en
route. Mistakes result from conscious deliberations. The same processes that make us creative and insightful by allowing us to see
relationships between apparently unrelated things, that let us leap
to correct conclusions on the basis of partial or even faulty evidence, also lead to mistakes. Our ability to generalize from small
amounts of information helps tremendously in new situations; but
sometimes we generalize too rapidly, classifying a new situation
as similar to an old one when, in fact, there are significant discrepancies. This leads to mistakes that can be difficult to discover, let

alone eliminate.
