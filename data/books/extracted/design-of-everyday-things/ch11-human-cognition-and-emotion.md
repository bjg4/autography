**Human Cognition and Emotion**


The mind and brain are complex entities, still the topic of considerable scientific research. One valuable explanation of the levels of processing within the brain, applicable to both cognitive
and emotional processing, is to think of three different levels of
processing, each quite different from the other, but all working
together in concert. Although this is a gross oversimplification
of the actual processing, it is a good enough approximation to
provide guidance in understanding human behavior. The approach
I use here comes from my book _Emotional Design_ . There, I suggested

that a useful approximate model of human cognition and emotion
is to consider three levels of processing: visceral, behavioral, and
reflective.


**THE VISCERAL LEVEL**


The most basic level of processing is called _visceral._ This is sometimes referred to as “the lizard brain.” All people have the same basic visceral responses. These are part of the basic protective mechanisms of the human affective system, making quick judgments
about the environment: good or bad, safe or dangerous. The visceral
system allows us to respond quickly and subconsciously, without
conscious awareness or control.

The basic biology of the visceral
system minimizes its ability to
learn. Visceral learning takes
place primarily by sensitization
or desensitization through such
mechanisms as adaptation and
classical conditioning. Visceral
responses are fast and automatic.

environments, dislike of bitter
tastes and the liking of sweet tastes, and so on. Note that the visceral
level responds to the immediate present and produces an affective
state, relatively unaffected by context or history. It simply assesses
the situation: no cause is assigned, no blame, and no credit.
The visceral level is tightly coupled to the body’s musculature—
the motor system. This is what causes animals to fight or flee, or to
relax. An animal’s (or person’s) visceral state can often be read by
analyzing the tension of the body: tense means a negative state; relaxed, a positive state. Note, too, that we often determine our own
body state by noting our own musculature. A common self-report


**50** _The Design of Everyday Things_


might be something like, “I was tense, my fists clenched, and I
was sweating.”
Visceral responses are fast and completely subconscious. They
are sensitive only to the current state of things. Most scientists do
not call these emotions: they are precursors to emotion. Stand at
the edge of a cliff and you will experience a visceral response. Or
bask in the warm, comforting glow after a pleasant experience,
perhaps a nice meal.
For designers, the visceral response is about immediate perception: the pleasantness of a mellow, harmonious sound or the
jarring, irritating scratch of fingernails on a rough surface. Here
is where the style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight,
touch or smell, drive the visceral response. This has nothing to do
with how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is
all about attraction or repulsion. Great designers use their aesthetic
sensibilities to drive these visceral responses.
Engineers and other logical people tend to dismiss the visceral
response as irrelevant. Engineers are proud of the inherent quality of their work and dismayed when inferior products sell better
“just because they look better.” But all of us make these kinds of
judgments, even those very logical engineers. That’s why they love
some of their tools and dislike others. Visceral responses matter.


**THE BEHAVIORAL LEVEL**


The _behavioral_ level is the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns. Actions and analyses
at this level are largely subconscious. Even though we are usually
aware of our actions, we are often unaware of the details. When we
speak, we often do not know what we are about to say until our
conscious mind (the reflective part of the mind) hears ourselves
uttering the words. When we play a sport, we are prepared for action, but our responses occur far too quickly for conscious control:
it is the behavioral level that takes control.

When we perform a well-learned action, all we have to do is
think of the goal and the behavioral level handles all the details:
the conscious mind has little or no awareness beyond creating the

desire to act. It’s actually interesting to keep trying it. Move the left
hand, then the right. Stick out your tongue, or open your mouth.
What did you do? You don’t know. All you know is that you
“willed” the action and the correct thing happened. You can even
make the actions more complex. Pick up a cup, and then with the
same hand, pick up several more items. You automatically adjust
the fingers and the hand’s orientation to make the task possible.
You only need to pay conscious attention if the cup holds some liquid that you wish to avoid spilling. But even in that case, the actual
control of the muscles is beneath conscious perception: concentrate
on not spilling and the hands automatically adjust.
For designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioral level is
that every action is associated with an expectation. Expect a positive
outcome and the result is a positive affective response (a “positive valence,” in the scientific literature). Expect a negative outcome
and the result is a negative affective response (a negative valence):
dread and hope, anxiety and anticipation. The information in the
feedback loop of evaluation confirms or disconfirms the expectations, resulting in satisfaction or relief, disappointment or frustration.
Behavioral states are learned. They give rise to a feeling of control when there is good understanding and knowledge of results,
and frustration and anger when things do not go as planned, and
especially when neither the reason nor the possible remedies are
known. Feedback provides reassurance, even when it indicates a
negative result. A lack of feedback creates a feeling of lack of control, which can be unsettling. Feedback is critical to managing expectations, and good design provides this. Feedback—knowledge
of results—is how expectations are resolved and is critical to learning and the development of skilled behavior.
Expectations play an important role in our emotional lives. This
is why drivers tense when trying to get through an intersection before the light turns red, or students become highly anxious before
an exam. The release of the tension of expectation creates a sense of
relief. The emotional system is especially responsive to changes in
states—so an upward change is interpreted positively even if it is
only from a very bad state to a not-so-bad state, just as a change is


**52** _The Design of Everyday Things_


interpreted negatively even if it is from an extremely positive state
to one only somewhat less positive.


**THE REFLECTIVE LEVEL**


The _reflective_ level is the home of conscious cognition. As a consequence, this is where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place. The visceral and
behavioral levels are subconscious and, as a result, they respond
rapidly, but without much analysis. Reflection is cognitive, deep,
and slow. It often occurs after the events have happened. It is a reflection or looking back over them, evaluating the circumstances,
actions, and outcomes, often assessing blame or responsibility. The
highest levels of emotions come from the reflective level, for it is
here that causes are assigned and where predictions of the future
take place. Adding causal elements to experienced events leads to
such emotional states as guilt and pride (when we assume ourselves to be the cause) and blame and praise (when others are
thought to be the cause). Most of us have probably experienced the
extreme highs and lows of anticipated future events, all imagined
by a runaway reflective cognitive system but intense enough to
create the physiological responses associated with extreme anger
or pleasure. Emotion and cognition are tightly intertwined.


**DESIGN MUST TAKE PLACE AT ALL LEVELS:**

**VISCERAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND REFLECTIVE**


To the designer, reflection is perhaps the most important of the
levels of processing. Reflection is conscious, and the emotions
produced at this level are the most protracted: those that assign
agency and cause, such as guilt and blame or praise and pride. Reflective responses are part of our memory of events. Memories last
far longer than the immediate experience or the period of usage,
which are the domains of the visceral and behavioral levels. It is

reflection that drives us to recommend a product, to recommend
that others use it—or perhaps to avoid it.
Reflective memories are often more important than reality. If
we have a strongly positive visceral response but disappointing


two: _The Psychology of Everyday Actions_ **53**


usability problems at the behavioral level, when we reflect back
upon the product, the reflective level might very well weigh the
positive response strongly enough to overlook the severe behavioral difficulties (hence the phrase, “Attractive things work better”). Similarly, too much frustration, especially toward the ending
stage of use, and our reflections about the experience might overlook the positive visceral qualities. Advertisers hope that the strong
reflective value associated with a well-known, highly prestigious
brand might overwhelm our judgment, despite a frustrating experience in using the product. Vacations are often remembered with
fondness, despite the evidence from diaries of repeated discomfort
and anguish.
All three levels of processing work together. All play essential
roles in determining a person’s like or dislike of a product or service. One nasty experience with a service provider can spoil all
future experiences. One superb experience can make up for past
deficiencies. The behavioral level, which is the home of interaction,
is also the home of all expectation-based emotions, of hope and joy,
frustration and anger. Understanding arises at a combination of
the behavioral and reflective levels. Enjoyment requires all three.
Designing at all three levels is so important that I devote an entire
book to the topic, _Emotional Design._
In psychology, there has been a long debate about which happens first: emotion or cognition. Do we run and flee because some
event happened that made us afraid? Or are we afraid because
our conscious, reflective mind notices that we are running? The
three-level analysis shows that both of these ideas can be correct.
Sometimes the emotion comes first. An unexpected loud noise can
cause automatic visceral and behavioral responses that make us
flee. Then, the reflective system observes itself fleeing and deduces
that it is afraid. The actions of running and fleeing occur first and
set off the interpretation of fear.
But sometimes cognition occurs first. Suppose the street where
we are walking leads to a dark and narrow section. Our reflective
system might conjure numerous imagined threats that await us.
At some point, the imagined depiction of potential harm is large


**54** _The Design of Everyday Things_


enough to trigger the behavioral system, causing us to turn, run, and
flee. Here is where the cognition sets off the fear and the action.
Most products do not cause fear, running, or fleeing, but badly
designed devices can induce frustration and anger, a feeling of
helplessness and despair, and possibly even hate. Well-designed
devices can induce pride and enjoyment, a feeling of being in control and pleasure—possibly even love and attachment. Amusement parks are experts at balancing the conflicting responses of
the emotional stages, providing rides and fun houses that trigger
fear responses from the visceral and behavioral levels, while all
the time providing reassurance at the reflective level that the park
would never subject anyone to real danger.
All three levels of processing work together to determine a person’s cognitive and emotional state. High-level reflective cognition
can trigger lower-level emotions. Lower-level emotions can trigger
higher-level reflective cognition.
