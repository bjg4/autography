###### PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION

In the first edition of this book, then called POET, _The Psychology_
_of Everyday Things_, I started with these lines: “This is the book I
always wanted to write, except I didn’t know it.” Today I do know
it, so I simply say, “This is the book I always wanted to write.”
This is a starter kit for good design. It is intended to be enjoyable and informative for everyone: everyday people, technical people, designers, and nondesigners. One goal is to turn readers into
great observers of the absurd, of the poor design that gives rise
to so many of the problems of modern life, especially of modern
technology. It will also turn them into observers of the good, of
the ways in which thoughtful designers have worked to make our
lives easier and smoother. Good design is actually a lot harder to
notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs
so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing
attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its
inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.
Along the way I lay out the fundamental principles required
to eliminate problems, to turn our everyday stuff into enjoyable
products that provide pleasure and satisfaction. The combination
of good observation skills and good design principles is a powerful



**xi**


tool, one that everyone can use, even people who are not professional designers. Why? Because we are all designers in the sense
that all of us deliberately design our lives, our rooms, and the way
we do things. We can also design workarounds, ways of overcoming the flaws of existing devices. So, one purpose of this book is to
give back your control over the products in your life: to know how
to select usable and understandable ones, to know how to fix those

that aren’t so usable or understandable.

The first edition of the book has lived a long and healthy life. Its
name was quickly changed to _Design of Everyday Things_ (DOET)
to make the title less cute and more descriptive. DOET has been
read by the general public and by designers. It has been assigned
in courses and handed out as required readings in many companies. Now, more than twenty years after its release, the book is
still popular. I am delighted by the response and by the number
of people who correspond with me about it, who send me further
examples of thoughtless, inane design, plus occasional examples
of superb design. Many readers have told me that it has changed
their lives, making them more sensitive to the problems of life and
to the needs of people. Some changed their careers and became
designers because of the book. The response has been amazing.


**Why a Revised Edition?**


In the twenty-five years that have passed since the first edition
of the book, technology has undergone massive change. Neither
cell phones nor the Internet were in widespread usage when I
wrote the book. Home networks were unheard of. Moore’s law

proclaims that the power of computer processors doubles roughly
every two years. This means that today’s computers are five thousand times more powerful than the ones available when the book
was first written.

Although the fundamental design principles of _The Design of_
_Everyday Things_ are still as true and as important as when the first
edition was written, the examples were badly out of date. “What
is a slide projector?” students ask. Even if nothing else was to be
changed, the examples had to be updated.


**xii** _Preface to the Revised Edition_


The principles of effective design also had to be brought up to
date. Human-centered design (HCD) has emerged since the first
edition, partially inspired by that book. This current edition has
an entire chapter devoted to the HCD process of product development. The first edition of the book focused upon making products understandable and usable. The total experience of a product
covers much more than its usability: aesthetics, pleasure, and fun
play critically important roles. There was no discussion of pleasure, enjoyment, or emotion. Emotion is so important that I wrote
an entire book, _Emotional Design,_ about the role it plays in design _._
These issues are also now included in this edition.

My experiences in industry have taught me about the complexities of the real world, how cost and schedules are critical,
the need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of
multi disciplinary teams. I learned that the successful product has
to appeal to customers, and the criteria they use to determine what
to purchase may have surprisingly little overlap with the aspects
that are important during usage. The best products do not always
succeed. Brilliant new technologies might take decades to become
accepted. To understand products, it is not enough to understand
design or technology: it is critical to understand business.


**What Has Changed?**


For readers familiar with the earlier edition of this book, here is a
brief review of the changes.
What has changed? Not much. Everything.
When I started, I assumed that the basic principles were still
true, so all I needed to do was update the examples. But in the
end, I rewrote everything. Why? Because although all the principles still applied, in the twenty-five years since the first edition,
much has been learned. I also now know which parts were difficult and therefore need better explanations. In the interim, I also
wrote many articles and six books on related topics, some of which
I thought important to include in the revision. For example, the
original book says nothing of what has come to be called _user_
_experience_ (a term that I was among the first to use, when in the


_Preface to the Revised Edition_ **xiii**


early 1990s, the group I headed at Apple called itself “the User
Experience Architect’s Office”). This needed to be here.
Finally, my exposure to industry taught me much about the way
products actually get deployed, so I added considerable information about the impact of budgets, schedules, and competitive
pressures. When I wrote the original book, I was an academic researcher. Today, I have been an industry executive (Apple, HP, and
some startups), a consultant to numerous companies, and a board
member of companies. I had to include my learnings from these
experiences.
Finally, one important component of the original edition was
its brevity. The book could be read quickly as a basic, general
introduction. I kept that feature unchanged. I tried to delete as
much as I added to keep the total size about the same (I failed).
The book is meant to be an introduction: advanced discussions of

the topics, as well as a large number of important but more advanced topics, have been left out to maintain the compactness. The
previous edition lasted from 1988 to 2013. If the new edition is to
last as long, 2013 to 2038, I had to be careful to choose examples
that would not be dated twenty-five years from now. As a result,
I have tried not to give specific company examples. After all, who
remembers the companies of twenty-five years ago? Who can
predict what new companies will arise, what existing companies
will disappear, and what new technologies will arise in the next
twenty-five years? The one thing I can predict with certainty is that
the principles of human psychology will remain the same, which
means that the design principles here, based on psychology, on the
nature of human cognition, emotion, action, and interaction with
the world, will remain unchanged.
Here is a brief summary of the changes, chapter by chapter.


**Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things**


Signifiers are the most important addition to the chapter, a concept first introduced in my book _Living with Complexity_ . The first
edition had a focus upon affordances, but although affordances


**xiv** _Preface to the Revised Edition_


make sense for interaction with physical objects, they are confusing when dealing with virtual ones. As a result, affordances
have created much confusion in the world of design. Affordances define what actions are possible. Signifiers specify how
people discover those possibilities: signifiers are signs, perceptible signals of what can be done. Signifiers are of far more importance to designers than are affordances. Hence, the extended

treatment.

I added a very brief section on HCD, a term that didn’t yet exist
when the first edition was published, although looking back, we
see that the entire book was about HCD.

Other than that, the chapter is the same, and although all the
photographs and drawings are new, the examples are pretty much
the same.


**Chapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions**


The chapter has one major addition to the coverage in the first edition: the addition of emotion. The seven-stage model of action has
proven to be influential, as has the three-level model of processing
(introduced in my book _Emotional Design_ ). In this chapter I show
the interplay between these two, show that different emotions
arise at the different stages, and show which stages are primarily
located at each of the three levels of processing (visceral, for the
elementary levels of motor action performance and perception; behavioral, for the levels of action specification and initial interpretation of the outcome; and reflective, for the development of goals,
plans, and the final stage of evaluation of the outcome).


**Chapter 3: Knowledge in the Head and in the World**


Aside from improved and updated examples, the most important
addition to this chapter is a section on culture, which is of special
importance to my discussion of “natural mappings.” What seems
natural in one culture may not be in another. The section examines
the way different cultures view time—the discussion might surprise you.


_Preface to the Revised Edition_ **xv**


**Chapter. 4: Knowing What to Do:**
**Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback**


Few substantive changes. Better examples. The elaboration of forcing functions into two kinds: lock-in and lockout. And a section
on destination control elevators, illustrating how change can be
extremely disconcerting, even to professionals, even if the change
is for the better.


**Chapter 5: Human Error? No, Bad Design**


The basics are unchanged, but the chapter itself has been heavily
revised. I update the classification of errors to fit advances since
the publication of the first edition. In particular, I now divide slips
into two main categories—action-based and memory lapses; and
mistakes into three categories—rule-based, knowledge-based,
and memory lapses. (These distinctions are now common, but I
introduce a slightly different way to treat memory lapses.)
Although the multiple classifications of slips provided in the
first edition are still valid, many have little or no implications for
design, so they have been eliminated from the revision. I provide
more design-relevant examples. I show the relationship of the classification of errors, slips, and mistakes to the seven-stage model of
action, something new in this revision.
The chapter concludes with a quick discussion of the difficulties
posed by automation (from my book _The_ _Design of Future Things_ )
and what I consider the best new approach to deal with design
so as to either eliminate or minimize human error: resilience

engineering.


**Chapter 6: Design Thinking**


This chapter is completely new. I discuss two views of humancentered design: the British Design Council’s double-diamond
model and the traditional HCD iteration of observation, ideation, prototyping, and testing. The first diamond is the divergence, followed by convergence, of possibilities to determine
the appropriate problem. The second diamond is a divergenceconvergence to determine an appropriate solution. I introduce


**xvi** _Preface to the Revised Edition_


activity-centered design as a more appropriate variant of humancentered design in many circumstances. These sections cover
the theory.
The chapter then takes a radical shift in position, starting with a
section entitled “What I Just Told You? It Doesn’t Really Work That
Way.” Here is where I introduce Norman’s Law: The day the product team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.
I discuss challenges of design within a company, where schedules, budgets, and the competing requirements of the different
divisions all provide severe constraints upon what can be accomplished. Readers from industry have told me that they welcome
these sections, which capture the real pressures upon them.
The chapter concludes with a discussion of the role of standards
(modified from a similar discussion in the earlier edition), plus
some more general design guidelines.


**Chapter 7: Design in the World of Business**


This chapter is also completely new, continuing the theme started
in Chapter 6 of design in the real world. Here I discuss “featuritis,”
the changes being forced upon us through the invention of new
technologies, and the distinction between incremental and radical
innovation. Everyone wants radical innovation, but the truth is,
most radical innovations fail, and even when they do succeed, it
can take multiple decades before they are accepted. Radical innovation, therefore, is relatively rare: incremental innovation is common.
The techniques of human-centered design are appropriate to incremental innovation: they cannot lead to radical innovations.
The chapter concludes with discussions of the trends to come,
the future of books, the moral obligations of design, and the rise of
small, do-it-yourself makers that are starting to revolutionize the
way ideas are conceived and introduced into the marketplace:
“the rise of the small,” I call it.


**Summary**


With the passage of time, the psychology of people stays the same,
but the tools and objects in the world change. Cultures change.


_Preface to the Revised Edition_ **xvii**


Technologies change. The principles of design still hold, but the
way they get applied needs to be modified to account for new activities, new technologies, new methods of communication and
interaction. _The Psychology of Everyday Things_ was appropriate for
the twentieth century: _The Design of Everyday Things_ is for the
twenty-first.

###### THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS


If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner,
my inability to perform well would neither surprise nor
bother me. But why should I have trouble with doors
and light switches, water faucets and stoves? “Doors?” I
can hear the reader saying. “You have trouble opening doors?” Yes.
I push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be
pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide.
Moreover, I see others having the same troubles—unnecessary
troubles. My problems with doors have become so well known
that confusing doors are often called “Norman doors.” Imagine
becoming famous for doors that don’t work right. I’m pretty sure
that’s not what my parents planned for me. (Put “Norman doors”
into your favorite search engine—be sure to include the quote
marks: it makes for fascinating reading.)
How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door
would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not
much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you
are in an office building, walking down a corridor. You come to a
door. How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or the
right? Maybe the door slides. If so, in which direction? I have seen
doors that slide to the left, to the right, and even up into the ceiling.

**FIGURE 1.1.** Coffeepot for Masochists. The
French artist Jacques Carelman in his series of
books _Catalogue d’objets introuvables_ (Catalog of
unfindable objects) provides delightful examples
of everyday things that are deliberately unworkable, outrageous, or otherwise ill-formed. One
of my favorite items is what he calls “coffeepot for
masochists.” The photograph shows a copy given
to me by collegues at the University of California,
San Diego. It is one of my treasured art objects.
(Photograph by Aymin Shamma for the author.)


The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any
need for signs, certainly without any need for trial and error.
A friend told me of the time he got trapped in the doorway of a
post office in a European city. The entrance was an imposing row
of six glass swinging doors, followed immediately by a second,
identical row. That’s a standard design: it helps reduce the airflow
and thus maintain the indoor temperature of the building. There
was no visible hardware: obviously the doors could swing in either direction: all a person had to do was push the side of the door
and enter.

My friend pushed on one of the outer doors. It swung inward,
and he entered the building. Then, before he could get to the next
row of doors, he was distracted and turned around for an instant.
He didn’t realize it at the time, but he had moved slightly to the
right. So when he came to the next door and pushed it, nothing
happened. “Hmm,” he thought, “must be locked.” So he pushed
the side of the adjacent door. Nothing. Puzzled, my friend decided
to go outside again. He turned around and pushed against the
side of a door. Nothing. He pushed the adjacent door. Nothing.
The door he had just entered no longer worked. He turned around
once more and tried the inside doors again. Nothing. Concern,
then mild panic. He was trapped! Just then, a group of people on
the other side of the entranceway (to my friend’s right) passed easily through both sets of doors. My friend hurried over to follow
their path.


**2** _The Design of Everyday Things_


How could such a thing happen? A swinging door has two sides.
One contains the supporting pillar and the hinge, the other is unsupported. To open the door, you must push or pull on the unsupported edge. If you push on the hinge side, nothing happens. In
my friend’s case, he was in a building where the designer aimed
for beauty, not utility. No distracting lines, no visible pillars, no visible hinges. So how can the ordinary user know which side to push
on? While distracted, my friend had moved toward the (invisible)
supporting pillar, so he was pushing the doors on the hinged side.
No wonder nothing happened. Attractive doors. Stylish. Probably
won a design prize.
Two of the most important characteristics of good design are _dis-_
_coverability_ and _understanding_ . Discoverability: Is it possible to even
figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the
product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls
and settings mean?
The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverability fails. Whether the device is a door or a stove, a mobile phone
or a nuclear power plant, the relevant components must be visible,
and they must communicate the correct message: What actions
are possible? Where and how should they be done? With doors
that push, the designer must provide signals that naturally indicate where to push. These need not destroy the aesthetics. Put a
vertical plate on the side to be pushed. Or make the supporting
pillars visible. The vertical plate and supporting pillars are natural
signals, naturally interpreted, making it easy to know just what to
do: no labels needed.

With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of manuals or personal instruction. We accept this
if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for
simple things. Many products defy understanding simply because
they have too many functions and controls. I don’t think that simple home appliances—stoves, washing machines, audio and television sets—should look like Hollywood’s idea of a spaceship
control room. They already do, much to our consternation. Faced


one: _The Psychopathology of Everyday Things_ **3**


with a bewildering array of controls and displays, we simply memorize one or two fixed settings to approximate what is desired.
In England I visited a home with a fancy new Italian washerdryer combination, with super-duper multisymbol controls, all to
do everything anyone could imagine doing with the washing and
drying of clothes. The husband (an engineering psychologist) said
he refused to go near it. The wife (a physician) said she had simply
memorized one setting and tried to ignore the rest. I asked to see
the manual: it was just as confusing as the device. The whole purpose of the design is lost.
