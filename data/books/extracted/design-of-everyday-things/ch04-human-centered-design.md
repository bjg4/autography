**Human-Centered Design**


People are frustrated with everyday things. From the ever-increasing
complexity of the automobile dashboard, to the increasing automation in the home with its internal networks, complex music,
video, and game systems for entertainment and communication,
and the increasing automation in the kitchen, everyday life sometimes seems like a never-ending fight against confusion, continued
errors, frustration, and a continual cycle of updating and maintaining our belongings.
In the multiple decades that have elapsed since the first edition
of this book was published, design has gotten better. There are now
many books and courses on the topic. But even though much has
improved, the rapid rate of technology change outpaces the advances in design. New technologies, new applications, and new
methods of interaction are continually arising and evolving. New
industries spring up. Each new development seems to repeat the
mistakes of the earlier ones; each new field requires time before
it, too, adopts the principles of good design. And each new invention of technology or interaction technique requires experimentation and study before the principles of good design can be fully
integrated into practice. So, yes, things are getting better, but as a
result, the challenges are ever present.
The solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach
that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. Good design starts with an understanding of psychology
and technology. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible,
what is happening, and what is about to happen. Communication is especially important when things go wrong. It is relatively
easy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously as

long as things go right. But as soon as there is a problem or a misunderstanding, the problems arise. This is where good design
is essential. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases
where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned.
Actually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when something goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then
the person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the
problem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration
of person and device feels wonderful.
Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the
design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are
encountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined
is one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the
HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is
done through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the
approach and the problem definition. The results can be products
that truly meet the needs of people. Doing HCD within the rigid
time, budget, and other constraints of industry can be a challenge:
Chapter 6 examines these issues.
Where does HCD fit into the earlier discussion of the several dif
ferent forms of design, especially the areas called industrial, interaction, and experience design? These are all compatible. HCD is a
philosophy and a set of procedures, whereas the others are areas of
focus (see Table 1.1). The philosophy and procedures of HCD add

deep consideration and study of human needs to the design process, whatever the product or service, whatever the major focus.
