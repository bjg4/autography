**The Moral Obligations of Design**


That design affects society is hardly news to designers. Many take
the implications of their work seriously. But the conscious manipulation of society has severe drawbacks, not the least of which is
the fact that not everyone agrees on the appropriate goals. Design,
therefore, takes on political significance; indeed, design philosophies vary in important ways across political systems. In Western
cultures, design has reflected the capitalistic importance of the marketplace, with an emphasis on exterior features deemed to be attractive to the purchaser. In the consumer economy, taste is not the
criterion in the marketing of expensive foods or drinks, usability is
not the primary criterion in the marketing of home and office appliances. We are surrounded with objects of desire, not objects of use.


**NEEDLESS FEATURES, NEEDLESS MODELS:**

**GOOD FOR BUSINESS, BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT**


In the world of consumable products, such as food and news, there
is always a need for more food and news. When the product is consumed, then the customers are consumers. A never-ending cycle. In
the world of services, the same applies. Someone has to cook and
serve the food in a restaurant, take care of us when we are sick, do
the daily transactions we all need. Services can be self-sustaining
because the need is always there.
But a business that makes and sells durable goods faces a problem: As soon as everyone who wants the product has it, then there
is no need for more. Sales will cease. The company will go out of
business.

In the 1920s, manufacturers deliberately planned ways of making
their products become obsolete (although the practice had existed


seven: _Design in the World of Business_ **291**


long before then). Products were built with a limited life span. Automobiles were designed to fall apart. A story tells of Henry Ford’s
buying scrapped Ford cars and having his engineers disassemble
them to see which parts failed and which were still in good shape.
Engineers assumed this was done to find the weak parts and make
them stronger. Nope. Ford explained that he wanted to find the
parts that were still in good shape. The company could save money
if they redesigned these parts to fail at the same time as the others.
Making things fail is not the only way to sustain sales. The women’s clothing industry is an example: what is fashionable this year is
not next year, so women are encouraged to replace their wardrobe
every season, every year. The same philosophy was soon extended
to the automobile industry, where dramatic style changes on a regular basis made it obvious which people were up to date; which
people were laggards, driving old-fashioned vehicles. The same is
true for our smart screens, cameras, and TV sets. Even the kitchen
and laundry, where appliances used to last for decades, have seen
the impact of fashion. Now, out-of-date features, out-of-date styling,
and even out-of-date colors entice homeowners to change. There
are some gender differences. Men are not as sensitive as women to
fashion in clothes, but they more than make up for the difference
by their interest in the latest fashions in automobiles and other
technologies.
But why purchase a new computer when the old one is functioning perfectly well? Why buy a new cooktop or refrigerator, a
new phone or camera? Do we really need the ice cube dispenser
in the door of the refrigerator, the display screen on the oven door,
the navigation system that uses three-dimensional images? What
is the cost to the environment for all the materials and energy used
to manufacture the new products, to say nothing of the problems
of disposing safely of the old?
Another model for sustainability is the subscription model. Do
you have an electronic reading device, or music or video player?
Subscribe to the service that provides articles and news, music and
entertainment, video and movies. These are all consumables, so


**292** _The Design of Everyday Things_


even though the smart screen is a fixed, durable good, the subscription guarantees a steady stream of money in return for services. Of course this only works if the manufacturer of the durable
good is also the provider of services. If not, what alternatives are
there?

Ah, the model year: each year a new model can be introduced,
just as good as the previous year’s model, only claiming to be better. It always increases in power and features. Look at all the new
features. How did you ever exist without them? Meanwhile, scientists, engineers, and inventors are busy developing yet newer
technologies. Do you like your television? What if it were in three
dimensions? With multiple channels of surround sound? With virtual goggles so you are surrounded by the images, 360 degrees’
worth? Turn your head or body and see what is happening behind
you. When you watch sports, you can be inside the team, experiencing the game the way the team does. Cars not only will drive
themselves to make you safer, but provide lots of entertainment
along the way. Video games will keep adding layers and chapters,
new story lines and characters, and of course, 3-D virtual environments. Household appliances will talk to one another, telling
remote households the secrets of our usage patterns.
The design of everyday things is in great danger of becoming the
design of superfluous, overloaded, unnecessary things.


**Design Thinking and**
**Thinking About Design**


Design is successful only if the final product is successful—if people buy it, use it, and enjoy it, thus spreading the word. A design
that people do not purchase is a failed design, no matter how great
the design team might consider it.
Designers need to make things that satisfy people’s needs, in
terms of function, in terms of being understandable and usable,
and in terms of their ability to deliver emotional satisfaction, pride,
and delight. In other words, the design must be thought of as a
total experience.


seven: _Design in the World of Business_ **293**


But successful products need more than a great design. They
have to be able to be produced reliably, efficiently, and on schedule. If the design complicates the engineering requirements so
much that they cannot be realized within the cost and scheduling
constraints, then the design is flawed. Similarly, if manufacturing
cannot produce the product, then the design is flawed.
Marketing considerations are important. Designers want to satisfy people’s needs. Marketing wants to ensure that people actually buy and use the product. These are two different sets of
requirements: design must satisfy both. It doesn’t matter how
great the design is if people don’t buy it. And it doesn’t matter
how many people buy something if they are going to dislike it
when they start using it. Designers will be more effective as they
learn more about sales and marketing, and the financial parts of
the business.

Finally, products have a complex life cycle. Many people will
need assistance in using a device, either because the design or the
manual is not clear, or because they are doing something novel that
was not considered in the product development, or for numerous
other reasons. If the service provided to these people is inadequate,
the product will suffer. Similarly if the device must be maintained,
repaired, or upgraded, how this is managed affects people’s appreciation of the product.
In today’s environmentally sensitive world, the full life cycle of
the product must be taken into consideration. What are the environmental costs of the materials, of the manufacturing process, of
distribution, servicing, and repairs? When it is time to replace the
unit, what is the environmental impact of recycling or otherwise
reusing the old?
The product development process is complex and difficult. But
to me, that is why it can be so rewarding. Great products pass
through a gauntlet of challenges. To satisfy the myriad needs requires skill as well as patience. It requires a combination of high
technical skills, great business skills, and a large amount of personal social skills for interacting with the many other groups that


**294** _The Design of Everyday Things_


are involved, all of whom have their own agendas, all of which
believe their requirements to be critical.
Design consists of a series of wonderful, exciting challenges,
with each challenge being an opportunity. Like all great drama,
it has its emotional highs and lows, peaks and valleys. The great
products overcome the lows and end up high.
Now you are on your own. If you are a designer, help fight the
battle for usability. If you are a user, then join your voice with those
who cry for usable products. Write to manufacturers. Boycott unusable designs. Support good designs by purchasing them, even
if it means going out of your way, even if it means spending a bit
more. And voice your concerns to the stores that carry the products; manufacturers listen to their customers.
When you visit museums of science and technology, ask questions if you have trouble understanding. Provide feedback about
the exhibits and whether they work well or poorly. Encourage museums to move toward better usability and understandability.
And enjoy yourself. Walk around the world examining the details of design. Learn how to observe. Take pride in the little things
that help: think kindly of the person who so thoughtfully put them
in. Realize that even details matter, that the designer may have
had to fight to include something helpful. If you have difficulties,
remember, it’s not your fault: it’s bad design. Give prizes to those
who practice good design: send flowers. Jeer those who don’t:
send weeds.

Technology continually changes. Much is for the good. Much
is not. All technology can be used in ways never intended by the
inventors. One exciting development is what I call “the rise of
the small.”


**THE RISE OF THE SMALL**


I dream of the power of individuals, whether alone or in small
groups, to unleash their creative spirits, their imagination, and
their talents to develop a wide range of innovation. New technologies promise to make this possible. Now, for the first time


seven: _Design in the World of Business_ **295**


in history, individuals can share their ideas, their thoughts and
dreams. They can produce their own products, their own services, and make these available to anyone in the world. All can
be their own master, exercising whatever special talents and interests they may have.
What drives this dream? The rise of small, efficient tools that
empower individuals. The list is large and growing continuously.
Consider the rise of musical explorations through conventional, electronic, and virtual instruments. Consider the rise of self-publishing,
bypassing conventional publishers, printers and distributors, and
replacing these with inexpensive electronic editions available to
anyone in the world to download to e-book readers.
Witness the rise of billions of small videos, available to all. Some
are simply self-serving, some are incredibly educational, and some
are humorous, some serious. They cover everything from how to
make spätzle to how to understand mathematics, or simply how
to dance or play a musical instrument. Some films are purely for
entertainment. Universities are getting into the act, sharing whole
curricula, including videos of lectures. College students post their
class assignments as videos and text, allowing the whole world to
benefit from their efforts. Consider the same phenomenon in writing, reporting events, and the creation of music and art.
Add to these capabilities the ready availability of inexpensive
motors, sensors, computation, and communication. Now consider
the potential when 3-D printers increase in performance while
decreasing in price, allowing individuals to manufacture custom
items whenever they are required. Designers all over the world
will publish their ideas and plans, enabling entire new industries
of custom mass production. Small quantities can be made as inexpensively as large, and individuals might design their own items
or rely on an ever-increasing number of freelance designers who
will publish plans that can then be customized and printed at local
3-D print shops or within their own homes.
Consider the rise of specialists to help plan meals and cook them,
to modify designs to fit needs and circumstances, to tutor on a


**296** _The Design of Everyday Things_


wide variety of topics. Experts share their knowledge on blogs and
on Wikipedia, all out of altruism, being rewarded by the thanks of
their readers.

I dream of a renaissance of talent, where people are empowered
to create, to use their skills and talents. Some may wish for the
safety and security of working for organizations. Some may wish
to start new enterprises. Some may do this as hobbies. Some may
band together into small groups and cooperatives, the better to assemble the variety of skills required by modern technology, to help
share their knowledge, to teach one another, and to assemble the
critical mass that will always be needed, even for small projects.
Some may hire themselves out to provide the necessary skills required of large projects, while still keeping their own freedom and
authority.
In the past, innovation happened in the industrialized nations
and with time, each innovation became more powerful, more complex, often bloated with features. Older technology was given to
the developing nations. The cost to the environment was seldom
considered. But with the rise of the small, with new, flexible, inexpensive technologies, the power is shifting. Today, anyone in the
world can create, design, and manufacture. The newly developed
nations are taking advantage, designing and building by themselves, for themselves. Moreover, out of necessity they develop
advanced devices that require less power, that are simpler to make,
maintain, and use. They develop medical procedures that don’t require refrigeration or continual access to electric power. Instead of
using handed-down technology, their results add value for all of
us—call it handed-up technology.
With the rise of global interconnection, global communication,
powerful design, and manufacturing methods that can be used
by all, the world is rapidly changing. Design is a powerful equalizing tool: all that is needed is observation, creativity, and hard
work—anyone can do it. With open-source software, inexpensive
open-source 3-D printers, and even open-source education, we can
transform the world.

**AS THE WORLD CHANGES,**

**WHAT STAYS THE SAME?**


With massive change, a number of fundamental principles stay
the same. Human beings have always been social beings. Social
interaction and the ability to keep in touch with people across the
world, across time, will stay with us. The design principles of this
book will not change, for the principles of discoverability, of feedback, and of the power of affordances and signifiers, mapping, and
conceptual models will always hold. Even fully autonomous, automatic machines will follow these principles for their interactions.
Our technologies may change, but the fundamental principles of
interaction are permanent.
