**The Future of Books**


It is one thing to have tools that aid in writing conventional books,
but quite another when we have tools that dramatically transform
the book.

Why should a book comprise words and some illustrations
meant to be read linearly from front to back? Why shouldn’t it be
composed of small sections, readable in whatever order is desired?
Why shouldn’t it be dynamic, with video and audio segments,
perhaps changing according to who is reading it, including notes
made by other readers or viewers, or incorporating the author’s
latest thoughts, perhaps changing even as it is being read, where
the word _text_ could mean anything: voice, video, images, diagrams, and words?
Some authors, especially of fiction, might still prefer the linear
telling of tales, for authors are storytellers, and in stories, the order in which characters and events are introduced is important to
build the suspense, keep the reader enthralled, and manage the
emotional highs and lows that characterize great storytelling. But


**288** _The Design of Everyday Things_


for nonfiction, for books like this one, order is not as important.
This book does not attempt to manipulate your emotions, to keep
you in suspense, or to have dramatic peaks. You should be able to
experience it in the order you prefer, reading items out of sequence
and skipping whatever is not relevant to your needs.
Suppose this book were interactive? If you have trouble understanding something, suppose you could click on the page and I
would pop up and explain something. I tried that many years ago
with three of my books, all combined into one interactive electronic
book. But the attempt fell prey to the demons of product design:
good ideas that appear too early will fail.
It took a lot of effort to produce that book. I worked with a large
team of people from Voyager Books, flying to Santa Monica, California, for roughly a year of visits to film the excerpts and record
my part. Robert Stein, the head of Voyager, assembled a talented
team of editors, producers, videographers, interactive designers,
and illustrators. Alas, the result was produced in a computer system called HyperCard, a clever tool developed by Apple but never
really given full support. Eventually, Apple stopped supporting it
and today, even though I still have copies of the original disks, they
will not run on any existing machine. (And even if they could, the
video resolution is very poor by today’s standards.)

Notice the phrase “it took a lot of effort to produce that book.”
I don’t even remember how many people were involved, but the
credits include the following: editor-producer, art director–graphic
designer, programmer, interface designers (four people, including
me), the production team (twenty-seven people), and then special
thanks to seventeen people.
Yes, today anybody can record a voice or video essay. Anyone
can shoot a video and do simple editing. But to produce a professional-level multimedia book of roughly three hundred pages
or two hours of video (or some combination) that will be read
and enjoyed by people across the world requires an immense
amount of talent and a variety of skills. Amateurs can do a fiveor ten-minute video, but anything beyond that requires superb
editing skills. Moreover, there has to be a writer, a cameraperson,
a recording person, and a lighting person. There has to be a director to coordinate these activities and to select the best approach to
each scene (chapter). A skilled editor is required to piece the segments together. An electronic book on the environment, Al Gore’s
interactive media book _Our Choice_ (2011), lists a large number of
job titles for the people responsible for this one book: publishers
(two people), editor, production director, production editor, and
production supervisor, software architect, user interface engineer,
engineer, interactive graphics, animations, graphics design, photo
editor, video editors (two), videographer, music, and cover designer. What is the future of the book? Very expensive.
The advent of new technologies is making books, interactive
media, and all sorts of educational and recreational material more
effective and pleasurable. Each of the many tools makes creation
easier. As a result, we will see a proliferation of materials. Most will
be amateurish, incomplete, and somewhat incoherent. But even
amateur productions can serve valuable functions in our lives, as
the immense proliferation of homemade videos available on the
Internet demonstrate, teaching us everything from how to cook
Korean _pajeon,_ repair a faucet, or understand Maxwell’s equations
of electromagnetic waves. But for high-quality professional material that tells a coherent story in a way that is reliable, where the


**290** _The Design of Everyday Things_


facts have been checked and the message authoritative, where the
material will flow, experts are needed. The mix of technologies
and tools makes quick and rough creation easier, but polished and
professional level material much more difficult. The society of the
future: something to look forward to with pleasure, contemplation,
and dread.
