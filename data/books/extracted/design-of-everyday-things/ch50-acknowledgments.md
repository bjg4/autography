###### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The original edition of this book was entitled _The Psychology of Ev-_
_eryday Things_ (POET). This title is a good example of the difference
between academics and industry. POET was a clever, cute title,
much loved by my academic friends. When Doubleday/Currency
approached me about publishing the paperback version of this
book, the editors also said, “But of course, the title will have to be
changed.” Title changed? I was horrified. But I decided to follow
my own advice and do some research on readers. I discovered that
while the academic community liked the title and its cleverness,
the business community did not. In fact, business often ignored the
book because the title sent the wrong message. Bookstores placed
the book in their psychology section (along with books on sex,
love, and self-help). The final nail in the title’s coffin came when I
was asked to talk to a group of senior executives of a leading manufacturing company. The person who introduced me to the audience praised the book, damned the title, and asked his colleagues
to read the book despite the title.

_**PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS**_


The book was conceived and the first few drafts written in the late

1980s while I was at the Applied Psychology Unit (the APU) in



**299**


Cambridge, England, a laboratory of the British Medical Research
Council (the laboratory no longer exists). At the APU, I met another visiting American professor, David Rubin of Duke University, who was analyzing the recall of epic poetry. Rubin showed
me that it wasn’t all in memory: much of the information was in
the world, or at least in the structure of the tale, the poetics, and the
lifestyles of the people.
After spending the fall and winter in Cambridge, England, at
the APU, I went to Austin, Texas, for the spring and summer (yes,
the opposite order from what would be predicted by thinking
of the weather at these two places). In Austin, I was at the Microelectronics and Computer Consortium (MCC), where I completed
the manuscript. Finally, when I returned to my home base at the
University of California, San Diego (UCSD), I revised the book several more times. I used it in classes and sent copies to a variety of
colleagues for suggestions. I benefited greatly from my interactions
at all these places: APU, MCC, and, of course, UCSD. The comments of my students and readers were invaluable, causing radical
revision from the original structure.
My hosts at the APU in Britain were most gracious, especially
Alan Baddeley, Phil Barnard, Thomas Green, Phil Johnson-Laird,
Tony Marcel, Karalyn and Roy Patterson, Tim Shallice, and Richard
Young. Peter Cook, Jonathan Grudin, and Dave Wroblewski were
extremely helpful during my stay at the MCC in Texas (another institution that no longer exists). At UCSD, I especially wish to thank
the students in Psychology 135 and 205: my undergraduate and
graduate courses at UCSD entitled “Cognitive Engineering.”
My understanding of how we interact with the world was developed and strengthened by years of debate and interaction with
a very powerful team of people at UCSD from the departments of
cognitive science, psychology, anthropology, and sociology, organized by Mike Cole, who met informally once a week for several
years. The primary members were Roy d’Andrade, Aaron Cicourel,
Mike Cole, Bud Mehan, George Mandler, Jean Mandler, Dave Rumelhart, and me. In later years, I benefited immensely from my

interactions with Jim Hollan, Edwin Hutchins, and David Kirsh, all
faculty members in the department of cognitive science at UCSD.
The early manuscript for POET was dramatically enhanced by
critical readings by my colleagues: In particular, I am indebted to
my editor at Basic Books, Judy Greissman, who provided patient
critique through several revisions of POET.
My colleagues in the design community were most helpful with
their comments: Mike King, Mihai Nadin, Dan Rosenberg, and Bill
Verplank. Special thanks must be given to Phil Agre, Sherman DeForest, and Jef Raskin, all of whom read the manuscript with care
and provided numerous and valuable suggestions. Collecting the
illustrations became part of the fun as I traveled the world with
camera in hand. Eileen Conway and Michael Norman helped collect and organize the figures and illustrations. Julie Norman helped
as she does on all my books, proofing, editing, commenting, and
encouraging. Eric Norman provided valuable advice, support, and
photogenic feet and hands.
Finally, my colleagues at the Institute for Cognitive Science at
UCSD helped throughout—in part through the wizardry of international computer mail, in part through their personal assistance
to the details of the process. I single out Bill Gaver, Mike Mozer,
and Dave Owen for their detailed comments, but many helped out
at one time or another during the research that preceded the book
and the several years of writing.

_**DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS,**_ **REVISED EDITION**


Because this new edition follows the organization and principles
of the first, all the help given to me for that earlier edition applies
to this one as well.

I have learned a lot in the years that have passed since the first
edition of this book. For one thing, then I was an academic scholar.
In the interim I have worked in several different companies. The
most important experience was at Apple, where I began to appreciate how issues—budget, schedule, competitive forces, and the


_Acknowledgments_ **301**


established base of products—that seldom concern scientists can
dominate decisions in the world of business. While I was at Apple
it had lost its way, but nothing is a better learning experience than
a company in trouble: you have to be a fast learner.
I learned about schedules and budgets, about the competing
demand of the different divisions, about the role of marketing,
industrial design, and graphical, usability, and interactive design
(today lumped together under the rubric of experience design). I
visited numerous companies across the United States, Europe, and
Asia and talked with numerous partners and customers. It was a
great learning experience. I am indebted to Dave Nagel, who hired
and then promoted me to vice president of advanced technology,
and to John Scully, the first CEO I worked with at Apple: John had
the correct vision of the future. I learned from many people, far
too many to name (a quick review of the Apple people I worked
closely with and who are still in my contact list reveals 240 names).
I learned about industrial design first from Bob Brunner, then
from Jonathan (Joni) Ive. (Joni and I had to fight together to convince Apple management to produce his ideas. My, how Apple
has changed!) Joy Mountford ran the design team in advanced
technology and Paulien Strijland ran the usability testing group
in the product division. Tom Erickson, Harry Saddler, and Austin Henderson worked for me in the User Experience Architect’s
office. Of particular significance to my increased understanding
were Larry Tesler, Ike Nassi, Doug Solomon, Michael Mace, Rick
LaFaivre, Guerrino De Luca, and Hugh Dubberly. Of special importance were the Apple Fellows Alan Kay, Guy Kawasaki, and
Gary Starkweather. (I was originally hired as an Apple Fellow.
All Fellows reported to the VP of advanced technology.) Steve
Wozniak, by a peculiar quirk, was an Apple employee with me as
his boss, which allowed me to spend a delightful afternoon with
him. I apologize to those of you who were so helpful, but who I
have not included here.

I thank my wife and critical reader, Julie Norman, for her patience in repeated careful readings of the manuscripts, telling me


**302** _Acknowledgments_


when I was stupid, redundant, and overly wordy. Eric Norman
showed up as a young child in two of the photos of the first edition, and now, twenty-five years later, read the entire manuscript
and provided cogent, valuable critiques. My assistant, Mimi Gardner, held off the e-mail onslaught, allowing me to concentrate upon
writing, and of course my friends at the Nielsen Norman group
provided inspiration. Thank you, Jakob.
Danny Bobrow of the Palo Alto Research Center, a frequent collaborator and coauthor of science papers for four decades, has
provided continual advice and cogent critiques of my ideas. Lera
Boroditsky shared her research on space and time with me, and
further delighted me by leaving Stanford to take a job at the department I had founded, Cognitive Science, at UCSD.
I am of course indebted to Professor Yutaka Sayeki of the University of Tokyo for permission to use his story of how he managed
the turn signals on his motorcycle. I used the story in the first edition, but disguised the name. A diligent Japanese reader figured
out who it must have been, so for this edition, I asked Sayeki for
permission to name him.
Professor Kun-Pyo Lee invited me to spend two months a year
for three years at the Korea Advanced Institute for Science and
Technology (KAIST) in its Industrial Design department, which
gave me a much deeper insight into the teaching of design, Korean
technology, and the culture of Northeast Asia, plus many new
friends and a permanent love for kimchi.
Alex Kotlov, watching over the entrance to the building on Market Street in San Francisco where I photographed the destination
control elevators, not only allowed me to photograph them, but
then turned out to have read DOET!

In the years since publication of POET/DOET, I have learned a
considerable amount about the practice of design. At IDEO I am
indebted to David Kelly and Tim Brown, as well as fellow IDEO
Fellows Barry Katz and Kristian Simsarian. I’ve had many fruitful
discussions with Ken Friedman, former dean of the faculty of design at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, as well as


_Acknowledgments_ **303**


with my colleagues at many of the major schools of design around
the world, in the United States, London, Delft, Eindhoven, Ivrea,
Milan, Copenhagen, and Hong Kong.
And thanks to Sandra Dijkstra, my literary agent for almost
thirty years, with POET being one of her first books, but who now
has a large team of people and successful authors. Thanks, Sandy.
Andrew Haskin and Kelly Fadem, at the time students at CCA,
the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, did all of the
drawings in the book—a vast improvement over the ones in the
first edition that I did myself.
Janaki (Mythily) Kumar, a User Experience designer at SAP, provided valuable comments on real world practices.
Thomas Kelleher (TJ), my editor at Basic Books for this revised
edition, provided rapid, efficient advice and editing suggestions
(which led me to yet another massive revision of the manuscript
that vastly improved the book). Doug Sery served as my editor at
MIT Press for the UK edition of this book (as well as for _Living with_
_Complexity_ ). For this book, TJ did all the work and Doug provided
encouragement.
