**Solving the Correct Problem**


Engineers and businesspeople are trained to solve problems. Designers are trained to discover the real problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all:
solve the correct problem.
Good designers never start by trying to solve the problem given
to them: they start by trying to understand what the real issues are.
As a result, rather than converge upon a solution, they diverge,
studying people and what they are trying to accomplish, generating idea after idea after idea. It drives managers crazy. Managers
want to see progress: designers seem to be going backward when
they are given a precise problem and instead of getting to work, they
ignore it and generate new issues to consider, new directions to
explore. And not just one, but many. What is going on?
The key emphasis of this book is the importance of developing
products that fit the needs and capabilities of people. Design can
be driven by many different concerns. Sometimes it is driven by
technology, sometimes by competitive pressures or by aesthetics.
Some designs explore the limits of technological possibilities; some
explore the range of imagination, of society, of art or fashion. Engineering design tends to emphasize reliability, cost, and efficiency.
The focus of this book, and of the discipline called human-centered
design, is to ensure that the result fits human desires, needs, and
capabilities. After all, why do we make products? We make them
for people to use.
Designers have developed a number of techniques to avoid being
captured by too facile a solution. They take the original problem

as a suggestion, not as a final statement, then think broadly about
what the issues underlying this problem statement might really be
(as was done through the “Five Whys” approach to getting at the
root cause, described in Chapter 5). Most important of all is that
the process be iterative and expansive. Designers resist the temptation to jump immediately to a solution for the stated problem.
Instead, they first spend time determining what basic, fundamental (root) issue needs to be addressed. They don’t try to search for
a solution until they have determined the real problem, and even
then, instead of solving that problem, they stop to consider a wide
range of potential solutions. Only then will they finally converge
upon their proposal. This process is called _design thinking._
Design thinking is not an exclusive property of designers—all
great innovators have practiced this, even if unknowingly, regardless of whether they were artists or poets, writers or scientists, engineers or businesspeople. But because designers pride
themselves on their ability to innovate, to find creative solutions to
fundamental problems, design thinking has become the hallmark
of the modern design firm. Two of the powerful tools of design
thinking are human-centered design and the double-diamond
diverge-converge model of design.
Human-centered design (HCD) is the process of ensuring that
people’s needs are met, that the resulting product is understandable and usable, that it accomplishes the desired tasks, and that the
experience of use is positive and enjoyable. Effective design needs
to satisfy a large number of constraints and concerns, including
shape and form, cost and efficiency, reliability and effectiveness,
understandability and usability, the pleasure of the appearance,
the pride of ownership, and the joy of actual use. HCD is a procedure for addressing these requirements, but with an emphasis on
two things: solving the right problem, and doing so in a way that
meets human needs and capabilities.
Over time, the many different people and industries that have
been involved in design have settled upon a common set of methods for doing HCD. Everyone has his or her own favorite method,

but all are variants on the common theme: iterate through the four
stages of observation, generation, prototyping, and testing. But
even before this, there is one overriding principle: solve the right
problem.
These two components of design—finding the right problem and
meeting human needs and capabilities—give rise to two phases of
the design process. The first phase is to find the right problem, the
second is to find the right solution. Both phases use the HCD process. This double-phase approach to design led the British Design
Council to describe it as a “double diamond.” So that is where we

start the story.
