**Memory in Multiple Heads, Multiple Devices**


If knowledge and structure in the world can combine with knowledge in the head to enhance memory performance, why not use
the knowledge in multiple heads, or in multiple devices?
Most of us have experienced the power of multiple minds in
remembering things. You are with a group of friends trying to remember the name of a movie, or perhaps a restaurant, and failing.
But others try to help. The conversation goes something like this:


“That new place where they grill meat”


“Oh, the Korean barbecue on Fifth Street?”


“No, not Korean, South American, um,“


“Oh, yeah, Brazilian, it’s what’s its name?”


“Yes, that’s the one!”


“Pampas something.”


“Yes, Pampas Chewy. Um, Churry, um,”


“Churrascaria. Pampas Churrascaria.”


How many people are involved? It could be any number, but the
point is that each adds their bit of knowledge, slowly constraining
the choices, recalling something that no single one of them could

have done alone. Daniel Wegner, a Harvard professor of psychology, has called this “transactive memory.”
Of course, we often turn to technological aids to answer our
questions, reaching for our smart devices to search our electronic
resources and the Internet. When we expand from seeking aids
from other people to seeking aids from our technologies, which
Wegner labels as “cybermind,” the principle is basically the same.
The cybermind doesn’t always produce the answer, but it can
produce sufficient clues so that we can generate the answer. Even
where the technology produces the answer, it is often buried in a
list of potential answers, so we have to use our own knowledge—
or the knowledge of our friends—to determine which of the potential items is the correct one.

What happens when we rely too much upon external knowledge,
be it knowledge in the world, knowledge of friends, or knowledge
provided by our technology? On the one hand, there no such thing
as “too much.” The more we learn to use these resources, the better our performance. External knowledge is a powerful tool for
enhanced intelligence. On the other hand, external knowledge is
often erroneous: witness the difficulties of trusting online sources
and the controversies that arise over Wikipedia entries. It doesn’t
matter where our knowledge comes from. What matters is the
quality of the end result.
In an earlier book, _Things That Make Us Smart,_ I argued that it
is this combination of technology and people that creates superpowerful beings. Technology does not make us smarter. People
do not make technology smart. It is the combination of the two,
the person plus the artifact, that is smart. Together, with our tools,
we are a powerful combination. On the other hand, if we are suddenly without these external devices, then we don’t do very well.
In many ways, we do become less smart.
Take away their calculator, and many people cannot do arithmetic. Take away a navigation system, and people can no longer
get around, even in their own cities. Take away a phone’s or computer’s address book, and people can no longer reach their friends
(in my case, I can no longer remember my own phone number).


**112** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Without a keyboard, I can’t write. Without a spelling corrector, I
can’t spell.
What does all of this mean? Is this bad or good? It is not a new
phenomenon. Take away our gas supply and electrical service and
we might starve. Take away our housing and clothes and we might
freeze. We rely on commercial stores, transportation, and government services to provide us with the essentials for living. Is
this bad?

The partnership of technology and people makes us smarter,
stronger, and better able to live in the modern world. We have
become reliant on the technology and we can no longer function
without it. The dependence is even stronger today than ever before,
including mechanical, physical things such as housing, clothing,
heating, food preparation and storage, and transportation. Now
this range of dependencies is extended to information services as
well: communication, news, entertainment, education, and social
interaction. When things work, we are informed, comfortable, and
effective. When things break, we may no longer be able to function.
This dependence upon technology is very old, but every decade,
the impact covers more and more activities.
