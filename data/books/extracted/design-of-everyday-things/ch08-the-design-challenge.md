**The Design Challenge**


Design requires the cooperative efforts of multiple disciplines. The
number of different disciplines required to produce a successful
product is staggering. Great design requires great designers, but
that isn’t enough: it also requires great management, because the

hardest part of producing a product is coordinating all the many,
separate disciplines, each with different goals and priorities. Each
discipline has a different perspective of the relative importance of
the many factors that make up a product. One discipline argues
that it must be usable and understandable, another that it must be
attractive, yet another that it has to be affordable. Moreover, the device has to be reliable, be able to be manufactured and serviced. It
must be distinguishable from competing products and superior in
critical dimensions such as price, reliability, appearance, and the
functions it provides. Finally, people have to actually purchase
it. It doesn’t matter how good a product is if, in the end, nobody

uses it.

Quite often each discipline believes its distinct contribution to
be most important: “Price,” argues the marketing representative,
“price plus these features.” “Reliable,” insist the engineers. “We
have to be able to manufacture it in our existing plants,” say the
manufacturing representatives. “We keep getting service calls,”
say the support people; “we need to solve those problems in the
design.” “You can’t put all that together and still have a reasonable
product,” says the design team. Who is right? Everyone is right.
The successful product has to satisfy all these requirements.
The hard part is to convince people to understand the viewpoints of the others, to abandon their disciplinary viewpoint and
to think of the design from the viewpoints of the person who buys
the product and those who use it, often different people. The viewpoint of the business is also important, because it does not matter
how wonderful the product is if not enough people buy it. If a
product does not sell, the company must often stop producing it,
even if it is a great product. Few companies can sustain the huge
cost of keeping an unprofitable product alive long enough for its
sales to reach profitability—with new products, this period is usually measured in years, and sometimes, as with the adoption of
high-definition television, decades.
Designing well is not easy. The manufacturer wants something
that can be produced economically. The store wants something
that will be attractive to its customers. The purchaser has several

demands. In the store, the purchaser focuses on price and appearance, and perhaps on prestige value. At home, the same person
will pay more attention to functionality and usability. The repair
service cares about maintainability: how easy is the device to take
apart, diagnose, and service? The needs of those concerned are
different and often conflict. Nonetheless, if the design team has
representatives from all the constituencies present at the same
time, it is often possible to reach satisfactory solutions for all
the needs. It is when the disciplines operate independently of one
another that major clashes and deficiencies occur. The challenge
is to use the principles of human-centered design to produce positive results, products that enhance lives and add to our pleasure
and enjoyment. The goal is to produce a great product, one that is
successful, and that customers love. It can be done.

###### THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY ACTIONS


_During my family’s stay in England, we rented a furnished house while_
_the owners were away. One day, our landlady returned to the house_
_to get some personal papers. She walked over to the old, metal filing_
_cabinet and attempted to open the top drawer. It wouldn’t open. She_
_pushed it forward and backward, right and left, up and down, without_
_success. I offered to help. I wiggled the drawer. Then I twisted the front_
_panel, pushed down hard, and banged the front with the palm of one_
_hand. The cabinet drawer slid open. “Oh,” she said, “I’m sorry. I am so_
_bad at mechanical things.” No, she had it backward. It is the mechanical_
_thing that should be apologizing, perhaps saying, “I’m sorry. I am so_
_bad with people.”_


My landlady had two problems. First, although she had
a clear goal (retrieve some personal papers) and even
a plan for achieving that goal (open the top drawer of
the filing cabinet, where those papers are kept), once
that plan failed, she had no idea of what to do. But she also had a
second problem: she thought the problem lay in her own lack of
ability: she blamed herself, falsely.
How was I able to help? First, I refused to accept the false accusation that it was the fault of the landlady: to me, it was clearly a
fault in the mechanics of the old filing cabinet that prevented the
drawer from opening. Second, I had a conceptual model of how
the cabinet worked, with an internal mechanism that held the door
shut in normal usage, and the belief that the drawer mechanism
was probably out of alignment. This conceptual model gave me
a plan: wiggle the drawer. That failed. That caused me to modify



**37**


my plan: wiggling may have been appropriate but not forceful
enough, so I resorted to brute force to try to twist the cabinet back
into its proper alignment. This felt good to me—the cabinet drawer
moved slightly—but it still didn’t open. So I resorted to the most
powerful tool employed by experts the world around—I banged
on the cabinet. And yes, it opened. In my mind, I decided (without
any evidence) that my hit had jarred the mechanism sufficiently to
allow the drawer to open.
This example highlights the themes of this chapter. First, how do
people do things? It is easy to learn a few basic steps to perform
operations with our technologies (and yes, even filing cabinets are
technology). But what happens when things go wrong? How do
we detect that they aren’t working, and then how do we know
what to do? To help understand this, I first delve into human psychology and a simple conceptual model of how people select and
then evaluate their actions. This leads the discussion to the role of

understanding (via a conceptual model) and of emotions: pleasure
when things work smoothly and frustration when our plans are
thwarted. Finally, I conclude with a summary of how the lessons
of this chapter translate into principles of design.


**How People Do Things:**
**The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation**


When people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Execution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the Gulf
of Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened (Figure 2.1). The role of the designer is to help people bridge the
two gulfs.
In the case of the filing cabinet, there were visible elements that
helped bridge the Gulf of Execution when everything was working perfectly. The drawer handle clearly signified that it should be
pulled and the slider on the handle indicated how to release the
catch that normally held the drawer in place. But when these operations failed, there then loomed a big gulf: what other operations
could be done to open the drawer?

The Gulf of Evaluation

was easily bridged, at first.
That is, the catch was re
leased, the drawer handle
pulled, yet nothing happened. The lack of action
signified a failure to reach
the goal. But when other
operations were tried, such
as my twisting and pulling, the filing cabinet provided no more information
about whether I was get- **FIGURE 2.1.** **uation.** When people encounter a device, they **The Gulfs of Execution and Eval-**

make to interpret the physical state of the device and to determine how well the expectations
and intentions have been met. The gulf is small when the device
provides information about its state in a form that is easy to get,
is easy to interpret, and matches the way the person thinks about
the system. What are the major design elements that help bridge the
Gulf of Evaluation? Feedback and a good conceptual model.
The gulfs are present for many devices. Interestingly, many people do experience difficulties, but explain them away by blaming
themselves. In the case of things they believe they should be capable of using—water faucets, refrigerator temperature controls, stove
tops—they simply think, “I’m being stupid.” Alternatively, for complicated-looking devices—sewing machines, washing machines,
digital watches, or almost any digital controls—they simply give up,
deciding that they are incapable of understanding them. Both explanations are wrong. These are the things of everyday household use.
None of them has a complex underlying structure. The difficulties
reside in their design, not in the people attempting to use them.


two: _The Psychology of Everyday Actions_ **39**


How can the designer help bridge the two gulfs? To answer that
question, we need to delve more deeply into the psychology of
human action. But the basic tools have already been discussed:
We bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of
Evaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model.
