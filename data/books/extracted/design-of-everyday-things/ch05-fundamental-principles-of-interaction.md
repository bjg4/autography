**Fundamental Principles of Interaction**


Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. _Experience_ : note
the word. Engineers tend not to like it; it is too subjective. But when
I ask them about their favorite automobile or test equipment, they
will smile delightedly as they discuss the fit and finish, the sensation of power during acceleration, their ease of control while shifting or steering, or the wonderful feel of the knobs and switches on
the instrument. Those are experiences.
Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions. Was the overall experience positive, or
was it frustrating and confusing? When our home technology behaves in an uninterpretable fashion we can become confused, frustrated, and even angry—all strong negative emotions. When there
is understanding it can lead to a feeling of control, of mastery, and
of satisfaction or even pride—all strong positive emotions. Cognition and emotion are tightly intertwined, which means that the
designers must design with both in mind.
When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to
work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and
what operations are possible: discoverability. Discoverability results from appropriate application of five fundamental psychological concepts covered in the next few chapters: _affordances, signifiers,_
_constraints, mappings_, and _feedback_ . But there is a sixth principle,
perhaps most important of all: the _conceptual model_ of the system.
It is the conceptual model that provides true understanding. So
I now turn to these fundamental principles, starting with affordances, signifiers, mappings, and feedback, then moving to conceptual models. Constraints are covered in Chapters 3 and 4.


**AFFORDANCES**


We live in a world filled with objects, many natural, the rest artificial. Every day we encounter thousands of objects, many of them
new to us. Many of the new objects are similar to ones we already


**10** _The Design of Everyday Things_


know, but many are unique, yet we manage quite well. How do we
do this? Why is it that when we encounter many unusual natural
objects, we know how to interact with them? Why is this true with
many of the artificial, human-made objects we encounter? The answer lies with a few basic principles. Some of the most important
of these principles come from a consideration of affordances.
The term _affordance_ refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent,
whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the
capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could
possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore,
affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single person (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong
person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people
cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have
that affordance, it does not afford lifting.
The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting.
This relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty
to many people. We are used to thinking that properties are associated with objects. But affordance is not a property. An affordance
is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the
properties of both the object and the agent.
Glass affords transparency. At the same time, its physical structure blocks the passage of most physical objects. As a result, glass
affords seeing through and support, but not the passage of air or
most physical objects (atomic particles can pass through glass).
The blockage of passage can be considered an anti-affordance—the
prevention of interaction. To be effective, affordances and antiaffordances have to be discoverable—perceivable. This poses a
difficulty with glass. The reason we like glass is its relative invisibility, but this aspect, so useful in the normal window, also hides
its anti-affordance property of blocking passage. As a result, birds
often try to fly through windows. And every year, numerous people injure themselves when they walk (or run) through closed glass


one: _The Psychopathology of Everyday Things_ **11**


doors or large picture windows. If an affordance or anti-affordance
cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: I call this property a _signifier_ (discussed in the next section).
The notion of affordance and the insights it provides originated
with J. J. Gibson, an eminent psychologist who provided many
advances to our understanding of human perception. I had interacted with him over many years, sometimes in formal conferences and seminars, but most fruitfully over many bottles of beer,
late at night, just talking. We disagreed about almost everything.
I was an engineer who became a cognitive psychologist, trying to
understand how the mind works. He started off as a Gestalt psychologist, but then developed an approach that is today named
after him: Gibsonian psychology, an ecological approach to perception. He argued that the world contained the clues and that people
simply picked them up through “direct perception.” I argued that
nothing could be direct: the brain had to process the information
arriving at the sense organs to put together a coherent interpretation. “Nonsense,” he loudly proclaimed; “it requires no interpretation: it is directly perceived.” And then he would put his hand to
his ears, and with a triumphant flourish, turn off his hearing aids:
my counterarguments would fall upon deaf ears—literally.
When I pondered my question—how do people know how to act
when confronted with a novel situation—I realized that a large
part of the answer lay in Gibson’s work. He pointed out that all the
senses work together, that we pick up information about the world
by the combined result of all of them. “Information pickup” was one
of his favorite phrases, and Gibson believed that the combined information picked up by all of our sensory apparatus—sight, sound,
smell, touch, balance, kinesthetic, acceleration, body position—
determines our perceptions without the need for internal processing or cognition. Although he and I disagreed about the role
played by the brain’s internal processing, his brilliance was in focusing attention on the rich amount of information present in the
world. Moreover, the physical objects conveyed important information about how people could interact with them, a property he
named “affordance.”


**12** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their
visibility is critical: visible affordances provide strong clues to the
operations of things. A flat plate mounted on a door affords pushing. Knobs afford turning, pushing, and pulling. Slots are for inserting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. Perceived
affordances help people figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions. I call the signaling component of affordances _signifiers._


**SIGNIFIERS**


Are affordances important to designers? The first edition of this
book introduced the term _affordances_ to the world of design. The
design community loved the concept and affordances soon propagated into the instruction and writing about design. I soon found
mention of the term everywhere. Alas, the term became used in
ways that had nothing to do with the original.
Many people find affordances difficult to understand because
they are relationships, not properties. Designers deal with fixed
properties, so there is a temptation to say that the property is an
affordance. But that is not the only problem with the concept of
affordances.

Designers have practical problems. They need to know how to
design things to make them understandable. They soon discovered that when working with the graphical designs for electronic
displays, they needed a way to designate which parts could be
touched, slid upward, downward, or sideways, or tapped upon.
The actions could be done with a mouse, stylus, or fingers. Some
systems responded to body motions, gestures, and spoken words,
with no touching of any physical device. How could designers describe what they were doing? There was no word that fit, so they
took the closest existing word— _affordance._ Soon designers were
saying such things as, “I put an affordance there,” to describe why
they displayed a circle on a screen to indicate where the person
should touch, whether by mouse or by finger. “No,” I said, “that is not
an affordance. That is a way of communicating where the touch
should be. You are communicating where to do the touching: the


one: _The Psychopathology of Everyday Things_ **13**


affordance of touching exists on the entire screen: you are trying to
signify _where_ the touch should take place. That’s not the same thing
as saying _what_ action is possible.”
Not only did my explanation fail to satisfy the design community, but I myself was unhappy. Eventually I gave up: designers
needed a word to describe what they were doing, so they chose
_affordance._ What alternative did they have? I decided to provide a
better answer: _signifiers_ . Affordances determine what actions are
possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
We need both.

People need some way of understanding the product or service
they wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening,
and what the alternative actions are. People search for clues, for
any sign that might help them cope and understand. It is the sign
that is important, anything that might signify meaningful information. Designers need to provide these clues. What people need, and
what designers must provide, are signifiers. Good design requires,
among other things, good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to the people who use it. That is
the role of the signifier.
The term _signifier_ has had a long and illustrious career in the exotic field of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols. But just as
I appropriated _affordance_ to use in design in a manner somewhat
different than its inventor had intended, I use _signifier_ in a somewhat different way than it is used in semiotics. For me, the term
_signifier_ refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that
communicates appropriate behavior to a person.
Signifiers can be deliberate and intentional, such as the sign
push on a door, but they may also be accidental and unintentional,
such as our use of the visible trail made by previous people walking through a field or over a snow-covered terrain to determine
the best path. Or how we might use the presence or absence of
people waiting at a train station to determine whether we have
missed the train. (I explain these ideas in more detail in my book
_Living with Complexity._ )

**A.**


**FIGURE 1.2.** **Problem Doors: Signifiers Are Needed.** Door hardware
can signal whether to push or pull without signs, but the hardware of the
two doors in the upper photo, A, are identical even though one should be
pushed, the other pulled. The flat, ribbed horizontal bar has the obvious
perceived affordance of pushing, but as the signs indicate, the door on the
left is to be pulled, the one on the right is to be pushed. In the bottom pair of
photos, B and C, there are no visible signifiers or affordances. How does one
know which side to push? Trial and error. When external signifiers—signs—
have to be added to something as simple as a door, it indicates bad design.
(Photographs by the author.)


The signifier is an important communication device to the recipient, whether or not communication was intended. It doesn’t matter
whether the useful signal was deliberately placed or whether it is
incidental: there is no necessary distinction. Why should it matter
whether a flag was placed as a deliberate clue to wind direction (as
is done at airports or on the masts of sailboats) or was there as an


one: _The Psychopathology of Everyday Things_ **15**


advertisement or symbol of pride in one’s country (as is done on
public buildings). Once I interpret a flag’s motion to indicate wind
direction, it does not matter why it was placed there.
Consider a bookmark, a deliberately placed signifier of one’s place
in reading a book. But the physical nature of books also makes a
bookmark an accidental signifier, for its placement also indicates
how much of the book remains. Most readers have learned to use

this accidental signifier to aid in their enjoyment of the reading.
With few pages left, we know the end is near. And if the reading is
torturous, as in a school assignment, one can always console oneself by knowing there are “only a few more pages to get through.”
Electronic book readers do not have the physical structure of paper
books, so unless the software designer deliberately provides a clue,
they do not convey any signal about the amount of text remaining.

**FIGURE 1.3.** **Sliding Doors: Seldom Done Well.** Sliding doors are seldom signified
properly. The top two photographs show the sliding door to the toilet on an Amtrak
train in the United States. The handle clearly signifies “pull,” but in fact, it needs to be
rotated and the door slid to the right. The owner of the store in Shanghai, China, Photo
C, solved the problem with a sign. “don’t push!” it says, in both English and Chinese.
Amtrak’s toilet door could have used a similar kind of sign. (Photographs by the author.)


**16** _The Design of Everyday Things_


Whatever their nature, planned or accidental, signifiers provide
valuable clues as to the nature of the world and of social activities.

For us to function in this social, technological world, we need to
develop internal models of what things mean, of how they operate.
We seek all the clues we can find to help in this enterprise, and
in this way, we are detectives, searching for whatever guidance
we might find. If we are fortunate, thoughtful designers provide
the clues for us. Otherwise, we must use our own creativity and
imagination.


**FIGURE 1.4.** **The Sink That Would Not Drain:** **Where Signifiers Fail.** I washed my
hands in my hotel sink in London, but then, as shown in Photo A, was left with the
question of how to empty the sink of the dirty water. I searched all over for a control:
none. I tried prying open the sink stopper with a spoon (Photo B): failure. I finally left
my hotel room and went to the front desk to ask for instructions. (Yes, I actually did.)
“Push down on the stopper,” I was told. Yes, it worked (Photos C and D). But how was
anyone to ever discover this? And why should I have to put my clean hands back into
the dirty water to empty the sink? The problem here is not just the lack of signifier, it is
the faulty decision to produce a stopper that requires people to dirty their clean hands
to use it. (Photographs by the author.)

Affordances, perceived affordances, and signifiers have much in
common, so let me pause to ensure that the distinctions are clear.
Affordances represent the possibilities in the world for how an
agent (a person, animal, or machine) can interact with something.
Some affordances are perceivable, others are invisible. Signifiers
are signals. Some signifiers are signs, labels, and drawings placed
in the world, such as the signs labeled “push,” “pull,” or “exit”
on doors, or arrows and diagrams indicating what is to be acted
upon or in which direction to gesture, or other instructions. Some
signifiers are simply the perceived affordances, such as the handle of a door or the physical structure of a switch. Note that some
perceived affordances may not be real: they may look like doors
or places to push, or an impediment to entry, when in fact they
are not. These are misleading signifiers, oftentimes accidental but
sometimes purposeful, as when trying to keep people from doing
actions for which they are not qualified, or in games, where one of
the challenges is to figure out what is real and what is not.



**FIGURE 1.5.** **Accidental Affordances**
**Can Become Strong Signifiers.** This
wall, at the Industrial Design department
of KAIST, in Korea, provides an antiaffordance, preventing people from falling
down the stair shaft. Its top is flat, an accidental by-product of the design. But flat
surfaces afford support, and as soon as one
person discovers it can be used to dispose
of empty drink containers, the discarded
container becomes a signifier, telling others
that it is permissible to discard their items
there. (Photographs by the author.)

**18** _The Design of Everyday Things_


My favorite example of a misleading signifier is a row of vertical pipes across a service road that I once saw in a public park.
The pipes obviously blocked cars and trucks from driving on that
road: they were good examples of anti-affordances. But to my great
surprise, I saw a park vehicle simply go through the pipes. Huh? I
walked over and examined them: the pipes were made of rubber,
so vehicles could simply drive right over them. A very clever signifier, signaling a blocked road (via an apparent anti-affordance)
to the average person, but permitting passage for those who knew.

To summarize:


 - Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.

 - Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.

 - Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and
how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they

fail to function.


In design, signifiers are more important than affordances, for
they communicate how to use the design. A signifier can be words,
a graphical illustration, or just a device whose perceived affordances are unambiguous. Creative designers incorporate the signifying part of the design into a cohesive experience. For the most
part, designers can focus upon signifiers.
Because affordances and signifiers are fundamentally important
principles of good design, they show up frequently in the pages of
this book. Whenever you see hand-lettered signs pasted on doors,
switches, or products, trying to explain how to work them, what to
do and what not to do, you are also looking at poor design.

**MAPPING**





Mapping is a technical term, borrowed from mathematics, meaning the relationship between the elements of two sets of things.
Suppose there are many lights in the ceiling of a classroom or auditorium and a row of light switches on the wall at the front of the


**20** _The Design of Everyday Things_


**FIGURE 1.6.** **Signifiers on a Touch Screen.**
The arrows and icons are signifiers: they provide signals about the permissible operations
for this restaurant guide. Swiping left or right
brings up new restaurant recommendations.
Swiping up reveals the menu for the restaurant being displayed; swiping down, friends
who recommend the restaurant.


room. The mapping of switches to lights specifies which switch
controls which light.
Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of
controls and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being
controlled, it is easy to determine how to use them. In steering a
car, we rotate the steering wheel clockwise to cause the car to turn
right: the top of the wheel moves in the same direction as the car.
Note that other choices could have been made. In early cars, steering was controlled by a variety of devices, including tillers, handlebars, and reins. Today, some vehicles use joysticks, much as in a
computer game. In cars that used tillers, steering was done much
as one steers a boat: move the tiller to the left to turn to the right.
Tractors, construction equipment such as bulldozers and cranes,
and military tanks that have tracks instead of wheels use separate
controls for the speed and direction of each track: to turn right, the
left track is increased in speed, while the right track is slowed or
even reversed. This is also how a wheelchair is steered.

All of these mappings for the control of vehicles work because
each has a compelling conceptual model of how the operation of
the control affects the vehicle. Thus, if we speed up the left wheel
of a wheelchair while stopping the right wheel, it is easy to imagine the chair’s pivoting on the right wheel, circling to the right. In


one: _The Psychopathology of Everyday Things_ **21**


a small boat, we can understand the tiller by realizing that pushing
the tiller to the left causes the ship’s rudder to move to the right
and the resulting force of the water on the rudder slows down the
right side of the boat, so that the boat rotates to the right. It doesn’t
matter whether these conceptual models are accurate: what matters is that they provide a clear way of remembering and understanding the mappings. The relationship between a control and
its results is easiest to learn wherever there is an understandable

mapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result.
Natural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial
analogies, leads to immediate understanding. For example, to move
an object up, move the control up. To make it easy to determine
which control works which light in a large room or auditorium,
arrange the controls in the same pattern as the lights. Some natural
mappings are cultural or biological, as in the universal standard
that moving the hand up signifies more, moving it down signifies
less, which is why it is appropriate to use vertical position to represent intensity or amount. Other natural mappings follow from
the principles of perception and allow for the natural grouping or
patterning of controls and feedback. Groupings and proximity
are important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used
to map controls to function: related controls should be grouped together. Controls should be close to the item being controlled.
Note that there are many mappings that feel “natural” but in fact
are specific to a particular culture: what is natural for one culture
is not necessarily natural for another. In Chapter 3, I discuss how


**FIGURE 1.7.** **Good Mapping: Automobile Seat**
**Adjustment Control.** This is an excellent example of
natural mapping. The control is in the shape of the
seat itself: the mapping is straightforward. To move
the front edge of the seat higher, lift up on the front
part of the button. To make the seat back recline,
move the button back. The same principle could be
applied to much more common objects. This particular control is from Mercedes-Benz, but this form of
mapping is now used by many automobile companies. (Photograph by the author.)


**22** _The Design of Everyday Things_


different cultures view time, which has important implications for
some kinds of mappings.
A device is easy to use when the set of possible actions is visible, when the controls and displays exploit natural mappings. The
principles are simple but rarely incorporated into design. Good design takes care, planning, thought, and an understanding of how
people behave.


**FEEDBACK**


Ever watch people at an elevator repeatedly push the Up button,
or repeatedly push the pedestrian button at a street crossing? Ever
drive to a traffic intersection and wait an inordinate amount of

time for the signals to change, wondering all the time whether the
detection circuits noticed your vehicle (a common problem with
bicycles)? What is missing in all these cases is feedback: some way
of letting you know that the system is working on your request.
Feedback—communicating the results of an action—is a wellknown concept from the science of control and information theory.
Imagine trying to hit a target with a ball when you cannot see the
target. Even as simple a task as picking up a glass with the hand requires feedback to aim the hand properly, to grasp the glass, and to
lift it. A misplaced hand will spill the contents, too hard a grip will
break the glass, and too weak a grip will allow it to fall. The human
nervous system is equipped with numerous feedback mechanisms,
including visual, auditory, and touch sensors, as well as vestibular
and proprioceptive systems that monitor body position and muscle and limb movements. Given the importance of feedback, it is
amazing how many products ignore it.
Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second
can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up,
going off to do other activities. This is annoying to the people, but
it can also be wasteful of resources when the system spends considerable time and effort to satisfy the request, only to find that the
intended recipient is no longer there. Feedback must also be informative. Many companies try to save money by using inexpensive
lights or sound generators for feedback. These simple light flashes


one: _The Psychopathology of Everyday Things_ **23**


or beeps are usually more annoying than useful. They tell us that
something has happened, but convey very little information about
what has happened, and then nothing about what we should do
about it. When the signal is auditory, in many cases we cannot
even be certain which device has created the sound. If the signal
is a light, we may miss it unless our eyes are on the correct spot
at the correct time. Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback

at all, because it is distracting, uninformative, and in many cases
irritating and anxiety-provoking.
Too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little.
My dishwasher likes to beep at three a.m. to tell me that the wash
is done, defeating my goal of having it work in the middle of the
night so as not to disturb anyone (and to use less expensive electricity). But worst of all is inappropriate, uninterpretable feedback.
The irritation caused by a “backseat driver” is well enough known
that it is the staple of numerous jokes. Backseat drivers are often
correct, but their remarks and comments can be so numerous and
continuous that instead of helping, they become an irritating distraction. Machines that give too much feedback are like backseat
drivers. Not only is it distracting to be subjected to continual flashing lights, text announcements, spoken voices, or beeps and boops,
but it can be dangerous. Too many announcements cause people to
ignore all of them, or wherever possible, disable all of them, which
means that critical and important ones are apt to be missed. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things,
including a calm and relaxing environment.
Poor design of feedback can be the result of decisions aimed at
reducing costs, even if they make life more difficult for people.
Rather than use multiple signal lights, informative displays, or
rich, musical sounds with varying patterns, the focus upon cost
reduction forces the design to use a single light or sound to convey
multiple types of information. If the choice is to use a light, then
one flash might mean one thing; two rapid flashes, something else.
A long flash might signal yet another state; and a long flash followed by a brief one, yet another. If the choice is to use a sound,
quite often the least expensive sound device is selected, one that


**24** _The Design of Everyday Things_


can only produce a high-frequency beep. Just as with the lights,
the only way to signal different states of the machine is by beeping
different patterns. What do all these different patterns mean? How
can we possibly learn and remember them? It doesn’t help that
every different machine uses a different pattern of lights or beeps,
sometimes with the same patterns meaning contradictory things
for different machines. All the beeps sound alike, so it often isn’t
even possible to know which machine is talking to us.
Feedback has to be planned. All actions need to be confirmed,
but in a manner that is unobtrusive. Feedback must also be prioritized, so that unimportant information is presented in an unobtrusive fashion, but important signals are presented in a way that
does capture attention. When there are major emergencies, then
even important signals have to be prioritized. When every device
is signaling a major emergency, nothing is gained by the resulting cacophony. The continual beeps and alarms of equipment can
be dangerous. In many emergencies, workers have to spend valuable time turning off all the alarms because the sounds interfere
with the concentration required to solve the problem. Hospital operating rooms, emergency wards. Nuclear power control plants.
Airplane cockpits. All can become confusing, irritating, and lifeendangering places because of excessive feedback, excessive alarms,
and incompatible message coding. Feedback is essential, but it has
to be done correctly. Appropriately.


**CONCEPTUAL MODELS**


A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified,
of how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even
accurate as long as it is useful. The files, folders, and icons you see
displayed on a computer screen help people create the conceptual
model of documents and folders inside the computer, or of apps
or applications residing on the screen, waiting to be summoned. In
fact, there are no folders inside the computer—those are effective
conceptualizations designed to make them easier to use. Sometimes these depictions can add to the confusion, however. When
reading e-mail or visiting a website, the material appears to be on


one: _The Psychopathology of Everyday Things_ **25**


the device, for that is where it is displayed and manipulated. But
in fact, in many cases the actual material is “in the cloud,” located
on some distant machine. The conceptual model is of one, coherent
image, whereas it may actually consist of parts, each located on
different machines that could be almost anywhere in the world.
This simplified model is helpful for normal usage, but if the network connection to the cloud services is interrupted, the result can
be confusing. Information is still on their screen, but users can no
longer save it or retrieve new things: their conceptual model offers
no explanation. Simplified models are valuable only as long as the
assumptions that support them hold true.
There are often multiple conceptual models of a product or device. People’s conceptual models for the way that regenerative
braking in a hybrid or electrically powered automobile works are
quite different for average drivers than for technically sophisticated drivers, different again for whoever must service the system,
and yet different again for those who designed the system.
Conceptual models found in technical manuals and books for
technical use can be detailed and complex. The ones we are concerned with here are simpler: they reside in the minds of the people who are using the product, so they are also “mental models.”
Mental models, as the name implies, are the conceptual models in
people’s minds that represent their understanding of how things
work. Different people may hold different mental models of the
same item. Indeed, a single person might have multiple models of
the same item, each dealing with a different aspect of its operation: the models can even be in conflict.

Conceptual models are often inferred from the device itself. Some
models are passed on from person to person. Some come from
manuals. Usually the device itself offers very little assistance, so
the model is constructed by experience. Quite often these models
are erroneous, and therefore lead to difficulties in using the device.
The major clues to how things work come from their perceived
structure—in particular from signifiers, affordances, constraints,
and mappings. Hand tools for the shop, gardening, and the house
tend to make their critical parts sufficiently visible that concep

tual models of their operation and function are readily derived.
Consider a pair of scissors: you can see that the number of possible actions is limited. The holes are clearly there to put something
into, and the only logical things that will fit are fingers. The holes
are both affordances—they allow the fingers to be inserted—and
signifiers—they indicate where the fingers are to go. The sizes of
the holes provide constraints to limit the possible fingers: a big
hole suggests several fingers; a small hole, only one. The mapping
between holes and fingers—the set of possible operations—is signified and constrained by the holes. Moreover, the operation is not
sensitive to finger placement: if you use the wrong fingers (or the
wrong hand), the scissors still work, although not as comfortably.
You can figure out the scissors because their operating parts are
visible and the implications clear. The conceptual model is obvious,
and there is effective use of signifiers, affordances, and constraints.
What happens when the device does not suggest a good conceptual model? Consider my digital watch with five buttons: two along
the top, two along the bottom, and one on the left side (Figure 1.8).
What is each button for? How would you set the time? There is no
way to tell—no evident relationship between the operating controls
and the functions, no constraints, no apparent mappings. Moreover,
the buttons have multiple ways of being used. Two of the buttons
do different things when pushed quickly or when kept depressed
for several seconds. Some operations require simultaneous depression of several of the buttons. The only way to tell how to work the
watch is to read the manual, over and over again. With the scissors,
moving the handle makes the blades move. The watch provides no

visible relationship between the buttons and the possible actions,
no discernible relationship between the actions and the end results.
I really like the watch: too bad I can’t remember all the functions.
Conceptual models are valuable in providing understanding, in
predicting how things will behave, and in figuring out what to do
when things do not go as planned. A good conceptual model allows
us to predict the effects of our actions. Without a good model, we operate by rote, blindly; we do operations as we were told to do them;
we can’t fully appreciate why, what effects to expect, or what to do
if things go wrong. As long as things work properly, we can manage.
When things go wrong, however, or when we come upon a novel
situation, then we need a deeper understanding, a good model.
For everyday things, conceptual models need not be very complex. After all, scissors, pens, and light switches are pretty simple
devices. There is no need to understand the underlying physics or
chemistry of each device we own, just the relationship between
the controls and the outcomes. When the model presented to us is
inadequate or wrong (or, worse, nonexistent), we can have difficulties. Let me tell you about my refrigerator.
I used to own an ordinary, two-compartment refrigerator—nothing
very fancy about it. The problem was that I couldn’t set the temperature properly. There were only two things to do: adjust the
temperature of the freezer compartment and adjust the tempera

fresh food and freezer—and two controls (in the fresh food
unit). Your task: Suppose the freezer is too cold, the fresh food

ture of the fresh food compartment. And there were two controls,
one labeled “freezer,” the other “refrigerator.” What’s the problem?
Oh, perhaps I’d better warn you. The two controls are not independent. The freezer control also affects the fresh food temperature, and the fresh food control also affects the freezer. Moreover,
the manual warns that one should “always allow twenty-four (24)
hours for the temperature to stabilize whether setting the controls
for the first time or making an adjustment.”
It was extremely difficult to regulate the temperature of my old
refrigerator. Why? Because the controls suggest a false conceptual
model. Two compartments, two controls, which implies that each
control is responsible for the temperature of the compartment that
carries its name: this conceptual model is shown in Figure 1.10A. It
is wrong. In fact, there is only one thermostat and only one cooling
mechanism. One control adjusts the thermostat setting, the other
the relative proportion of cold air sent to each of the two compartments of the refrigerator. This is why the two controls interact: this
conceptual model is shown in Figure 1.10B. In addition, there must
be a temperature sensor, but there is no way of knowing where it
is located. With the conceptual model suggested by the controls,


**FIGURE 1.10.** **Two Conceptual Models for a Refrigerator.** The conceptual model
A is provided by the system image of the refrigerator as gleaned from the controls.
Each control determines the temperature of the named part of the refrigerator. This
means that each compartment has its own temperature sensor and cooling unit. This is
wrong. The correct conceptual model is shown in B. There is no way of knowing where
the temperature sensor is located so it is shown outside the refrigerator. The freezer
control determines the freezer temperature (so is this where the sensor is located?).
The refrigerator control determines how much of the cold air goes to the freezer and
how much to the refrigerator.

adjusting the temperatures is almost impossible and always frustrating. Given the correct model, life would be much easier.
Why did the manufacturer suggest the wrong conceptual model?
We will never know. In the twenty-five years since the publication
of the first edition of this book, I have had many letters from people
thanking me for explaining their confusing refrigerator, but never
any communication from the manufacturer (General Electric). Perhaps the designers thought the correct model was too complex,
that the model they were giving was easier to understand. But with
the wrong conceptual model, it was impossible to set the controls.
And even though I am convinced I knew the correct model, I still
couldn’t accurately adjust the temperatures because the refrigerator design made it impossible to discover which control was for the
temperature sensor, which for the relative proportion of cold air,
and in which compartment the sensor was located. The lack of immediate feedback for the actions did not help: it took twenty-four
hours to see whether the new setting was appropriate. I shouldn’t
have to keep a laboratory notebook and do controlled experiments
just to set the temperature of my refrigerator.
I am happy to say that I no longer own that refrigerator. Instead I have one that has two separate controls, one in the fresh
food compartment, one in the freezer compartment. Each control
is nicely calibrated in degrees and labeled with the name of the
compartment it controls. The two compartments are independent:
setting the temperature in one has no effect on the temperature in
the other. This solution, although ideal, does cost more. But far less
expensive solutions are possible. With today’s inexpensive sensors
and motors, it should be possible to have a single cooling unit with
a motor-controlled valve controlling the relative proportion of cold
air diverted to each compartment. A simple, inexpensive computer
chip could regulate the cooling unit and valve position so that the
temperatures in the two compartments match their targets. A bit
more work for the engineering design team? Yes, but the results
would be worth it. Alas, General Electric is still selling refrigerators
with the very same controls and mechanisms that cause so much

confusion. The photograph in Figure 1.9 is from a contemporary
refrigerator, photographed in a store while preparing this book.
