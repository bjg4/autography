**Deliberate Violations**


Errors are not the only type of human failures. Sometimes people knowingly take risks. When the outcome is positive, they are
often rewarded. When the result is negative, they might be punished. But how do we classify these deliberate violations of known,
proper behavior? In the error literature, they tend to be ignored. In
the accident literature, they are an important component.
Deliberate deviations play an important role in many accidents.
They are defined as cases where people intentionally violate procedures and regulations. Why do they happen? Well, almost every
one of us has probably deliberately violated laws, rules, or even
our own best judgment at times. Ever go faster than the speed
limit? Drive too fast in the snow or rain? Agree to do some hazardous act, even while privately thinking it foolhardy to do so?
In many industries, the rules are written more with a goal toward
legal compliance than with an understanding of the work requirements. As a result, if workers followed the rules, they couldn’t get
their jobs done. Do you sometimes prop open locked doors? Drive
with too little sleep? Work with co-workers even though you are ill
(and might therefore be infectious)?
Routine violations occur when noncompliance is so frequent that
it is ignored. Situational violations occur when there are special circumstances (example: going through a red light “because no other
cars were visible and I was late”). In some cases, the only way to
complete a job might be to violate a rule or procedure.
A major cause of violations is inappropriate rules or procedures
that not only invite violation but encourage it. Without the violations, the work could not be done. Worse, when employees feel it
necessary to violate the rules in order to get the job done and, as a
result, succeed, they will probably be congratulated and rewarded.
This, of course, unwittingly rewards noncompliance. Cultures that
encourage and commend violations set poor role models.


five: _Human Error? No, Bad Design_ **169**


Although violations are a form of error, these are organizational
and societal errors, important but outside the scope of the design of
everyday things. The human error examined here is unintentional:
deliberate violations, by definition, are intentional deviations that
are known to be risky, with the potential of doing harm.
