**Blaming the Wrong Things**


People try to find causes for events. They tend to assign a causal relation whenever two things occur in succession. If some unexpected
event happens in my home just after I have taken some action, I am
apt to conclude that it was caused by that action, even if there really
was no relationship between the two. Similarly, if I do something expecting a result and nothing happens, I am apt to interpret this lack
of informative feedback as an indication that I didn’t do the action

correctly: the most likely thing to do, therefore, is to repeat the action,
only with more force. Push a door and it fails to open? Push again,
harder. With electronic devices, if the feedback is delayed sufficiently,
people often are led to conclude that the press wasn’t recorded, so
they do the same action again, sometimes repeatedly, unaware that
all of their presses were recorded. This can lead to unintended results.
Repeated presses might intensify the response much more than was
intended. Alternatively, a second request might cancel the previous
one, so that an odd number of pushes produces the desired result,
whereas an even number leads to no result.

The tendency to repeat an action when the first attempt fails
can be disastrous. This has led to numerous deaths when people

tried to escape a burning building by attempting to push open exit
doors that opened inward, doors that should have been pulled. As
a result, in many countries, the law requires doors in public places
to open outward, and moreover to be operated by so-called panic
bars, so that they automatically open when people, in a panic to
escape a fire, push their bodies against them. This is a great application of appropriate affordances: see the door in Figure 2.5.
Modern systems try hard to provide feedback within 0.1 second
of any operation, to reassure the user that the request was received.
This is especially important if the operation will take considerable
time. The presence of a filling hourglass or rotating clock hands is
a reassuring sign that work is in progress. When the delay can be
predicted, some systems provide time estimates as well as progress
bars to indicate how far along the task has gone. More systems
should adopt these sensible displays to provide timely and meaningful feedback of results.
Some studies show it is wise to underpredict—that is, to say an
operation will take longer than it actually will. When the system
computes the amount of time, it can compute the range of possible


**FIGURE 2.5.** **Panic Bars on Doors.** People fleeing a fire would die if they encountered exit doors that opened inward, because they would keep trying to push
them outward, and when that failed, they would push harder. The proper design,
now required by law in many places, is to change the design of doors so that they
open when pushed. Here is one example: an excellent design strategy for dealing
with real behavior by the use of the proper affordances coupled with a graceful
signifier, the black bar, which indicates where to push. (Photograph by author at the

times. In that case it ought to display the range, or if only a single
value is desirable, show the slowest, longest value. That way, the
expectations are liable to be exceeded, leading to a happy result.
When it is difficult to determine the cause of a difficulty, where
do people put the blame? Often people will use their own conceptual models of the world to determine the perceived causal relationship between the thing being blamed and the result. The word
_perceived_ is critical: the causal relationship does not have to exist;
the person simply has to think it is there. Sometimes the result is
to attribute cause to things that had nothing to do with the action.
Suppose I try to use an everyday thing, but I can’t. Who is at
fault: me or the thing? We are apt to blame ourselves, especially if
others are able to use it. Suppose the fault really lies in the device,
so that lots of people have the same problems. Because everyone
perceives the fault to be his or her own, nobody wants to admit
to having trouble. This creates a conspiracy of silence, where the
feelings of guilt and helplessness among people are kept hidden.
Interestingly enough, the common tendency to blame ourselves
for failures with everyday objects goes against the normal attributions we make about ourselves and others. Everyone sometimes
acts in a way that seems strange, bizarre, or simply wrong and
inappropriate. When we do this, we tend to attribute our behavior
to the environment. When we see others do it, we tend to attribute
it to their personalities.
Here is a made-up example. Consider Tom, the office terror. Today, Tom got to work late, yelled at his colleagues because the office coffee machine was empty, then ran to his office and slammed
the door shut. “Ah,” his colleagues and staff say to one another,
“there he goes again.”
Now consider Tom’s point of view. “I really had a hard day,” Tom
explains. “I woke up late because my alarm clock failed to go off: I
didn’t even have time for my morning coffee. Then I couldn’t find
a parking spot because I was late. And there wasn’t any coffee in
the office machine; it was all out. None of this was my fault—I had
a run of really bad events. Yes, I was a bit curt, but who wouldn’t
be under the same circumstances?”


two: _The Psychology of Everyday Actions_ **61**


Tom’s colleagues don’t have access to his inner thoughts or to his
morning’s activities. All they see is that Tom yelled at them simply
because the office coffee machine was empty. This reminds them of
another similar event. “He does that all the time,” they conclude,
“always blowing up over the most minor things.” Who is correct?
Tom or his colleagues? The events can be seen from two different points of view with two different interpretations: common responses to the trials of life or the result of an explosive, irascible
personality.
It seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on
the environment. It seems equally natural to blame other people’s
misfortunes on their personalities. Just the opposite attribution, by
the way, is made when things go well. When things go right, people credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do
the reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they
sometimes credit the environment, or luck.
In all such cases, whether a person is inappropriately accepting
blame for the inability to work simple objects or attributing behavior to environment or personality, a faulty conceptual model is
at work.


**LEARNED HELPLESSNESS**


The phenomenon called _learned helplessness_ might help explain the
self-blame. It refers to the situation in which people experience repeated failure at a task. As a result, they decide that the task cannot
be done, at least not by them: they are helpless. They stop trying.
If this feeling covers a group of tasks, the result can be severe difficulties coping with life. In the extreme case, such learned helplessness leads to depression and to a belief that the individuals cannot
cope with everyday life at all. Sometimes all it takes to get such a
feeling of helplessness are a few experiences that accidentally turn
out bad. The phenomenon has been most frequently studied as a
precursor to the clinical problem of depression, but I have seen it
happen after a few bad experiences with everyday objects.
Do common technology and mathematics phobias result from
a kind of learned helplessness? Could a few instances of failure


**62** _The Design of Everyday Things_


in what appear to be straightforward situations generalize to every technological object, every mathematics problem? Perhaps. In
fact, the design of everyday things (and the design of mathematics
courses) seems almost guaranteed to cause this. We could call this
phenomenon taught helplessness.
When people have trouble using technology, especially when
they perceive (usually incorrectly) that nobody else is having the
same problems, they tend to blame themselves. Worse, the more
they have trouble, the more helpless they may feel, believing that
they must be technically or mechanically inept. This is just the opposite of the more normal situation where people blame their own
difficulties on the environment. This false blame is especially ironic
because the culprit here is usually the poor design of the technology, so blaming the environment (the technology) would be completely appropriate.
Consider the normal mathematics curriculum, which continues
relentlessly on its way, each new lesson assuming full knowledge
and understanding of all that has passed before. Even though each
point may be simple, once you fall behind it is hard to catch up.
The result: mathematics phobia—not because the material is difficult, but because it is taught so that difficulty in one stage hinders
further progress. The problem is that once failure starts, it is soon
generalized by self-blame to all of mathematics. Similar processes
are at work with technology. The vicious cycle starts: if you fail
at something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you
can’t do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task,
you believe you can’t, so you don’t even try. The result is that you
can’t, just as you thought.
You’re trapped in a self-fulfilling prophecy.


**POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY**


Just as we learn to give up after repeated failure, we can learn optimistic, positive responses to life. For years, psychologists focused
upon the gloomy story of how people failed, on the limits of human abilities, and on psychopathologies—depression, mania, paranoia, and so on. But the twenty-first century sees a new approach:


two: _The Psychology of Everyday Actions_ **63**


to focus upon a positive psychology, a culture of positive thinking,
of feeling good about oneself. In fact, the normal emotional state
of most people is positive. When something doesn’t work, it can
be considered an interesting challenge, or perhaps just a positive
learning experience.
We need to remove the word _failure_ from our vocabulary, replacing it instead with _learning experience._ To fail is to learn: we learn
more from our failures than from our successes. With success, sure,
we are pleased, but we often have no idea why we succeeded. With
failure, it is often possible to figure out why, to ensure that it will
never happen again.
Scientists know this. Scientists do experiments to learn how the
world works. Sometimes their experiments work as expected, but
often they don’t. Are these failures? No, they are learning experiences. Many of the most important scientific discoveries have
come from these so-called failures.

Failure can be such a powerful learning tool that many designers
take pride in their failures that happen while a product is still in
development. One design firm, IDEO, has it as a creed: “Fail often,
fail fast,” they say, for they know that each failure teaches them a
lot about what to do right. Designers need to fail, as do researchers. I have long held the belief—and encouraged it in my students
and employees—that failures are an essential part of exploration
and creativity. If designers and researchers do not sometimes fail, it
is a sign that they are not trying hard enough—they are not thinking the great creative thoughts that will provide breakthroughs in
how we do things. It is possible to avoid failure, to always be safe.
But that is also the route to a dull, uninteresting life.
The designs of our products and services must also follow this
philosophy. So, to the designers who are reading this, let me give
some advice:


   - Do not blame people when they fail to use your products properly.

   - Take people’s difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be
improved.


**64** _The Design of Everyday Things_


 - Eliminate all error messages from electronic or computer systems.
Instead, provide help and guidance.

 - Make it possible to correct problems directly from help and guidance
messages. Allow people to continue with their task: Don’t impede
progress—help make it smooth and continuous. Never make people

start over.

 - Assume that what people have done is partially correct, so if it is
inappropriate, provide the guidance that allows them to correct the
problem and be on their way.

 - Think positively, for yourself and for the people you interact with.
