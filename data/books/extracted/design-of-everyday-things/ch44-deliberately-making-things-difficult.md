**Deliberately Making Things Difficult**


_How can good design (design that is usable and understandable) be_
_balanced with the need for “secrecy” or privacy, or protection? That_
_is, some applications of design involve areas that are sensitive and ne-_
_cessitate strict control over who uses and understands them. Perhaps_
_we don’t want any user-in-the-street to understand enough of a sys-_
_tem to compromise its security. Couldn’t it be argued that some things_
_shouldn’t be designed well? Can’t things be left cryptic, so that only_

_those who have clearance, extended education, or whatever, can make_

_use of the system? Sure, we have passwords, keys, and other types of_
_security checks, but this can become wearisome for the privileged user. It_
_appears that if good design is not ignored in some contexts, the purpose_
_for the existence of the system will be nullified._ (A computer mail question


sent to me by a student, Dina Kurktchi. It is just the right question.)


In Stapleford, England, I came across a school door that was very
difficult to open, requiring simultaneous operation of two latches,
one at the very top of the door, the other down low. The latches
were difficult to find, to reach, and to use. But the difficulties were
deliberate. This was good design. The door was at a school for
handicapped children, and the school didn’t want the children to
be able to get out to the street without an adult. Only adults were
large enough to operate the two latches. Violating the rules of
ease of use is just what was needed.
Most things are intended to be easy to use, but aren’t. But some
things are deliberately difficult to use—and ought to be. The
number of things that should be difficult to use is surprisingly
large:


 - Any door designed to keep people in or out.

 - Security systems, designed so that only authorized people will be

able to use them.

 - Dangerous equipment, which should be restricted.

 - Dangerous operations that might lead to death or injury if done accidentally or in error.

   - Secret doors, cabinets, and safes: you don’t want the average person
even to know that they are there, let alone to be able to work them.

   - Cases deliberately intended to disrupt the normal routine action (as
discussed in Chapter 5). Examples include the acknowledgment required before permanently deleting a file from a computer, safeties
on pistols and rifles, and pins in fire extinguishers.

    - Controls that require two simultaneous actions before the system will
operate, with the controls separated so that it takes two people to
work them, preventing a single person from doing an unauthorized
action (used in security systems or safety-critical operations).

   - Cabinets and bottles for medications and dangerous substances deliberately made difficult to open to keep them secure from children.

   - Games, a category in which designers deliberately flout the laws of
understandability and usability. Games are meant to be difficult; in
some games, part of the challenge is to figure out what is to be done,

and how.


Even where a lack of usability or understandability is deliberate,
it is still important to know the rules of understandable and usable
design, for two reasons. First, even deliberately difficult designs
aren’t entirely difficult. Usually there is one difficult part, designed
to keep unauthorized people from using the device; the rest of it
should follow the normal principles of good design. Second, even
if your job is to make something difficult to do, you need to know
how to go about doing it. In this case, the rules are useful, for they
state in reverse just how to go about the task. You could systematically violate the rules like this:


   - Hide critical components: make things invisible.

    - Use unnatural mappings for the execution side of the action cycle, so
that the relationship of the controls to the things being controlled is
inappropriate or haphazard.

    - Make the actions physically difficult to do.

   - Require precise timing and physical manipulation.

   - Do not give any feedback.

 - Use unnatural mappings for the evaluation side of the action cycle,
so that system state is difficult to interpret.


Safety systems pose a special problem in design. Oftentimes, the
design feature added to ensure safety eliminates one danger, only
to create a secondary one. When workers dig a hole in a street,
they must put up barriers to prevent cars and people from falling
into the hole. The barriers solve one problem, but they themselves
pose another danger, often mitigated by adding signs and flashing
lights to warn of the barriers. Emergency doors, lights, and alarms
must often be accompanied by warning signs or barriers that control when and how they can be used.
