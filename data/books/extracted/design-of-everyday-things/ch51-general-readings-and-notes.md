###### GENERAL READINGS AND NOTES

In the notes below, I first provide general readings. Then, chapter
by chapter, I give the specific sources used or cited in the book.
In this world of rapid access to information, you can find information about the topics discussed here by yourself. Here is an example: In Chapter 5, I discuss root cause analysis as well as the
Japanese method called the Five Whys. Although my descriptions
of these concepts in Chapter 5 are self-sufficient for most purposes,
readers who wish to learn more can use their favorite search en
gine with the critical phrases in quotes.
Most of the relevant information can be found online. The problem is that the addresses (URLs) are ephemeral. Today’s locations
of valuable information may no longer be at the same place tomorrow. The creaky, untrustworthy Internet, which is all we have
today, may finally, thank goodness, be replaced by a superior
scheme. Whatever the reason, the Internet addresses I provide may
no longer work. The good news is that over the years that will
pass after the publication of this book, new and improved search
methods will certainly arise. It should be even easier to find more
information about any of the concepts discussed in this book.
These notes provide excellent starting points. I provide critical
references for the concepts discussed in the book, organized by



**305**


the chapters where they were discussed. The citations serve two
purposes. First, they provide credit to the originators of the ideas.
Second, they serve as starting points to get a deeper understanding
of the concepts. For more advanced information (as well as newer,
further developments), go out and search. Enhanced search skills
are important tools for success in the twenty-first century.


**GENERAL READINGS**


When the first edition of this book was published, the discipline
of interaction design did not exist, the field of human-computer
interaction was in its infancy, and most studies were done under
the guise of “usability” or “user interface.” Several very different
disciplines were struggling to bring clarity to this enterprise, but
often with little or no interaction among the disciplines. The academic disciplines of computer science, psychology, human factors, and ergonomics all knew of one another’s existence and often
worked together, but design was not included. Why not design?
Note that all the disciplines just listed are in the areas of science
and engineering—in other words, technology. Design was then
mostly taught in schools of art or architecture as a profession
rather than as a research-based academic discipline. Designers had
remarkably little contact with science and engineering. This meant
that although many excellent practitioners were trained, there was
essentially no theory: design was learned through apprenticeship,
mentorship, and experience.
Few people in the academic disciplines were aware of the existence of design as a serious enterprise, and as a result, design,
and in particular, graphical, communication, and industrial design worked completely independently of the newly emerging
discipline of human-computer interaction and the existing disciplines of human factors and ergonomics. Some product design was
taught in departments of mechanical engineering, but again, with
little interaction with design. Design was simply not an academic
discipline, so there was little or no mutual awareness or collaboration. Traces of this distinction remain today, although design is
more and more becoming a research-based discipline, where pro

**306** _General Readings_


fessors have experience in practice as well as PhDs. The boundaries are disappearing.
This peculiar history of many independent, disparate groups all
working on similar issues makes it difficult to provide references
that cover both the academic side of interaction and experience
design, and the applied side of design. The proliferation of books,
texts, and journals in human-computer interaction, experience design, and usability is huge: too large to cite. In the materials that
follow, I provide a very restricted number of examples. When I
originally put together a list of works I considered important, it
was far too long. It fell prey to the problem described by Barry
Schwartz in his book _The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less_ (2005).
So I decided to simplify by providing less. It is easy to find other
works, including important ones that will be published after this
book. Meanwhile, my apologies to my many friends whose important and useful works had to be trimmed from my list.
Industrial designer Bill Moggridge was extremely influential in
establishing interaction within the design community. He played a
major role in the design of the first portable computer. He was one
of the three founders of IDEO, one of the world’s most influential
design firms. He wrote two books of interviews with key people
in the early development of the discipline: _Designing Interactions_
(2007) and _Designing Media_ (2010). As is typical of discussions from
the discipline of design, his works focus almost entirely upon the
practice of design, with little attention to the science. Barry Katz, a
design professor at San Francisco’s California College of the Arts,
Stanford’s d.school, and an IDEO Fellow, provides an excellent
history of design practice within the community of companies
in Silicon Valley, California: _Ecosystem of Innovation: The History of_
_Silicon Valley Design_ (2014). An excellent, extremely comprehensive history of the field of product design is provided by Bernhard Bürdek’s _Design: History, Theory, and Practice of Product Design_
(2005). Bürdek’s book, originally published in German but with an
excellent English translation, is the most comprehensive history of
product design I have been able to find. I highly recommend it to
those who want to understand the historical foundations.


_General Readings_ **307**


Modern designers like to characterize their work as providing
deep insight into the fundamentals of problems, going far beyond
the popular conception of design as making things pretty. Designers emphasize this aspect of their profession by discussing the special way in which they approach problems, a method they have
characterized as “design thinking.” A good introduction to this
comes from the book _Change by Design_ (2009), by Tim Brown and
Barry Katz. Brown is CEO of IDEO and Katz an IDEO Fellow (see
the previous paragraph).
An excellent introduction to design research is provided in Jan
Chipchase and Simon Steinhardt’s _Hidden in Plain Sight_ (2013).
The book chronicles the life of a design researcher who studies
people by observing them in their homes, barber shops, and living quarters around the world. Chipchase is executive creative
director of global insights at Frog Design, working out of the
Shanghai office. The work of Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt
in _Contextual Design: Defining Customer-Centered Systems_ (1998)
presents a powerful method of analyzing behavior; they have
also produced a useful workbook (Holtzblatt, Wendell, & Wood,
2004).
There are many excellent books. Here are a few more:


Buxton, W. (2007). _Sketching user experience: Getting the design right and the right_
_design_ . San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufmann. (And see the companion
workbook [Greenberg, Carpendale, Marquardt, & Buxton, 2012].)
Coates, D. (2003). _Watches tell more than time: Product design, information, and the_
_quest for elegance_ . New York: McGraw-Hill.
Cooper, A., Reimann, R., & Cronin, D. (2007). _About face 3: The essentials of_
_interaction design_ . Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub.
Hassenzahl, M. (2010). _Experience design: Technology for all the right reasons_ . San
Rafael, California: Morgan & Claypool.
Moggridge, B. (2007). _Designing interactions_ . Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. http://
www.designinginteractions.com. Chapter 10 describes the methods of
interaction design: http://www.designinginteractions.com/chapters/10


Two handbooks provide comprehensive, detailed treatments of the
topics in this book:


**308** _General Readings_


Jacko, J. A. (2012). _The human-computer interaction handbook: Fundamentals,_
_evolving technologies, and emerging applications_ (3rd edition). Boca Raton,
FL: CRC Press.
Lee, J. D., & Kirlik, A. (2013). _The Oxford handbook of cognitive engineering_ . New
York: Oxford University Press.


Which book should you look at? Both are excellent, and although
expensive, well worth the price for anyone who intends to work
in these fields. The _Human-Computer Interaction Handbook_, as the title suggests, focuses primarily on computer-enhanced interactions
with technology, whereas the _Handbook of Cognitive Engineering_ has
a much broader coverage. Which book is better? That depends upon
what problem you are working on. For my work, both are essential.
Finally, let me recommend two websites:


Interaction Design Foundation: Take special note of its Encyclopedia articles.
www.interaction-design.org
SIGCHI: The Computer-Human Interaction Special Interest Group for ACM.

**CHAPTER ONE: THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS**


2 _Coffeepot for Masochists:_ This was created by the French artist Jacques
Carelman (1984). The photograph shows a coffeepot inspired by
Carelman, but owned by me. Photograph by Aymin Shamma for the
author.
10 _Affordances:_ The perceptual psychologist J. J. Gibson invented the word
_affordance_ to explain how people navigated the world (Gibson, 1979).
I introduced the term into the world of interaction design in the first
edition of this book (Norman, 1988). Since then, the number of writings
on affordance has been enormous. Confusion over the appropriate way
to use the term prompted me to introduce the concept of “signifier” in
my book _Living with Complexity_ (Norman, 2010), discussed throughout
this book, but especially in Chapters 1 and 4.


**CHAPTER TWO: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY ACTIONS**


38 _Gulfs of execution and evaluation:_ The story of the gulfs and bridges of
execution and evaluation came from research performed with Ed
Hutchins and Jim Hollan, then part of a joint research team between the
Naval Personnel Research and Development Center and the University
of California, San Diego (Hollan and Hutchins are now professors of


_Notes to Chapter 2_ **309**


cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego). The work
examined the development of computer systems that were easier to
learn and easier to use, and in particular, of what has been called
direct manipulation computer systems. The initial work is described
in the chapter “Direct Manipulation Interfaces” in the book from our
laboratories, _User Centered System Design: New_ _Perspectives on Human-_
_Computer Interaction_ (Hutchins, Hollan, & Norman, 1986). Also see the
paper by Hollan, Hutchins, and David Kirsh, “Distributed Cognition: A
New Foundation for Human-Computer Interaction Research” (Hollan,
Hutchins, & Kirsh, 2000).
43 _Levitt:_ “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarterinch hole!” See Christensen, Cook, & Hal, 2006. The fact that Harvard
Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt is credited with
the quote about the drill and the hole is a good example of Stigler’s law:
“No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer.” Thus,
Levitt himself attributed the statement about drills and holes to Leo
McGinneva (Levitt, 1983). Stigler’s law is, itself, an example of the law:
Stigler, a professor of statistics, wrote that he learned the law from the
sociologist Robert Merton. See more at Wikipedia, “Stigler’s Law of
Eponymy” (Wikipedia contributors, 2013c).
46 _Doorknob:_ The question “In the house you lived in three houses ago, as
you entered the front door, was the doorknob on the left or right?” comes
from my paper “Memory, Knowledge, and the Answering of Questions”
(Norman, 1973).
53 _Visceral, behavioral, and reflective:_ Daniel Kahneman’s book, _Thinking Fast_
_and Slow_ (Kahneman, 2011), gives an excellent introduction to modern
conceptions of the role of conscious and subconscious processing. The
distinctions between visceral, behavioral, and reflective processing
form the basis of my book _Emotional Design_ (Norman, 2002, 2004). This
model of the human cognitive and emotional system is described in
more technical detail in the scientific paper I wrote with Andrew Ortony
and William Revelle: “The Role of Affect and Proto-affect in Effective
Functioning” (Ortony, Norman, & Revelle, 2005). Also see “Designers
and Users: Two Perspectives on Emotion and Design” (Norman &
Ortony, 2006). _Emotional Design_ contains numerous examples of the role
of design at all three levels.
58 _Thermostat:_ The valve theory of the thermostat is taken from Kempton,
a study published in the journal _Cognitive Science_ (1986). Intelligent
thermostats try to predict when they will be required, turning on or
off earlier than the simple control illustrated in Chapter 2 can specify,
to ensure that the desired temperature is reached at the desired time,
without over- or undershooting the target.
63 _Positive psychology:_ Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s work on flow can be found
in his several books on the topic (1990, 1997). Martin (Marty) Seligman
developed the concept of learned helplessness, and then applied it to
depression (Seligman, 1992). However, he decided that it was wrong for


**310** _Notes to Chapter 2_


psychology to continually focus upon difficulties and abnormalities,
so he teamed up with Csikszentmihalyi to create a movement for
positive psychology. An excellent introduction is provided in the article
by the two of them in the journal _American Psychologist_ (Seligman &
Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Since then, positive psychology has expanded
to include books, journals, and conferences.
66 _Human error:_ People blame themselves: Unfortunately, blaming the user
is imbedded in the legal system. When major accidents occur, official
courts of inquiry are set up to assess the blame. More and more often, the
blame is attributed to “human error.” But in my experience, human error
usually is a result of poor design: why was the system ever designed so
that a single act by a single person could cause calamity? An important
book on this topic is Charles Perrow’s _Normal Accidents_ (1999). Chapter 5
of this book provides a detailed examination of human error.
72 _Feedforward:_ Feedforward is an old concept from control theory, but I
first encountered it applied to the seven stages of action in the paper
by Jo Vermeulen, Kris Luyten, Elise van den Hoven, and Karin Coninx
(2013).


**CHAPTER THREE: KNOWLEDGE IN THE HEAD AND IN THE WORLD**


74 _American coins:_ Ray Nickerson and Marilyn Adams, as well as David
Rubin and Theda Kontis, showed that people could neither recall
nor recognize accurately the pictures and words on American coins
(Nickerson & Adams, 1979; Rubin & Kontis, 1983).
80 _French coins:_ The quotation about the French government release of the
10-franc coin comes from an article by Stanley Meisler (1986), reprinted
with permission of the _Los Angeles Times_ .
80 _Descriptions in memory:_ The suggestion that memory storage and retrieval
is mediated through partial descriptions was put forth in a paper with
Danny Bobrow (Norman & Bobrow, 1979). We argued that, in general,
the required specificity of a description depends on the set of items
among which a person is trying to distinguish. Memory retrieval can
therefore involve a prolonged series of attempts during which the initial
retrieval descriptions yield incomplete or erroneous results, so that the
person must keep trying, each retrieval attempt coming closer to the
answer and helping to make the description more precise.
83 _Constraints of rhyming:_ Given just the cues for meaning (the first task),
the people David C. Rubin and Wanda T. Wallace tested could guess the
three target words used in these examples only 0 percent, 4 percent, and
0 percent of the time, respectively. Similarly, when the same target words
were cued only by rhymes, they still did quite poorly, guessing the targets
correctly only 0 percent, 0 percent, and 4 percent of the time, respectively.
Thus, each cue alone offered little assistance. Combining the meaning
cue with the rhyming cue led to perfect performance: the people got the
target words 100 percent of the time (Rubin & Wallace, 1989).


_Notes to Chapter 3_ **311**


86 _‘Ali Baba:_ Alfred Bates Lord’s work is summarized in his book _The Singer_
_of Tales_ (1960). The quotation from “‘Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves”
comes from _The Arabian Nights: Tales of Wonder and Magnificence_, selected
and edited by Padraic Colum, translated by Edward William Lane
(Colum & Ward, 1953). The names here are in an unfamiliar form: most
of us know the magic phrase as “Open Sesame,” but according to Colum,
“Simsim” is the authentic transliteration.
87 _Passwords:_ How do people cope with passwords? There are lots of studies:
(Anderson, 2008; Florêncio, Herley, & Coskun, 2007; National Research
Council Steering Committee on the Usability, Security, and Privacy of
Computer Systems, 2010; Norman, 2009; Schneier, 2000).
To find the most common passwords, just search using some phrase
such as “most common passwords.” My article on security, which led
to numerous newspaper column references to it, is available on my
website and was also published in the magazine for human-computer
interaction, _Interactions_ (Norman, 2009).
89 _Hiding places:_ The quotation about professional thieves’ knowledge of
how people hide things comes from Winograd and Soloway’s study “On
Forgetting the Locations of Things Stored in Special Places” (1986).
93 _Mnemonics:_ Mnemonic methods were covered in my book _Memory and_
_Attention_, and although that book is old, the mnemonic techniques are
even older, and are still unchanged (Norman, 1969, 1976). I discuss the
effort of retrieval in _Learning and Memory_ (Norman, 1982). Mnemonic
techniques are easy to find: just search the web for “mnemonics.”
Similarly, the properties of short- and long-term memory are readily
found by an Internet search or in any text on experimental psychology,
cognitive psychology, or neuropsychology (as opposed to clinical
psychology) or a text on cognitive science. Alternatively, search online
for “human memory,” “working memory,” “short-term memory” or
“long-term memory.” Also see the book by Harvard psychologist Daniel
Schacter, _The Seven Sins of Memory_ (2001). What are Schacter’s seven sins?
Transience, absent-mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility,
persistence, and bias.
101 _Whitehead:_ Alfred North Whitehead’s quotation about the power of
automated behavior is from Chapter 5 of his book _An Introduction to_
_Mathematics_ (1911).
107 _Prospective memory:_ Considerable research on prospective memory and
memory for the future is summarized in the articles by Dismukes on
prospective memory and the review by Cristina Atance and Daniela
O’Neill on memory for the future, or what they call “episodic future
thinking” (Atance & O’Neill, 2001; Dismukes, 2012).
112 _Transactive memory:_ The term _transactive memory_ was coined by Harvard
professor of psychology Daniel Wegner (Lewis & Herndon, 2011; Wegner,
D. M., 1987; Wegner, T. G., & Wegner, D. M., 1995).
113 _Stove controls:_ The difficulty in mapping stove controls to burners has
been understood by human factors experts for over fifty years: Why are


**312** _Notes to Chapter 3_


stoves still designed so badly? This issue was addressed in 1959, the very
first year of the _Human Factors Journal_ (Chapanis & Lindenbaum, 1959).
118 _Culture and design:_ My discussion of the impact of culture on mappings
was heavily informed by my discussions with Lera Boroditsky, then
at Stanford University, but now in the cognitive science department
at the University of California, San Diego. See her book chapter “How
Languages Construct Time” (2011). Studies of the Australian Aborigine
were reported by Núñez & Sweetser (2006).


**CHAPTER FOUR: KNOWING WHAT TO DO:**

**CONSTRAINTS, DISCOVERABILITY, AND FEEDBACK**


126 _InstaLoad:_ A description of Microsoft’s InstaLoad technology for battery
contacts is available on its website: www.microsoft.com/hardware
/en-us/support/licensing-instaload-overview.
129 _Cultural frames:_ See Roger Schank and Robert B. Abelson’s _Scripts,_
_Plans, Goals, and Understanding_ (1977) or Erving Goffman’s classic and
extremely influential books _The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life_ (1959)
and _Frame Analysis_ (1974). I recommend _Presentation_ as the most relevant
(and easiest to read) of his works.
129 _Violating social conventions:_ “Try violating cultural norms and see how
uncomfortable that makes you and the other people.” Jan Chipchase and
Simon Steinhardt’s _Hidden in Plain Sight_ provides many examples of how
design researchers can deliberately violate social conventions so as to
understand how a culture works. Chipchase reports an experiment in
which able-bodied young people request that seated subway passengers
give up their seat to them. The experimenters were surprised by two
things. First, a large proportion of people obeyed. Second, the people
most affected were the experimenters themselves: they had to force
themselves to make the requests and then felt bad about it for a long
time afterward. A deliberate violation of social constraints can be
uncomfortable for both the violator and the violated (Chipchase &
Steinhardt, 2013).
137 _Light switch panel:_ For the construction of my home light switch panel,
I relied heavily on the electrical and mechanical ingenuity of Dave
Wargo, who actually did the design, construction, and installation of the
switches.
156 _Natural sounds:_ Bill Gaver, now a prominent design researcher at
Goldsmiths College, University of London (UK), first alerted me to
the importance of natural sounds in his PhD dissertation and later
publications (Gaver, W., 1997; Gaver, W. W., 1989). There has been
considerable research on sound since the early days: see, for example,
Gygi & Shafiro (2010).
160 _Electric vehicles:_ The quotation from the US government rule on sounds
for electric vehicles can be found on the Department of Transportation’s
website (2013).


_Notes to Chapter 4_ **313**


**CHAPTER FIVE: HUMAN ERROR? NO, BAD DESIGN**


There has been a lot of work on the study of error, human reliability, and resilience. A good source, besides the items cited below, is
the Wiki of Science article on human error (Wiki of Science, 2013).
Also see the book _Behind Human Error_ (Woods, Decker, Cook, Johannesen, & Sarter, 2010).
Two of the most important workers in human error are British
psychologist James Reason and Danish engineer Jens Rasmussen.
Also see the books by the Swedish investigator Sidney Dekker, and
MIT professor Nancy Leveson (Dekker, 2011, 2012, 2013; Leveson,
N., 2012; Leveson, N. G., 1995; Rasmussen, Duncan, & Leplat, 1987;
Rasmussen, Pejtersen, & Goodstein, 1994; Reason, J. T., 1990, 2008).
Unless otherwise noted, all the examples of slips in this chapter
were collected by me, primarily from the errors of myself, my research associates, my colleagues, and my students. Everyone diligently recorded his or her slips, with the requirement that only the
ones that had been immediately recorded would be added to the
collection. Many were first published in Norman (1981).


165 _F-22 crash:_ The analysis of the Air Force F-22 crash comes from a government
report (Inspector General United States Department of Defense, 2013).
(This report also contains the original Air Force report as Appendix C.)
170 _Slips and mistakes:_ The descriptions of skill-based, rule-based, and
knowledge-based behavior is taken from Jens Rasmussen’s paper on
the topic (1983), which still stands as one of the best introductions. The
classification of errors into slips and mistakes was done jointly by me and
Reason. The classification of mistakes into rule-based and knowledgebased follows the work of Rasmussen (Rasmussen, Goodstein, Andersen,
& Olsen, 1988; Rasmussen, Pejtersen, & Goodstein, 1994; Reason, J. T.,
1990, 1997, 2008). Memory lapse errors (both slips and mistakes) were not
originally distinguished from other errors: they were put into separate
categories later, but not quite the same way I have done here.
172 _“Gimli Glider”:_ The so-called Gimli Glider accident was an Air Canada Boeing 767 that ran out of fuel and had to glide to a landing at Gimli, a decommissioned Canadian Air Force base. There were numerous mistakes:
search for “Gimli Glider accident.” (I recommend the Wikipedia treatment.)
174 _Capture error:_ The category “capture error” was invented by James
Reason (1979).
178 _Airbus:_ The difficulties with the Airbus and its modes are described
in (Aviation Safety Network, 1992; Wikipedia contributors, 2013a). For
a disturbing description of another design problem with the Airbus—


**314** _Notes to Chapter 5_


that the two pilots (the captain and the first officer) can both control the
joysticks, but there is no feedback, so one pilot does not know what the other
pilot is doing—see the article in the British newspaper _The Telegraph_
(Ross & Tweedie, 2012).
181 _The Kiss nightclub fire in Santa Maria, Brazil:_ It is described in numerous
Brazilian and American newspapers (search the web for “Kiss nightclub
fire”). I first learned about it from the _New York Times_ (Romero, 2013).
186 _Tenerife crash:_ My source for information about the Tenerife crash is from
a report by Roitsch, Babcock, and Edmunds issued by the American
Airline Pilots Association (Roitsch, Babcock, & Edmunds, undated).
It is perhaps not too surprising that it differs in interpretation from
the Spanish government’s report (Spanish Ministry of Transport and
Communications, 1978), which in turn differs from the report by the
Dutch Aircraft Accident Inquiry Board. A nice review of the 1977 Tenerife
accident—written in 2007—that shows its long-lasting importance has
been written by Patrick Smith for the website Salon.com (Smith, 2007,
Friday, April 6, 04:00 AM PDT).
188 _Air Florida crash:_ The information and quotations about the Air Florida
crash are from the report of the National Transportation Safety Board
(1982). See also the two books entitled _Pilot Error_ (Hurst, 1976; Hurst, R. &
Hurst, L. R., 1982). The two books are quite different. The second is better
than the first, in part because at the time the first book was written, not
much scientific evidence was available.
190 _Checklists in medicine:_ Duke University’s examples of knowledge-based
mistakes can be found at Duke University Medical Center (2013). An
excellent summary of the use of checklists in medicine—and the many
social pressures that have slowed up its adoption—is provided by Atul
Gawande (2009).
192 _Jidoka:_ The quotation from Toyota about _Jidoka,_ and the Toyota
Production System comes from the auto maker’s website (Toyota Motor
Europe Corporate Site, 2013). Poka-yoke is described in many books and
websites. I found the two books written by or with the assistance of the
originator, Shigeo Shingo, to provide a valuable perspective (Nikkan
Kogyo Shimbun, 1988; Shingo, 1986).
193 _Aviation safety:_ The website for NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System
provides details of the system, along with a history of its reports (NASA,
2013).
197 _Hindsight:_ Baruch Fischhoff’s study is called “Hindsight ≠ Foresight:
The Effect of Outcome Knowledge on Judgment Under Uncertainty”
(1975). And while you are at it, see his more recent work (Fischhoff, 2012;
Fischhoff & Kadvany, 2011).
198 _Designing for error:_ I discuss the idea of designing for error in a paper
in _Communications of the ACM,_ in which I analyze a number of the slips
people make in using computer systems and suggest system design
principles that might minimize those errors (Norman, 1983). This
philosophy also pervades the book that our research team put together:


_Notes to Chapter 5_ **315**


_User Centered System Design_ (Norman & Draper, 1986); two chapters are
especially relevant to the discussions here: my “Cognitive Engineering”
and the one I wrote with Clayton Lewis, “Designing for Error.”
200 _Multitasking:_ There are many studies of the dangers and inefficiencies of
multitasking. A partial review is given by Spink, Cole, & Waller (2008).
David L. Strayer and his colleagues at the University of Utah have done
numerous studies demonstrating rather severe impairment in driving
behavior while using cell phones (Strayer & Drews, 2007; Strayer, Drews,
& Crouch, 2006). Even pedestrians are distracted by cell phone usage,
as demonstrated by a team of researchers from West Washington
University (Hyman, Boss, Wise, McKenzie, & Caggiano, 2010).
200 _Unicycling clown:_ The clever study of the invisible clown, riding a
unicycle, “Did you see the unicycling clown? Inattentional blindness
while walking and talking on a cell phone” was done by Hyman, Boss,
Wise, McKenzie, & Caggiano (2010).
208 _Swiss cheese model:_ James Reason introduced his extremely influential
Swiss cheese model in 1990 (Reason, J., 1990; Reason, J. T., 1997).
210 _Hersman:_ Deborah Hersman’s description of the design philosophy for
aircraft comes from her talk on February 7, 2013, discussing the NTSB’s
attempts to understand the cause of the fires in the battery compartments
of Boeing 787 aircraft. Although the fires caused airplanes to make
emergency landings, no passengers or crew were injured: the multiple
layers of redundant protection maintained safety. Nonetheless, the
fires and resulting damage were unexpected and serious enough that
all Boeing 787 airlines were grounded until all parties involved had
completed a thorough investigation of the causes of the incident and
then gone through a new certification process with the Federal Aviation
Agency (for the United States, and through the corresponding agencies in
other countries). Although this was expensive and greatly inconvenient, it
is an example of good proactive practice: take measures before accidents
lead to injury and death (National Transportation Safety Board, 2013).
212 _Resilience engineering:_ The excerpt from “Prologue: Resilience Engineering
Concepts,” in the book _Resilience Engineering,_ is reprinted by permission
of the publishers (Hollnagel, Woods, & Leveson, 2006).
213 _Automation:_ Much of my research and writings have addressed issues of
automation. An early paper, “Coffee Cups in the Cockpit,” addresses this
problem as well as the fact that when talking about incidents in a large
country—or that occur worldwide—a “one-in-a-million chance” is not
good enough odds (Norman, 1992). My book _The Design of Future Things_
deals extensively with this issue (Norman, 2007).
214 Royal Majesty _accident:_ An excellent analysis of the mode error accident
with the cruise ship _Royal Majesty_ is contained in Asaf Degani’s book on
automation, _Taming HAL: Designing Interfaces Beyond 2001_ (Degani, 2004), as
well as in the analyses by Lützhöft and Dekker and the official NTSB report
(Lützhöft & Dekker, 2002; National Transportation Safety Board, 1997).

**CHAPTER SIX: DESIGN THINKING**


As pointed out in the “General Readings” section, a good introduction to design thinking is _Change by Design_ by Tim Brown and
Barry Katz (2009). Brown is CEO of IDEO and Katz a professor at
the California College of the Arts, visiting professor at Stanford’s
d.school, and an IDEO Fellow. There are multiple Internet sources;
I like designthinkingforeducators.com.


220 _Double diverge-converge pattern:_ The double diverge-converge pattern was
first introduced by the British Design Council in 2005, which called it the
_“_ Double-Diamond Design Process Model” (Design Council, 2005).
221 _HCD process:_ The human-centered design process has many variants,
each similar in spirit but different in the details. A nice summary of the
method I describe is provided by the HCD book and toolkit from the
design firm IDEO (IDEO, 2013).
227 _Prototyping:_ For prototyping, see Buxton’s book and handbook on
sketching (Buxton, 2007; Greenberg, Carpendale, Marquardt, & Buxton,
2012). There are multiple methods used by designers to understand the
nature of the problem and come to a potential solution. Vijay Kumar’s
_101 Design Methods_ (2013) doesn’t even cover them all. Kumar’s book is
an excellent treatment of design research methods, but its focus is on
innovation, not the production of products, so it does not cover the actual
development cycle. Physical prototyping, their tests, and iterations are
outside the domain, as are the practical concerns of the marketplace, the
topic of the last part of this chapter and all of chapter 7.
227 _Wizard of Oz technique:_ The Wizard of Oz technique is named after
L. Frank Baum’s book _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ (Baum & Denslow,
1900). My use of the technique is described in the resulting paper from
the group headed by artificial intelligence researcher Danny Bobrow at
what was then called the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Bobrow
et al., 1977). The “graduate student” sitting in the other room was Allen
Munro, who then went on to a distinguished research career.
229 _Nielsen:_ Jakob Nielsen’s argument that five users is the ideal number for
most tests can be found on the Nielsen Norman group’s website (Nielsen,
2013).
233 _Three goals:_ Marc Hassenzahl’s use of the three levels of goals (be-goals,
do-goals, and motor-goals) is described in many places, but I strongly
recommend his book _Experience Design_ (Hassenzahl, 2010). The three
goals come from the work of Charles Carver and Michael Scheier in their
landmark book on the use of feedback models, chaos, and dynamical
theory to explain much of human behavior (Carver & Scheier, 1998).
246 _Age and performance:_ A good review of the impact of age on human factors
is provided by Frank Schieber (2003). The report by Igo Grossman and


_Notes to Chapter 6_ **317**


colleagues is a typical example of research showing that careful studies
reveal superior performance with age (Grossmann et al., 2010).
254 _Swatch International Time:_ Swatch’s development of .beat time and the
French decimal time are discussed in the Wikipedia article on decimal
time (Wikipedia contributors, 2013b).


**CHAPTER SEVEN: DESIGN IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS**


261 _Creeping featurism:_ A note for the technology historians. I’ve managed to
trace the origin of this term to a talk by John Mashey in 1976 (Mashey,
1976). At that time Mashey was a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories,
where he was one of the early developers of UNIX, a well-known
computer operating system (which is still active as Unix, Linux, and the
kernel underlying Apple’s Mac OS).
262 _Youngme Moon:_ Youngme Moon’s book _Different: Escaping the Competitive_
_Herd_ (Moon, 2010) argues that “If there is one strain of conventional
wisdom pervading every company in every industry, it is the importance
of competing hard to differentiate yourself from the competition. And
yet going head-to-head with the competition—with respect to features,
product augmentations, and so on—has the perverse effect of making
you just like everyone else.” (From the jacket of her book: see http://
youngmemoon.com/Jacket.html.)
266 _Word-gesture system:_ The word-gesture system that works by tracing the
letters on the screen keyboard to type rapidly and efficiently (although
not as fast as with a traditional ten-finger keyboard) is described in
considerable detail by Shumin Zhai and Per Ola Kristensson, two of the
developers of this method of typing (Zhai & Kristensson, 2012).
269 _Multitouch screens:_ In the more than thirty years multitouch screens have
been in the laboratories, numerous companies have launched products
and failed. Nimish Mehta is credited with the invention of multitouch,
discussed in his master’s thesis (1982) from the University of Toronto.
Bill Buxton (2012), one of the pioneers in this field, provides a valuable
review (he was working with multitouch displays in the early 1980s at
the University of Toronto). Another excellent review of multitouch and
gestural systems in general (as well as design principles) is provided
by Dan Saffer in his book _Designing Gestural Interfaces_ (2009). The story
of Fingerworks and Apple is readily found by searching the web for
“Fingerworks.”
270 _Stigler’s law:_ See the comment about this in the notes for Chapter 2.
271 _Telephonoscope:_ The illustration of the “Telephonoscope” was originally
published in the December 9, 1878, issue of the British magazine _Punch_
(for its 1879 Almanack). The picture comes from Wikipedia (Wikipedia
contributors, 2013d), where it is in the public domain because of its age.
276 _QWERTY keyboard:_ The history of the QWERTY keyboard is discussed
in numerous articles. I thank Professor Neil Kay of University of
Strathclyde for our e-mail correspondence and his article “Rerun the


**318** _Notes to Chapter 7_


Tape of History and QWERTY Always Wins” (2013). This article led me
to the “QWERTY People Archive” website by the Japanese researchers
Koichi and Motoko Yasuoka, an incredibly detailed, valuable resource
for those interested in the history of the keyboard, and in particular,
of the QWERTY configuration (Yasuoka & Yasuoka, 2013). The article
on the typewriter in the 1872 _Scientific American_ is fun to read: the style
of _Scientific American_ has changed drastically since then (Anonymous,
1872).
278 _Dvorak keyboard:_ Is Dvorak faster than QWERTY? Yes, but not by much:
Diane Fisher and I studied a variety of keyboard layouts. We thought that
alphabetically organized keys would be superior for beginners. No, they
weren’t: we discovered that knowledge of the alphabet was not useful
in finding the keys. Our studies of alphabetical and Dvorak keyboards
were published in the journal _Human Factors_ (Norman & Fisher, 1984).
Admirers of the Dvorak keyboard claim much more than a 10 percent
improvement, as well as faster learning rates and less fatigue. But I
will stick by my studies and my statements. If you want to read more,
including a worthwhile treatment of the history of the typewriter, see
the book _Cognitive Aspects of Skilled Typewriting_, edited by William E.
Cooper, which includes several chapters of research from my laboratory
(Cooper, W. E., 1963; Norman & Fisher, 1984; Norman & Rumelhart, 1963;
Rumelhart & Norman, 1982).
278 _Keyboard ergonomics:_ Health aspects of keyboards are reported in
National Institute of Health (2013).
279 _Incremental and radical innovation:_ The Italian business professor Roberto
Verganti and I discuss the principles of incremental and radical
innovation (Norman & Verganti, 2014; Verganti, 2009, 2010).
281 _Hill climbing:_ There are very good descriptions of the hill-climbing
process for design in Christopher Alexander’s book _Notes on the Synthesis_
_of Form_ (1964) and Chris Jones’s book _Design Methods_ (1992; also see Jones,
1984).
286 _Humans versus machines:_ The remarks by MIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson
were made in his talk at the June 2012 National Academy of Engineering
symposium on manufacturing, design, and innovation (Brynjolfsson,
2012). His book, coauthored with Andrew McAfee— _Race Against the_
_Machine: How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving_

—
_Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy_
contains an excellent treatment of design and innovation (Brynjolfsson
& McAfee, 2011).
290 _Interactive media:_ Al Gore’s interactive media book is _Our Choice_ (2011).
Some of the videos from my early interactive book are still available: see
Norman (1994 and 2011b).
295 _Rise of the small:_ The section “The Rise of the Small” is taken from my
essay written for the hundredth anniversary of the Steelcase company,
reprinted here with Steelcase’s permission (Norman, 2011a).
