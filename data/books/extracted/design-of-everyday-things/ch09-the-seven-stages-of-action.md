**The Seven Stages of Action**


There are two parts to an action: executing the action and then
evaluating the results: doing and interpreting. Both execution and
evaluation require understanding: how the item works and what
results it produces. Both execution and evaluation can affect our
emotional state.

Suppose I am sitting in my armchair, reading a book. It is dusk,
and the light is getting dimmer and dimmer. My current activity
is reading, but that goal is starting to fail because of the decreasing
illumination. This realization triggers a new goal: get more light.
How do I do that? I have many choices. I could open the curtains,
move so that I sit where there is more light, or perhaps turn on a
nearby light. This is the planning stage, determining which of the
many possible plans of action to follow. But even when I decide
to turn on the nearby light, I still have to determine how to get it
done. I could ask someone to do it for me, I could use my left hand
or my right. Even after I have decided upon a plan, I still have to
specify how I will do it. Finally, I must execute—do—the action.
When I am doing a frequent act, one for which I am quite experienced and skilled, most of these stages are subconscious. When I
am still learning how to do it, determining the plan, specifying the
sequence, and interpreting the result are conscious.
Suppose I am driving in my car and my action plan requires me
to make a left turn at a street intersection. If I am a skilled driver,
I don’t have to give much conscious attention to specify or perform the action sequence. I think “left” and smoothly execute the
required action sequence. But if I am just learning to drive, I have
to think about each separate component of the action. I must apply the brakes and check for cars behind and around me, cars and

and whether there are traf
fic signs or signals that I
have to obey. I must move
my feet back and forth between pedals and my hands
to the turn signals and back
to the steering wheel (while
I try to remember just how
my instructor told me I
should position my hands
while making a turn), and
my visual attention is di- **FIGURE 2.2.** **The Seven Stages of the Action**

times rotating my head,
and sometimes using the rear- and side-view mirrors. To the skilled
driver, it is all easy and straightforward. To the beginning driver,
the task seems impossible.
The specific actions bridge the gap between what we would
like to have done (our goals) and all possible physical actions to
achieve those goals. After we specify what actions to make, we
must actually do them—the stages of execution. There are three
stages of execution that follow from the goal: plan, specify, and
perform (the left side of Figure 2.2). Evaluating what happened has
three stages: first, perceiving what happened in the world; second,
trying to make sense of it (interpreting it); and, finally, comparing
what happened with what was wanted (the right side of Figure 2.2).
There we have it. Seven stages of action: one for goals, three for
execution, and three for evaluation (Figure 2.2).

The seven-stage action cycle is simplified, but it provides a useful framework for understanding human action and for guiding
design. It has proven to be helpful in designing interaction. Not all
of the activity in the stages is conscious. Goals tend to be, but even
they may be subconscious. We can do many actions, repeatedly
cycling through the stages while being blissfully unaware that we
are doing so. It is only when we come across something new or
reach some impasse, some problem that disrupts the normal flow
of activity, that conscious attention is required.
Most behavior does not require going through all stages in sequence; however, most activities will not be satisfied by single actions. There must be numerous sequences, and the whole activity
may last hours or even days. There are multiple feedback loops
in which the results of one activity are used to direct further ones, in
which goals lead to subgoals, and plans lead to subplans. There are
activities in which goals are forgotten, discarded, or reformulated.
Let’s go back to my act of turning on the light. This is a case of
event-driven behavior: the sequence starts with the world, causing evaluation of the state and the formulation of a goal. The trigger was an environmental event: the lack of light, which made
reading difficult. This led to a violation of the goal of reading, so
it led to a subgoal—get more light. But reading was not the highlevel goal. For each goal, one has to ask, “Why is that the goal?”
Why was I reading? I was trying to prepare a meal using a new
recipe, so I needed to reread it before I started. Reading was thus
a subgoal. But cooking was itself a subgoal. I was cooking in order to eat, which had the goal of satisfying my hunger. So the
hierarchy of goals is roughly: satisfy hunger; eat; cook; read cookbook; get more light. This is called a root cause analysis: asking
“Why?” until the ultimate, fundamental cause of the activity is
reached.

The action cycle can start from the top, by establishing a new
goal, in which case we call it goal-driven behavior. In this situation, the cycle starts with the goal and then goes through the
three stages of execution. But the action cycle can also start from
the bottom, triggered by some event in the world, in which case we


**42** _The Design of Everyday Things_


call it either data-driven or event-driven behavior. In this situation,
the cycle starts with the environment, the world, and then goes
through the three stages of evaluation.
For many everyday tasks, goals and intentions are not well specified: they are opportunistic rather than planned. Opportunistic
actions are those in which the behavior takes advantage of circumstances. Rather than engage in extensive planning and analysis, we
go about the day’s activities and do things as opportunities arise.
Thus, we may not have planned to try a new café or to ask a question
of a friend. Rather, we go through the day’s activities, and if we find
ourselves near the café or encountering the friend, then we allow the
opportunity to trigger the appropriate activity. Otherwise, we might
never get to that café or ask our friend the question. For crucial
tasks we make special efforts to ensure that they get done. Opportunistic actions are less precise and certain than specified goals and
intentions, but they result in less mental effort, less inconvenience,
and perhaps more interest. Some of us adjust our lives around the
expectation of opportunities. And sometimes, even for goal-driven
behavior, we try to create world events that will ensure that the
sequence gets completed. For example, sometimes when I must do
an important task, I ask someone to set a deadline for me. I use the
approach of that deadline to trigger the work. It may only be a few
hours before the deadline that I actually get to work and do the job,
but the important point is that it does get done. This self-triggering
of external drivers is fully compatible with the seven-stage analysis.
The seven stages provide a guideline for developing new products or services. The gulfs are obvious places to start, for either gulf,
whether of execution or evaluation, is an opportunity for product
enhancement. The trick is to develop observational skills to detect
them. Most innovation is done as an incremental enhancement of

existing products. What about radical ideas, ones that introduce
new product categories to the marketplace? These come about by
reconsidering the goals, and always asking what the real goal is:
what is called the _root cause_ analysis.
Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt
once pointed out, “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill.

They want a quarter-inch hole!” Levitt’s example of the drill implying that the goal is really a hole is only partially correct, however. When people go to a store to buy a drill, that is not their real
goal. But why would anyone want a quarter-inch hole? Clearly
that is an intermediate goal. Perhaps they wanted to hang shelves
on the wall. Levitt stopped too soon.
Once you realize that they don’t really want the drill, you realize
that perhaps they don’t really want the hole, either: they want to
install their bookshelves. Why not develop methods that don’t require holes? Or perhaps books that don’t require bookshelves. (Yes,
I know: electronic books, e-books.)
