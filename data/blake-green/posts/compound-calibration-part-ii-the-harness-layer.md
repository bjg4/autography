AI system performance gains stem primarily from engineering excellence rather than model capabilities alone.

## The Real Performance Driver

Breakthrough experiences come from how models are implemented, not the models themselves. The magic isn't the model. It's how it's wrapped.

## Evidence of Harness Impact

Three concrete examples demonstrate this principle:

1. **CORE-Bench Results**: Opus 4.5 achieved 42% with standard scaffolding but 78% with Claude Code's implementation—an 86% improvement from architectural changes alone.

2. **ARC-AGI-2 Performance**: Poetiq's six-person startup surpassed Google's official Gemini 3 results (54% vs. 45%) using similar underlying models through superior orchestration.

3. **Cursor's Engineering**: Removing reasoning traces caused a 30% performance drop with identical model, demonstrating that "the scaffold is the product."

## The Compounding Advantage

Well-calibrated harness layers automatically extract greater value from new model releases. Rather than debating which model performs best, teams should invest in refinement loops, critique systems, and tool orchestration that persist across model upgrades.

**Conclusion**: Model releases attract attention, but sustainable competitive advantage comes from engineering the harness layer that orchestrates model capabilities.
