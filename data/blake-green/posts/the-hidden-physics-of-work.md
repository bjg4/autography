Conventional workplace advice overlooks how organizations actually function. Rather than assuming rational actors and frictionless communication, three organizational "laws" operate predictably:

## Cunningham's Law: Expertise is Contextual and Reactive

"Ask a room of smart people to explain something, get silence. State confidently how you think it works—even incorrectly—and suddenly everyone has opinions." People are motivated to correct rather than educate. This reveals that organizational expertise exists as reactive pattern recognition, not transferable documentation. Present flawed early versions to stakeholders rather than blank canvases, as corrections reveal what people actually value faster than open-ended feedback.

## Conway's Law: Communication Structure is Product Constraint

Systems mirror their organizations literally. A product fragmented across teams reflects fragmented communication structures. Rather than viewing this as inevitable dysfunction, use this insight diagnostically—recognizing whether product problems stem from technical challenges or structural communication barriers.

## Parkinson's Law: Ambiguity Expands to Available Time

When deadlines are distant and scope unclear, work expands to fill allocated time through meetings, documentation, and scope creep rather than genuine complexity. The solution involves constraining scope upfront and delivering value quickly rather than defaulting to timeline-driven expansion.

## Core Argument

These patterns operate as structural forces regardless of intent. Success requires designing intentionally around them rather than assuming good intentions overcome them.
