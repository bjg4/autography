TradTech approaches innovation by asking "what can we make with what we have?" by opening the fridge. AI-native companies, conversely, close that door and ask "what should we make, knowing the ingredients will change before lunch?"

## The Core Argument

Measure a team's alignment with AI advancement by counting weekly Slack messages linking arXiv papers or model announcements. Zero indicates being trapped in legacy thinking; two to four suggests borderline engagement; five or more means actively shopping for new capabilities.

The fridge represents the seductive trap of existing infrastructure—legacy integrations, vendor "AI modules," and yesterday's contracts stacked into tomorrow's roadmaps. Meanwhile, the ingredient store restocks nightly. When Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.5 in September 2025, platforms like Poe and Perplexity integrated it within hours, while enterprises remained locked in quarterly procurement cycles.

Write the menu first, then continuously rewrite it as conditions change. Real innovation means understanding when to discard yesterday's approach and "go shopping" for what the new recipe demands.

## The Final Philosophy

"Your product isn't what you ship. It's how fast you learn while the ingredients change under your fingernails."
