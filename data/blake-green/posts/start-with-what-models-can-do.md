AI strategy should prioritize deletion over addition. Rather than asking "What can we improve with AI?", organizations should ask "What becomes unnecessary?"

## Key Framework

Three-question decision framework:

1. "What bottleneck created this step?" 
2. "Does AI remove that bottleneck?"
3. "If the constraint is gone, what becomes unnecessary?"

## Real-World Examples

**Cursor**: Eliminated manual file navigation in coding by allowing AI to edit across multiple files simultaneously, removing the scaffolding around the editing process itself.

**Cora**: Streamlined email management by showing only messages requiring replies, automatically archiving others with summaries, thus removing elaborate organizational systems.

## Strategic Guidance

Two approaches:

- **Optimize**: Make existing workflows 30-50% better (safer for established companies with revenue and regulatory constraints)
- **Delete**: Remove unnecessary steps entirely (better for new entrants or adjacent markets)

## Testing Approach

Give capable AI to 3-5 users with a goal and observe what steps they naturally skip. The strongest signal: when users say they "cannot revert" to the old method.

## Core Insight

"The winners won't be whoever deletes the most. They'll be whoever correctly identifies what to delete vs. what to optimize."
