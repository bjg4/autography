## Transcript

David Senra (00:00:02):
I'm ready when you are, man. I'm in the zone. I'm in the zone, man. We're going to pick up right. I hope we start with this. I love your energy. This is what I always tell people when, you know, I did the episode in your book, right? And since then, thousands, and this is not an exaggeration, thousands of people have sent me messages. But what I try to explain to people, they're like, well, what's like so different about Brad? I was like, well, first of all, how long do you have? Second of all, he's got the best energy and the most energy of any person I've ever been around. So I really appreciate you taking the time and agreeing to do this. One of my favorite things is your affinity and relationship that you had.
David Senra (00:00:35):
You had a bunch of mentors, but one of your most important one that you mentioned, I think, four times in the book is Ludwig Jesselson. You have a list of maxims in the very beginning of the book that you learned from other people. The maximum you listed for him was get the major trend right. So if you could just talk about your relationship with him and what he meant to you, I think that's a perfect place to start. He meant a lot. So Mr. Jesselson, I never called him Ludwig. Mr. Jesselson, who's significantly older than me and much more accomplished than me. So I showed him respect by calling him Mr.
David Senra (00:01:05):
Jesselson. Mr. Jesselson was a special guy. This was someone who was deep, very profound, and had lived life fully and by principles. And he was a religious guy. I wouldn't say he was like ultra-religious. He was more taking the morality of Judaism, the do's and don'ts and ethical behavior and honesty and so forth. And that became the core of his life. That became the core of his personal life and his business life. Relationships, deep relationships, long-term relationships, honest relationships, relationships you can keep coming back to.
David Senra (00:01:40):
And sometimes one person has the leverage, sometimes the other person has the leverage. Doesn't matter. You don't take advantage of that. It's long-term relationships. And he had, he had about a few dozen deep principles. And one of them is one you just mentioned, which is, because he was a trader, ran the largest commodity trading firm in the world, Philip Brothers. It was, you got to get the long-term trend right. You can get a lot of this stuff right. Yeah. But if you don't get the long-term trend right, you're kind of in trouble. So you got to figure that one out.
David Senra (00:02:11):
You got to say, what's going on here? You need context. You need to see what's happening, what did happen, what is happening, and what will likely happen in the future. And what are the different future states that could happen, and what's the probabilities for each one of those? And then you have your risk management. So yeah, the converse of that is if you get the major trend wrong, you can do a thousand things right. You're still going to lose. You're not going to create alpha. You're not going to create value there. So yeah, that was a big lesson from him. The other thing that I love is you were 23 years old.
David Senra (00:02:43):
You're having lunch with him on a very frequent basis. Like you just said, he's much older. He's one of the most successful people in the world. He's taking an interest in you. And yet you were still comfortable to like unload your stresses and your problems. And he would sit there patiently listening. And then I love his response where he's like, yeah, business is problems. Like one of the, I think, most important lessons is like problems. There's a line from Henry Kaiser, who was, you know, in his day was as famous as, say, like an Elon is today or You're Becoming. And, you know, he started 100 different companies. He built a Hoover Dam. He built Liberty Ships for the Allies in World War II.
David Senra (00:03:17):
And I read a bunch of biographies on him because he was one of Charlie Munger's favorite founders. And he said a line in the biography that's in multiple life stories about him that problems are just opportunities and work close. And so I read your recounting in your book of some of your lunches with Mr. Jelson. It's like, oh, he had the exact same, he essentially gave you the same advice. Yeah. So in the book, I talked about a specific episode when I was having lunch with him and I was kind of down and glum and what's going on. I was talking about this problem and this thing.
David Senra (00:03:49):
I was just kind of down. And he said, well, don't stay in the business world if you're going to get down on this stuff. This is the things you should get up from. We have problems, we have challenges, you have obstacles. By addressing those, that's how you make money. You make money. So the more problems you have, as long as you can solve them, as long as you figure out how to address them and remove the problem, that's how you're creating value. That's a wonderful way to go through life. Number one, it's a great way to make money because you're not always down because you always have incoming missiles when you're in the business world.
David Senra (00:04:19):
You have problems with employees, with competitors, with regular. I mean, just all day long you have incoming missiles. You have great stuff too, but in between that is punches to the face. And if you're going to get beaten up by that, you're not going to, you're not going to be successful. And secondly, you're not going to be happy. So you're going to go through life like glum. You see, sometimes you see these like multi-billionaire guys and they always look like this. Well, what's the point of all the money? Seriously. So I would not want to be one of these linear guys who's like frowning all the time, like upset and angry and depressed.
David Senra (00:04:54):
That's much more important to me to be in the right frame of mind and to go through the short time we have in life. Happy, reasonably happy. I don't have a perfectionist standard. I have to be like in ecstasy and bliss 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but generally happy. Did you ever meet Sam Zell when he was alive? I did, yeah, many times. Okay. So he's great guy. He had the same thing. I was lucky enough to have a two-hour, very intense lunch with him. He said the same, very similar thing to you. He's just like, I know all the rich guys. He's like, you wouldn't believe how many are miserable. He's like, don't do that. He's like, I wake up every single day.
David Senra (00:05:26):
You guys have a lot of similarity where like, I'll spend time with you. You know, the very first time I met you when I went to your book launch party, right? I just remember like, oh, this guy's got crazy energy. And I'd already read your book by then. But something that you talk about over and over again in your book is like, problems are just opportunities. It reminded me of there's this line from in Jeff Bezos's, there's several books on him, but one of his main biographies is this book called Everything Story, Everything Store. And they said that Jeff, you would tell him problems about his business and he would get excited. Yeah. Because he's like, oh, and he talks about the shareholders.
David Senra (00:05:57):
Like, oh, this is like, these are problems. If I solve these problems, this is going to increase the enterprise value of the company that I'm building. These are actually good things to identify and embrace instead of avoid. One of the most important things that I learned from Brad Jacobs is the importance of working with the smartest and most talented people you can. Brad says the most important thing that a CEO does is recruit superlative people. Brad recruits the smartest people he can find and says there's no substitute for smarts. Steve Jobs believed that this was important too. Steve said, I think that I've consistently figured out who the really smart people were to hang around with.
David Senra (00:06:30):
You must find extraordinary people. The key observation is that in most things in life, the dynamic range between average quality and the best quality is at most two to one. But in the field that I was interested in, I noticed that the dynamic range between what an average person could accomplish and what the best person could accomplish was 50 or 100 to 1. You need to build a team that pursues the A plus players. That is the end of the Steve Jobs quote. And that is exactly what RAMP has done. RAMP has the most talented technical team in their industry.
David Senra (00:07:02):
Becoming an engineer at RAMP is nearly impossible. In the last 12 months, they hired only 0.23% of the people that applied. That means when you use RAMP, you now have top-tier technical talent and some of the best AI engineers working on your behalf 24-7 to automate and improve all of your business's financial operations. And they do this on a single platform. That means the longer they use RAMP, the more efficient your company becomes. This is important because as Sam Walton said in his autobiography, you can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation, or you can be brilliant and still go out of business if you're too inefficient.
David Senra (00:07:39):
RAMP helps you run an efficient organization. From a customer's perspective, what does a team of A-plus players sound like? It sounds like this customer review that I read, which said, RAMP is like having a teammate who you never need to check in on because they have it handled. Go to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business save time and money today. That is ramp.com. I do have a question on your long-term reputation. Okay. So there's this line. Do you remember when Buffett got in all that trouble with Solomon Brothers?
David Senra (00:08:09):
And he's like, listen, you can lose money. That's fine. But you lose a shred of reputation. I'll be ruthless. I'll be absolutely ruthless. It was a very jarring experience for me at your book launch party because first of all, I was the only one that didn't show up in a suit. So I rectified that today, right? And then everybody else was just like, you know, I've known Brad for three decades. Basically, everybody there was like, how do you know Brad? It's like, you know, I was an investor of his. You know, he made all this money for the pension fund that we were on and everything else. And like the stories that I've heard at the party and then since I released the episode is just like, you have a fantastic long-term reputation.
David Senra (00:08:43):
Do you have any advice on how you're able to maintain that and how important it was for other people to do the same thing? Reputation is really important. Your personal brand is extremely important because based on that, people are going to want to do business with you or they're going to want to not do business with you. So every day you're in the office and doing stuff, you're either raising your brand or you're lowering your brand. And that's the main thing you got to work on. You got to make sure that your brand reflects integrity and honesty and dependability and stability and people can count on you. This goes back to Mr.
David Senra (00:09:13):
Jesselson. So Philip Brothers, this is before email. This is before, actually it was even before Faxis. It was more Twixes and Telexes, which took a few days to go through when they went through. So you could do a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars on a handshake or on a phone call. There's no written confirmation of that for like days. In the meantime, maybe the price of whatever you were trading, oil or copper, had gone up a lot. You still had to have a deal. Otherwise, the whole system doesn't work.
David Senra (00:09:43):
So dependability is so, so, trust is so, so important to do. How old were you when you did when he gave you that advice? Did you immediately start playing it? So you were optimizing for the long term, even when you were that young? Yeah. I think as you get older, you optimize long term more, I think. I think when you're young, you're. Just so ambitious and you want to get stuff done, you're in the now. As you get older, as you mature, you have more context. I think life in general is about getting more context, seeing things in proportion to other things. Can you say more about that?
David Senra (00:10:14):
Well, you know, because we've talked about it a lot outside of your podcast, I'm into meditation. So, a lot of the meditation I do is changing, looking at space from different perspectives, not the normal perspective that we have right at this minute. So, I expand my mind from the earth to the sun to the solar system to the galaxy, to the clusters of galaxies, to the universe, to the multiverse. Just go way, way, way, way, way high. And then bring it all the way back in and then go into the molecule and the atom and the proton and the nucleus and right in the middle of all that and then go to strings.
David Senra (00:10:46):
And I find that according, making my mind like an accordion getting really big and then really, really small. And they're doing the same thing with time. Looking at time, go back towards my life over the last few decades, and then go back centuries and millennia and just keep going way, way, way back all the way back 13.8 billion years, go back all the way to the Big Bang, and then go all the way forward and like picture the world going forward, forward, forward, forward, forward. That time and space juxtaposition, for me at least, different things work for different people, gives me context.
David Senra (00:11:17):
It gives me humility, gives me humbleness. It shows that I'm just one thing right here, and I'm a major, major thing going on. I'm just one little tiny jet. At the same time, I'm part of that. So I'm very uplifted. I'm very inspired. I'm very motivated. Like, wow, I'm part of like a real big deal here. It's great. We all are. We're all part of this huge, huge, huge, huge thing. So I think context is really important. It gives you meaning, it gives you purpose. It gives you understanding. It gives you wisdom. I know you hate when I say this, because we've talked about this priorly.
David Senra (00:11:47):
It's like you obviously know I study uncommon people for a living, right? They do a great job at it. I appreciate it. They're unique. Yeah, I appreciate it. But think about how crazy it is. The people that I study on Founders is they were so good at their job, somebody wrote a book about their life. Like you're talking about very small, but most of their inner monologues, you're different. You have a much more positive energy. And like, there's almost like a, let me give you some context here. We were together a few months ago at a mutual friend's birthday party in Miami, our friend Rick. And there's a bunch of interesting people at the party.
David Senra (00:12:19):
One of them was Apollo Ono. Okay, Apollo Ono is the most decorated winter, American Winter Olympian of all time. He's become a friend. I met him through the podcast. And he walks up to me, and there's one of the funniest things. And, you know, because he has people that he's Olympian, like, he was training since he was a kid. His dad would make him get up at like five in the morning and run drills in the school parking lot. But he still comes from like a very positive, he has a great relationship with his dad. Normally, it's like, you know, not good when they're put in those circumstances. So he was asking me, he's just like, I see this pattern in, you know, when you're reading all these hundreds of biographies about these great entrepreneurs, that like there is something inside of them driving them and is actually negative.
David Senra (00:12:57):
It could be insecurity, it could be, you know, they grew up in poverty, it could be a bad relationship with their family. And he's like, are they all like that? And I, and you're like 20 feet away, you see that guy over there? You go, I go, you know who that is? And he goes, no, I go, that's Brad fucking Jacobs. I was like, I guarantee you, he's not driven by that. This is what I mean. You're uncommon amongst uncommon people because at least from the outside in the conversation I had, it's like, I think part of this impenetrable nature that you have in like, oh, yeah, business is problems. It's going to come. What do you think we're doing here?
David Senra (00:13:28):
Like, you don't seem to be rattled by them. So, like, what is your inner monologue like when like you're doing huge fucking deals right now? You're doing all kinds of crazy stuff. You built eight separate billion dollar companies. You don't do that by accident. So how do you make, like, I'll stop talking there. What is your inner monologue like? So it goes back to what Ms. Justin used to say: is problems are your friend. You don't want to just tolerate problems. You want to embrace problems. You want to hug problems. Problems are the way you succeed. You want to run to the fire. You don't want to run away from the fire.
David Senra (00:13:59):
Be brave. We'll be courageous. Go into it. I think you can start with anything that's anything. And in this case, in Apollo's case, he starts with, and other people he's studied start with, negativity, trauma, stress, insecurity, fear, anxiety. And then that's their motivator. They zero in on that, and then that makes them run faster. Was that ever your case? No, that's not my case. You're like a unicorn. So I don't know that I'm a unicorn. I don't embrace negativity. I'm okay with it, but I don't make a big deal about negativity.
David Senra (00:14:32):
I'd much rather enjoy the positivity. I'm a sunny slide up guy. But your inner monologue, are you nice to yourself? Your ongoing inner monologue. I'm reasonably nice. Yeah, I am. I am vicious. I sound like, you know, David Goggins'. Oh, yeah. I was just, someone was talking. Odds. Yeah, my inner monologue. My inner monologue sounds like David Goggins. Where it's just like, you're not doing enough. This wasn't good enough. Like, I see the problems, so like, I attack them. Like, it's like, oh, like, I'll listen to like a past podcast or something, anything I've done.
David Senra (00:15:04):
It's like, and all I see are the flaws. I don't see any of the good part. So let me comment on that. I think there's two different ways you can approach that. So yes, as cognitive behavior therapy has taught everyone, we're born with a schema, a prism through which we see life. And that can be clouded by core, core beliefs of I'm inadequate, I'm weak, I'm defective, I'm unattractive, I'm unlovable, all kinds of negative stuff. Now, there's two ways you can approach on that. You can either dispute those things, first validate, then dispute.
David Senra (00:15:39):
So say, well, of course I'm hearing this. I have executives who report to me over the years that have the exact same schema as you just described, where they're always saying, oh, I'm no good at this. Oh, when people realize how bad I am, I'm just faking it. I'm wearing this mask, and I'm doing a bad job. I'm going to get fired. People are hiding stuff against me because they don't respect me. All this like negative self-talk. It's a complete waste of time. But nevertheless, that's the reality. The reality is they have this steady drone of automatic negative thoughts.
David Senra (00:16:09):
There's two ways to deal with that. Either you can dispute them, but first validate it. Don't start with the disputing. First, validate and say, okay, yeah, of course I'm having all these negative thoughts because I got a tough job, for example. I have a big job. There's a lot of pressure. And I'm not perfect, so I'm not getting everything right. And so I do mess stuff up, and I do get things wrong, and all that negative talk, and then you catastrophize on those negative things and make them into huge, huge issues when they really should be minimized if you put them in proper context. So you first validate it, but then dispute it.
David Senra (00:16:42):
And then say, well, what does the evidence say here? Is this really a rational thought? Or is this my schema kicking it? To me, when you say that, it's like, I think you have this gift to step outside of yourself, which now you're saying, but when I say you step outside of yourself, you're like, no, I'm in myself. I much prefer to be in myself. Not myself. I like to come to center. I like to find the center. The first time that concept of centering came about was when I was, I went to enrichment camp at school in the summertime. And there was a book they gave out called On Centering.
David Senra (00:17:15):
I don't remember who wrote it. And it had a picture of someone making pottery. And they were explaining in the book that it's all about finding the center of the pot you're making. So centering, finding that inner calmness, finding that zone where you're in the groove. And everybody has it. Everybody has that. You just got to find it. And that's one of life's missions is to find that center, find that inner calmness zone. And then when I went to college and I studied music under Bill Dixon, same concept came out. I said, oh, I'm familiar. They said, come back to the center.
David Senra (00:17:45):
So we're playing improvisation, what he called black music. Some people might call it jazz. He didn't like the word jazz. Playing with some friends, and then you have to find the center. Come back to center, back to the center, back to the center. So there'd be a center point in the music. You could go anywhere you wanted in the music. You can improvise all over the place, but come back to center. And then everybody come back to their common center. So I've incorporated this concept of centering, of finding a center into my meditation practices, into my business practices, into my philosophy of life.
David Senra (00:18:16):
So I like to find centers. But going back to what we were saying before, so you have this negative self-taught coming. You can either take one of two paths. You can take the path of validating and disputing it and seeing it in a proper, rational way, or you can take the approach of just witnessing it, just enjoying it, and just, it is what it is. It's mindful acceptance of it. So acceptance of that. And I vacillate between those two. Sometimes I do the, you asked how I do it. My internal monologue, if negativity creeps in, of course it creeps in.
David Senra (00:18:49):
I'm dancing with the ghosts of my ancestors just the way you and everybody else have danced with the ghosts of the ancestors. Evolution works very slowly over generations, over long periods of time. So we always have the set of genes that were good for survival and procreation of our ancestors, but not necessarily now. We still have in the gene pool all these like irrational thoughts. So another way to look at it is just observe it, kind of more of a Buddhist way. Just observe it. One of the ways, the most simplest Buddhist meditation is just observe your breath.
David Senra (00:19:21):
Observe your breath. I mean, how easy can that be? All you got to do is... We just did this before we started recording. Let's go through a miniature meditation before we begin. I don't ever do that. And I probably should start doing it. I just kind of wake up and go and just try to attack things that I feel like. And don't get me wrong. Like, I absolutely, I'm obsessed with what I do. I love, I love my work. I work on it seven days a week, but I wanted to be the best in the world at it. And that's where it's like, oh, you just see these deficiencies. So that sounds to me like perfectionism. So I suffered a lot from perfectionism when I was younger.
David Senra (00:19:53):
I wanted to be perfect. Not only did I want to be perfect, I wanted everybody else to be perfect. Not only did I want... Myself and others to be perfect. I wanted this universe to be perfect. Everything just goes swimmingly well at my beck and call and command. Well, it turns out that's not reality. None of those three constituents are perfect. There's something that you said in your book. It's actually in this section that I was writing down. You're like, I'm not surprised when things don't go perfectly. That's the nature of the universe. The big problems can be where the best opportunities lie. And so obviously, you know, like anytime I read something, it's not that I'm reading it.
David Senra (00:20:25):
I think about how it relates to every single thing else I've experienced and all the other books I read. And I remember I got to have dinner with Charlie Munger. I spent three hours with him, you know, six months, eight months before he died. There's like a trend here, unfortunately, where it's like you're like, I don't know. I don't know if I'm going to have dinner with you. But one of the things I loved, it was a top note I left myself because as soon as I left there, I just wrote down what I learned. And it said that Charlie has an almost complete indifference to problems. Troubles from time to time should be expected.
David Senra (00:20:56):
This is inescapable, so why let it bother you? And it's like one of the things I most admire about him. He's like, yeah, it's part of life. What's wrong with you? Like, you know, he had 10 decades of life experience. He was way further down the line and obviously way wiser than I was. I have two comments on that. One is when you go back to the Big Bang, the current construct model of how the universe was created, it was actually created out of imperfection. There was like a slight imbalance between matter and anti-matter. Just a slight imbalance. A lot of debate of what caused that.
David Senra (00:21:27):
As a result of that, everything came out of that. Had there been perfection at the beginning of the universe, the Big Bang would not have happened. So we are imperfection. We are the children of imperfection. Imperfection is good. Imperfection is not bad. Expecting perfection will cause you stress and strain. It won't really work. When you were in your 20s, so you said, hey, I wanted to be perfect. Now I do want to be perfect. I want everybody around me to be perfect. I wanted the universe to be perfect. Like, how long did it take for you to learn what you just explained? When I stepped down from United Rentals, as CE, I still stayed as chairman.
David Senra (00:22:00):
When I stepped down as CEO of United Rentals, I'd done it for about 10 years, and I wanted to do my next big thing. I wanted to another startup from the beginning. I was running a big company. I wanted to start it from scratch. And there was a period of a couple of years where I was trying to figure out what I was going to do. And I didn't find it. And then the great financial crisis came and was kind of lost. That was kind of, it's kind of, it was probably the only time in my life that I was depressed. I'm just not depressed. But that period of time, I was actually clinically depressed.
David Senra (00:22:30):
I took the Beck depression inventory and I came out, yep, depressed. Wow. So I found an amazing cognitive therapist, and I went to the guy twice a week, hour and a half a shot for two years. It was fantastic. One of the best things I've ever done in my life because what we did was, in an environment that was very safe and confidential and trusting with someone who was a professional at psychology, I was able to, first of all, identify and then notice more fully my automatic thoughts, the negative thoughts, and irrational thoughts, unconstructive thoughts, and then first validate them, then dispute them, first join, and then lead to a more constructive way of looking at things.
David Senra (00:23:13):
So that cognitive therapy approach of identifying the thoughts and then dealing with them really was the turning point in my life on this perfection thing. Because after a few sessions, he said, you know, I kind of know what's going on here now. I've gotten your measure. You want to hear it? I said, yeah, I want to hear it. And he said, you're suffering from perfectionism. You want everything to be perfect. And it ain't. So we need to get over that. We need to reduce these demands, these musts, these shoulds, these commands that either I or you or the rest of the world is perfect to, you know, preferences where I would like me to be better.
David Senra (00:23:53):
I would like you to be better. I'd like things to go better, but they don't have to. I can still be happy. And frankly, they're not going to all the time. So I need to accept that. I need to radically accept that. I need to be in reality, not put these, you know, Jeff, you mentioned Bezos. Bezos says a lot of cool stuff. One of the things he says often is: don't fight with reality because reality always wins. So the reality of this is nothing's perfect. Like literally nothing is perfect that I found yet. He has another line I think that's related. It's similar to the idea in your book where he's just like, if you don't want to be criticized, you don't want stress and you don't do anything.
David Senra (00:24:27):
Exactly. It's just like, then just sit in a room and watch Netflix and order a DoorDash or something, but like you're not going to do anything that you can be proud of. So that's another irrational thought you see people have. And I used to have this a lot. I don't have it now because I went through that therapy thing and it turned a switch on in my brain. Is a demand that everybody likes me and everybody respects me and everybody says great stuff about me and I get good press and I get good reviews and the stock just goes up every single day. Well, that's not going to happen. That's all perfectionism. That's not reality.
David Senra (00:24:58):
So you just kind of modify that to, well, sure, like everybody else, I'd like people to say good stuff about me rather than bad stuff about me, but I don't really care. If people say bad stuff about me, then okay, maybe there's some truth in it. Maybe it's some good thing I can learn from that. Or maybe they're just off and they don't know me and they're just kind of doing they're imposing their distortions on me. But does that really change who I am? It really doesn't. If somebody is saying something bad about me or is that, does that really matter? It doesn't matter really at core. And again, it goes back to context.
David Senra (00:25:29):
In the larger context of things, most problems really don't matter. They just don't matter. Maybe at the time they seem like one, and maybe we're kicking in, magnifying those problems and catastrophes, making them into big catastrophes and dramas, but most problems really aren't a bad problem, on a bad thing. I always say opportunity is a strange beast. It frequently appears after a loss. There's always a play. There's always, no matter what happens, it goes back to the Justice Link conversation. No matter what gets thrown in your face, at the moment it may seem ugly and bad.
David Senra (00:26:04):
There's a play. There's a way to utilize that. There's a way to use that. There's a way to embrace that and turn that into success. Anything can be turned into positivity and success, even if it starts in a bad place. Something came to mind when you were talking that's also unusual because most of the people that I read biography spell, they go through several different companies till they find their life's work. But normally they're working on something for like a very long time. Why do you keep starting so many companies? Like what is going on? That's my thing.
David Senra (00:26:35):
Everybody's got their thing. So everybody, so you're a great podcaster. You have a talent. Your superpower is you can consume a large amount of information and then distill it down to like, boom, here are the most important takeaways from that. It's really brilliant. That's your thing. That's why you're doing it, right? That's what you're good at. You're not playing professional baseball or acting or singing or whatever. You're doing what you're good at. This is what I'm good at. I'm good at figuring out what's the right industry to consolidate. And secondly, I have a toolkit, and it's the same old toolkit.
David Senra (00:27:05):
It's not. You told me this last time. Can you explain this? I love the way you describe this toolkit of how you approach building your businesses. So first I find the right industry. I find something that's large. I find something that's growing. I find something where it's fragmented. I find something where we can buy things at reasonable prices. I find things where technology could be used. It's not a very tech-forward industry. I find stuff that AI and automation are not going to disrupt anytime in the near future. So I find industries that have certain characteristics to it, whether it was garbage, whether it was construction, whether it was transportation or logistics and now distribution.
David Senra (00:27:42):
They all have the same characteristics, same traits. So that's point number one. Point number two is I then put together an amazing team. I put together a team of people who are generally smarter than me and who are more talented than me in what they do. So I have a great CHRO who knows everything there is to know about HR and compensation and talent recruitment and so forth. I have great MA team who really know how to do deals and get deals done rather than turn them into dramas. I have great finance accounting people who understand everything there is to know agency about running a fast-growing company, keeping the books clean.
David Senra (00:28:18):
So, et cetera. And I get the team together. Then I get the compensation sorted out. So I make everybody my partner on the senior team. And I give people tons of equity, but there's a catch. It could vest, but you can't sell it for five years. And most of it invests in the last two years. So everyone is committed going back to long-term relationships. Sure, people come and go for whatever personal reasons or people burn out or whatever. But generally speaking, most of the team stays for a while. And you work together as a team. And then I have, I have certain rules of how we're going to interact with each other in a very respectful way, but in a way that encourages looking at things from different angles.
David Senra (00:28:58):
So we disagree and we argue. Argue is too strong of a word. We present different ways of looking at a situation that partly overlap and partly conflict. And then we, in a very scientific way, figure out, well, let's risk adjust these things and figure out what's right. It's a scientific experiment, an ongoing science experiment, like all day long of trial and error and experimentation and A-B experimenting. And so that culture that we create gives us a power. It gives us a power to attack the industry in a way without all the noise that a management team has.
David Senra (00:29:33):
A very coherent team, like a super organism, like a brain, like a very organized group. And then I have, between all those people, we have experience at our main job, which is to buy companies at reasonable prices, where there's a difference between what we can raise capital at and what we can deploy it at. And then we have a skill set to be able to improve the companies that we buy. These are the two main things we're good at. Buying companies in a disciplined way. Price is too high, we don't do it.
David Senra (00:30:03):
Price is reasonable, doesn't have to be cheap. We're not trying to steal companies. If price is reasonable, we go for it with gusto. And secondly, the other talent that the team collectively has is we know how to improve the businesses. We know how to improve the pricing, improve the procurement, the HR element, the compensation systems, the technology, the whole tech stack, just everything from A to Z. We're just good at transformation. We're good at taking a company that is making a billion dollars of EBITDA of profit and within three to five years, doubling the profit, doubling the EBITDA.
David Senra (00:30:36):
That's the main criteria I look at when I look at a company is purchase price. And secondly, can we double the profit in three to five years? And most of my main acquisitions, I've done that. So Conway, Robert Dr. Sangla, all these different ones. They were great companies, and everyone says, oh, they're working really well. Okay, well, three years later, we double the profit. Because we apply the toolkit. We apply the playbook. And it's the same playbook, industry after industry. The playbook gets refined a little bit here and there, but it's the same playbook. So when you say, this is just what I do, like to me, you now have figured out who you are as a person, right?
David Senra (00:31:11):
I have this weird theory that I can't, I can't prove, but I believe. And, you know, there's like this myth of like the genius young entrepreneur. And I was like, well, I don't know. If you study, like, you study the history of entrepreneurship pretty intensely, you realize that like people do most of the time their best work many decades into their career. And so there's all kinds of reasons. They're like, oh, they've had more experience. They're wiser. They have more resources. They have more practice. And I don't dispute that. That is all true. But I have this weird theory that they also know themselves way better.
David Senra (00:31:42):
And I think the key to being a great entrepreneur is building a business that's, I used to say building a business that's authentic to you. And then I read Michael Dell's excellent autobiography. And he has a better line. He said, he built a business that's natural to him. And there's a great story. I want your opinion on this in one second, but there's a great story where, you know, Michael starts in his company, he was 19. He's in his 20s and it's doing fabulously well, but he realized like, hey, I need some like grown up, like some, I need some help here. And so he gets this guy, I think his name is Lee Walker, if I remember correctly. And he's about 20 years older than Michael, already started a bunch of companies, rich, you know, didn't have to work anymore, but he saw an unusual once-in-a-generation talent, and Michael decides to help him.
David Senra (00:32:23):
He lasts like four years. And so I read the book and then as I'm about to make the podcast on it, I go and see us. I wonder whatever happened to this guy. And I found an interview that he did, and he's in his 80s. And he's talking about that time. And he gave me some of the best context to really understand this story. And Michael's story is really a story of you and everybody. And all the people really are, you know, very similar people that we're studying. And he's just like, you know, Michael starts his company with $1,000 just. I'm going to take on IBM for my dorm room. IBM is the most valuable company in the world at the time, which I didn't know. It was the first company to hit $100 billion market cap, which is nuts.
David Senra (00:32:56):
And he's, you know, just the audacity to have that. And he's like, in the first few years, like, we're going against this behemoth. And I lasted four years. I started losing my hair. My back hurts. I can't sleep. I'm unhealthy. And he goes, but he goes, but Michael was energized by it. He built a business that was natural to him because this is what I want to do. I'm not losing my hair. I'm not depressed. My back's not hurting. I can't sleep. I'm like waking up every day, just getting after it. So is that the way you feel about just like what you're doing?
David Senra (00:33:27):
It's like, this is, it may seem weird because it is not a pejorative way. It's not weird in a negative way. I don't know another person that started eight separate billion dollar companies. So it's like almost like you can't help. That's what I do. And that's, I know how to do that. So it's just natural to you. This is just like. Yeah. This is this is, I mean, I've done it many times before. And I've made every mistake in the book over the decades. And I've learned from those mistakes. And I've refined it and refined it. But I have a winning formula. I know how to execute on this. And the team I have knows how to execute on it.
David Senra (00:33:58):
I don't want to underestimate the team. So one of the things about being the CEO and the founders, you get all the credit. But like, there's a lot of people on the team who are doing these things, accomplishing these things. Yeah, you have a great line in your book, which I see over and over again. You said the CEO's most important job is recruiting superlative people. Totally. It's like you're totally correct. So my question to you, though, is like, what would it take to get you to stop? Yeah, I don't know. I don't see that in my near future. I just started the company in the last few months. This is what I, no, but in general, like, so this is what I loved about, you know, most of the people I admire.
David Senra (00:34:32):
It's like, I can still remember this. You know, I put it into the maximum. It's like, if you love what you do, your extra strategy is death, right? Like, we're on something. So like, you know, Sam Zell told me, he's like, I'm going to be doing deals till I died. Well, he was doing deals till he died. Munger, same thing. Like, I met him right after the Silicon Valley bank collapse. It was like, he was like a kid in a candy shop. He just thought this was like the, he didn't want people to be hurt, obviously. But he's just like, you know how many financial panics that I've seen in my lifetime? Like, of course, this is like nothing new.
David Senra (00:35:03):
So I remember I was actually having dinner. I remember where it was. I was at Harry's Pizzeria in Miami in the design district. And, you know, I was supposed to be paying attention to my wife and on our date. And I was thinking about the podcast and all the shit I'm reading. And I go and like take a bite into a piece of pizza. And I was like, people say if you love what you do, you do it for free. And I go, no, there's a different level. If you loved what you do, they couldn't pay you to stop. There you go. And I was like, how much money could you have gone to Steve Jobs?
David Senra (00:35:34):
Like, hey, how much would it take for you to not work on Apple? That's not why he's doing it. That's not why they're doing it. And Enzo Ferrari, Estee Lauder, Edwin Land, Coco Chanel, all these other people. Like, they just can't. Michael Ferrero, I just, the Michelin brothers, like, there's this story over and over again. I get the same sense to you. It's just like, if I said, hey, what price I'm going to pay you? And you can't do any work. You have to stay home. You can't work. It's just like, there's no price. Everyone you just named all those successful people, they were all in. They were 100% in.
David Senra (00:36:04):
They weren't like partly in and partly aren't. They're in. They're 100% in and completely focused and single-mindedly concentrated on executing the plan. And that's important. And you want to have people on your team who share that passion, that commitment. The best leaders in business are able to spot patterns, but you can't spot patterns if you can't see your data. And most businesses are only using 20% of their data because 80% of your customer intelligence is invisible, hidden in emails, transcripts, and conversations.
David Senra (00:36:35):
Unless you have HubSpot. HubSpot is where all of your data comes together so you can see the patterns that matter. Because when you know more, you grow more. And that is a pattern that never fails. Visit hubspot.com today. That is hubspot.com. That leads me to another great one of your, I don't even think you think it's a maxim, but it's how you differentiate between A, B, and C players, where you're like, I'm just going to summarize this and jump in whenever you want, but you envision, you do another thought experiment of, okay, do you want to see if you have the absolute best people on your team?
David Senra (00:37:09):
Just visualize that they're coming into your office and they're saying, Brad, I quit. So then what happens next in this scenario? So I'm always interacting with my CHRO and going over talent and making sure everybody's happy and motivated. How much percent of your, like... A lot. I spend most of my time on people and talent issues. So most of your time. Well, no, no, not the most, but the most, if I did a pie chart of like how I divide up my time, the largest percent is on people issues. There's a funny story about this.
David Senra (00:37:40):
And I don't want to interrupt, but I do, this is inside of me and it just has to come out all these stories because I find them fascinating. So there's two MBA students in Stanford in the 90s and late 90s. And in 97, they interview 16 technology company founders since they're in Silicon Valley at the time, you know, and they publish this book called In the Company of Giants. And everybody's in there, you know, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and everybody else. And they're telling Steve, they're like, well, you know, you're the founder. Of course, you don't have time to, you know, recruit people.
David Senra (00:38:10):
And Steve's like, what? Like, no, it's the most, it sounds exactly what you said in your book. It's the most important. He goes, and he did the great way to demonstrate the point. He goes, let's say you're starting a company, right? You're in Silicon Valley. That's what you're doing over here. You pick your co-founder. You should think long and hard about that. Your co-founder is 50% of the company at that point. And then he goes, and then he goes, but you still goes out. Now you have to pick the 10th person. That person's 10% of your company. And you're saying you don't have time? Like, what else are you doing? It's all about the people. It's all about the people. You know, systems and tech and budgets and customers and sales, all these things are really, really important.
David Senra (00:38:47):
But you can't achieve excellence in those things without fantastic people, without fantastic leaders. And I spend a lot of time, especially on the top few dozen people. I want to make sure everybody's in it to win it. Everybody is fully, fully engaged. And I do a mental exercise where I picture the person coming into my office and saying, Brad, I quit. Like, this is not a conversation about you making me a counteroffer. I'm done. I've already moved. It's over with. This is about a conversation about how do we make an orderly transition because I respect you and I don't want to leave you high and dry. And then I try to feel and visualize what would be my reaction if that person came into me and quit.
David Senra (00:39:24):
If my reaction to that is, yes, I don't want to smile. I don't want to act like I'm happy about this. But I didn't have, you know, nobody likes firing people. And I just didn't, you know, I just kept postponing firing that person. I shouldn't have, but I did. And this is great. I don't have to pay severance. And, you know, that solves that problem. No problem at all. We'll replace them. That's a C player. That's someone really, you should get the courage up to get off the management, get off the team right away. And then on the second category, if my reaction to it is, you know, it kind of sucks.
David Senra (00:39:58):
You know, it's. What I would have preferred that person stayed. But it's not the end of the world. We'll hire a headhunter. We'll get someone as good, maybe some even better. And, you know, things will work out. That's a B player. But if when I visualize that person quitting, my reaction to that is pure terror and absolute panic. And like somebody took a baseball bat and just whacked me in the stomach and then punched me in the face. I'm like, oh my God. Like I'm never going to find someone as good as her. No way. Or I'm never going to have someone as talented as that person.
David Senra (00:40:31):
I'm never going to have someone who brings to the table their particular superpower. And I can't even hear what they're saying anymore. So I'm just like having this internal panic dialogue going on. That's what you call an A player. So I want all A players around me. I want people whose relationship with me I value so much that if it was terminated, I would be lost. And I want them to feel the same way. I want to have mutual relationships. I want people who love being in a relationship with the team, with the company, and that we all are in it together to go conquer the world.
David Senra (00:41:06):
I think I had named it. It's been two years since I wrote the book, but I think I had a chapter that said how to kill the competition instead of killing each other. And that's, you know, it's kind of funny, but it's a serious, it's a serious title. You don't want to have a dysfunctional management team. One of the most important things that has allowed us to create tens and tens of billions of dollars of value is the management team's coherent. We have the right people on the management team, and we have the rules of the road of how we're going to deal with each other in a respectful way that still encourages differences of opinion.
David Senra (00:41:38):
First of all, I love the way you described because everybody says, oh, yeah, hire A players. It's really hard to differentiate. Like, what does that actually mean? And I think this thought experiment is perfect. It's like, we are fucked. If this person leaves, that's an A player. That's a way to think about this. But this also goes down to your gift and why I think I've learned so much from you. One partially, it's like your ability to have very clear thinking and then put it in a memorable way. So you were just talking about like the relationships that you have with the people you work for. You have a line in the book where you're like, he says, an organization is like a party.
David Senra (00:42:11):
You only want to invite people who bring the vibe up. My team and I spend a lot of time together, so it's a big deal that we like one another. Yeah, I agree with that. Who said that? That was a good one. Bezos has a line, and I think his shareholder letters is like, life is too short to work with people you don't admire. Like it's same situation. It's like you're in charge. You get to choose, again, this goes back to one of the gifts of being the CEO, of being an entrepreneur. It's like it's very rare that you get to literally choose who has access to, who's around you. And I love this idea. It's like, hey, the organization is just like a party. You want people to, you only want people to break up the value.
David Senra (00:42:43):
It's all about the people. It's all about the people because the people then create all the different processes and work streams and transformations and everything. This is very fascinating because it's obviously, you know, business is people, right? You're not just like the people that are building the product, but like all the businesses, the best of the definition of business I've ever heard actually came from Richard Branson. He says, all businesses is an idea that makes somebody else's life better, right? And like there's infinite, that's why there's always more opportunity because there's infinite ways. We think technology is going to like, it changes things, but then it just usually opens up other ways to make other people's lives better.
David Senra (00:43:16):
So just focus on like, if you're looking for an opportunity, how can I just serve other people? Another line that's very related to this is Henry Ford, where he says money comes naturally as a result of service. Like I think those two ideas go together. The reason I was thinking about this though, the best way I just I've heard describe what you were just saying. It's all about people work with the best people you possibly can, the A players. We're going to talk about, you have this great line about there's no substitute for brains. But before that, it's like the way that I've heard this described best, in my opinion, is from Ed Catmull, the founder of Pixar, right?
David Senra (00:43:49):
He would go around and give all these talks. And he was actually like shocked that he would ask the audience, like, what's more important? People are ideas. He says, every single time people got it wrong, they said it was the ideas. And he's like, no, it's the people. And so he has this great line where he's like, listen, if you give a mediocre idea, right, to a brilliant team, they're either going to fix it or they'll throw it out and come up with something better, something new. But if you give a great idea to a mediocre team, they're going to screw it up. So it's obviously, because ideas come from people, so it's the people.
David Senra (00:44:19):
So that's exactly what I'm trying to say. Well, what he said. He says it in like just a great way, but you have a very explicit piece of advice in your book that I think is interesting, where you're like, screening for, there's no substitute for brains. Screening for superior intelligence eliminates 90% of all candidates. So it's the first thing I look at. There's no substitute for smarts. The CEO trait most closely correlated with organizational success is a high IQ. Double down on hiring the brightest. Yeah. Well, you want smart people. And I particularly want people who are smarter than me.
David Senra (00:44:50):
I want people who uplift me, who teach me. I don't want to be. Do you want them specialized? Because you mentioned earlier, you said you want them smarter than you, but also better at their particular. The vast majority of them are specialized. Okay. They're a finance person. They're an investor person. They're a strategic person. They have something that they bring, a tech person, they bring to the table that they're really an inch wide, a mile deep. But you also want them to have certain human qualities that transcend what their specialty is. And those are as or more important than the technical skills.
David Senra (00:45:23):
Explain. Well, you want to mention smart. You want people who are honest. You want people who are hardworking. You want people who are collegial. You want people who are really in it. Like on the work-life balance thing, and boom, it's work. And their life is a lot of their work. And they enjoy that. And I don't have to hold them like a school teacher or stick over their head getting them to work late or coming to early work on weekends. Like they want to do that. Like they enjoy doing that. Their job, their career, their success, the collective success of the company is an important part of their gestures. It's really important part of their being and their purpose.
David Senra (00:45:54):
Was there ever a time, I don't mean you can interrupt me, but this is fascinating. And it's almost selfish to have this conversation because I get to ask you questions and learn from you. Was there ever a time where work wasn't where you were more balanced? When was the last time you were balanced? So you started your first company at 23. I did, and I've been completely imbalanced since then. I've been working seven days a week. Yeah, because you have a few vacations. You scaled like four years to, I don't know, a couple billion dollars. It was just an insane story. But for me, it's not work. For me, it's like, I'm really enjoying it. To me, it's a craft. It's a skill that I have.
David Senra (00:46:24):
And I enjoy doing it. Were you always honest with yourself that it was the top priority? I think so. Yeah. I said honestly. I had a conversation with a friend of mine on the drive over here. And I think I'm lying to myself. So let me give you an example. So, you know, in many cases, like you read these biographies of these people and it winds up being a cautionary tale, you know, because they kind of like will sacrifice everything for professional success, their health, their relationships, everything else. Well, that I'm not in favor of. No, no, no. You're still married. You're a good father. You're like everything else. Yeah, for sure.
David Senra (00:46:55):
But your main, it's not like you have a bunch of abundance of hobbies outside of work, from what I understand. Meditation and music. That's pretty much it. There you go. So for a long time, every single person I read about, I was like, okay, well, I even titled the episode My Personal Blueprint, which was Ed Thorpe, right? Ed Thorpe, I'll give a short run now where Craig first person to invent a quantitative hedge fund. He invented the ability to count cards for Blackjack, writes this book in the 1960s called Beat a Dealer, made more money than he'll ever spend.
David Senra (00:47:27):
But if you read his book, you get to the end. It's like he was much more balanced, right? He also came from academia and maybe this had played a role into that. But essentially, like lived a life of adventure because he truly loved what he did. Once he made more money than he could spend, he stopped trading more time for money. He had a good marriage until his wife passed away from cancer, took care of his health. But like much more of like a, let's say there's five important things and he kind of like divvied up. Maybe work was 50%, but the other four are other 50%.
David Senra (00:48:00):
And I was like, oh, that's kind of my personal blueprint. And I said on the driver, I go, no, I'm lying. It's like 90% of what I think about and how I spend my time is just work. That's a beautiful thing. So all the people you've mentioned so far, all these very, very successful people. I guarantee you, probably every single one of them, with few exceptions, if any, were all in. And what they were doing was their passion, and they were just so excited about it. They were in the flow. They were in the flow of being so absorbed on something that you lose track of time and the whole rest of the universe is gone.
David Senra (00:48:34):
You're just in it. You're just really into something that you do well and you're with people that you really like. And you're likely to be successful because you're doing what you do. When I was thinking about the amount of research that you do that you explain before you get into an industry, before you start a company, it's like, the way I describe your book is buy it, read it all the way through. And then what I really think it is, you put it close to your desk because it's a reference manual. Because you can just pick this up now and read one chapter that takes 10 minutes and get good ideas out of it.
David Senra (00:49:04):
Do you know I'm writing a sequel? Last time you told me, he's like, I only had one book in me. I have nothing else. So I wrote the book and I got so much feedback of what people thought about it. And people asked, well, you should really talk more about this, this. At first, I said, I'm never writing another book. Yes, I will. It takes a lot of time to write a book. And I don't have a lot of time. But I had so many people ask me similar questions. Okay, I'm going to write a sequel that addresses those particular questions. You know what the title is going to be? That was How to Make a Few Billion Dollars. This was going to be called How to Make a Few More Billion Dollars. That cradle one. Let me get an early copy, please.
David Senra (00:49:36):
You're very nice to send me an early copy of this one. But I think what ties all this together, when I think about your research process, the way you go after life, all the people we've been talking about from Steve Jobs to Jeff Bezos, this is like mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it. Love it. I think that is what animates me. It's just like you see this. You're talking about like even when you buy great companies, good companies, so like, what else could you do? It's like, there's. Always more because you could always infuse passion into what you're doing, obsession, work with the best people. Of course, you can keep getting better and better results.
David Senra (00:50:07):
Yeah. Well, I agree with that. I think, so what you just said, you buy a company, it's doing very well, and then three, four years later, you've doubled the profit of it. What did you do? You went in with a toolkit and you went into the attack the pricing using algorithms and elasticity analysis. You've tacked the compensation, so you've got the salespeople made partners rather than pupils to the parent authoritarian figure at corporate. You put in technology that frees up time that allows people to spend time doing selling and doing their job rather than trying to find information.
David Senra (00:50:41):
You're sharing information in very good ways. So you apply a certain toolkit, boom, you double profit. So wait a minute. This brings up something interesting that I've been talking about lately, the different archetypes there is in founders and CEOs, right? Everybody thinks like, oh, there's kind of one archetype, and especially the ones that are popularized now, it's like essentially like the Steve Jobs dictator make almost all the decisions. I don't like that. Yeah, so exactly. I just heard the pupil part. So who am I to criticize Steve Challenge? No, no, no, no. It's not a criticism. It's just like, that's the beauty of entrepreneurship. It's like, you get to do it. I wouldn't be able to do that. So what is your archetype?
David Senra (00:51:11):
What is like, let me back up before I ask you a question, because I've been having long conversations with Daniel Eck, the founder of Spotify, who's become a good friend. And that's his whole thing. Where we're actually might be writing something together about, like, he's concerned that there's going to be young entrepreneurs out there that are like, I'm not like Elon, or I'm not like Steve, or I'm not like all these people, so therefore I can't be an entrepreneur. He's like, there's multiple archetypes. He's like, I'm not like that. He says he thinks he's a better coach than he is a player. And essentially, he has discovered, it's almost like this. He recruits some of the best talent in the world to the point where he's like, I used to be the best at product.
David Senra (00:51:45):
That guy's better at product. He should do it. That guy's a better designer. That guy, that person's a better HR. That person's everything. So he's like, the way I look at it is like much more of a coach than a player. What is your archetype? So you want to get the right people in place. You want to get the compensation aligned. And then you want to be communicating with each other in a very constructive way in a very prolific way. So Friday, we had our second MOR, monthly operating review for this company we'd bought, Beacon. And how did we come up with the agenda?
David Senra (00:52:16):
It was a 10-hour meeting, two breaks. One was 10 minutes, one was five minutes. Nobody was distracted. Nobody's on phones or devices. It was all shut off. We're very concentrating on the one person that had the proverbial microphone at a time and listening very carefully and intently of what that person was saying and then debating each point and each action point. How did we come up with the agenda? Here's how. Did I, the CEO, come from above and say, here's the agenda that I think is an important thing. I'm smarter than all of you, and here's what we should be doing. No.
David Senra (00:52:47):
How pompous and arrogant and kind of ineffective really to do that. What I do is just the opposite. I send around a question pro an app and we say, here's all the materials pre-read for the meeting. We don't do PowerPoints and go through all that nonsense where everyone tells each other how great they're doing. It's just the silliness that you see a lot in corporate America. We send all those decks out ahead of time. We have everybody read them. And then we have everybody fill out the app, say, based on everything I read, here are my main takeaways.
David Senra (00:53:20):
And here are the main questions that I think are so important in terms of creating value that we should, the whole team, all 25 of us who are in that meeting, spend time debating and discussing around the table in the limited time we've got, because 10 hours goes by like that. And then I send back out the takeaways and I send back out the questions. People rank them on a scale of one to 10. Again, we have an app for this. Then I send people the takeaways. Here's how they were rated. Here's what people thought were the most important takeaways. Very valuable. Now you've got the benefit of everybody's perspectives on the same data.
David Senra (00:53:52):
So people have seen the same charts, the same data, the same metrics, same KPIs, but they've seen it from a little different angle. It's very enlightening. And then I've got the questions. I tell everybody, rate the question one to 10. And then all the questions that are rated 8, 9, and 10, and between 8 and 10, that's the agenda, David. That's what we talked about. So we just went, then we put them in categories. Everything about tech that was rated 8 or above, here they are. Everything that was on comp or people, everything was on strategic, everything was an MA, all the different categories. Only the ones that the group voted on, at least in eight.
David Senra (00:54:25):
Now, what is the consequence of that? Number one, we have an amazing meeting. Like, it's a good agenda, much better than I could come up with. Because now it's got everybody's angle on it. It's group sourced. Secondly, everybody's involved in it because the boss didn't come down and like, here's the agenda. It's like, we collectively made the agenda. So people realize the truth of the matter is we really respect each other's opinions. There's no one person who's the authoritarian figure who's like teaching everybody else. It's a group. I've created a group.
David Senra (00:54:56):
I've created a super organism. I've created like a beehive or an ant colony or a brain or a human body, super organisms. Things that are a collection of people that the sum is greater than the collection of the parts. And the whole is greater than each individual. We have a holistic, powerful approach to that. That's how I run the business. How many people would be in a meeting like that? So I've experimented with this over the years. I used to have larger meetings with 40 or 50 people, and it just didn't work. And so those meetings, those monthly operating reviews, which are the most important meeting of the month, then the most senior people in the company come together and do the exercise I just mentioned for 10 hours with almost no breaks, almost no breaks at all.
David Senra (00:55:38):
That I have 25 people, and I limit it to 25. I don't want more than 25. I don't know what's so magic about 25, but 20 to 25 is the ideal group. You have enough people that you get diversity of opinion, and you have dialectical discussions, meaning looking at issues from multiple perspectives, then analyzing those and synthesizing them and finding the truth. But you don't have so many people that you're, you know, people are peacocking and trying to impress each other and don't want to be vulnerable. You want people to be vulnerable. You want people to be to trust the other people in the room so much that you've created a safe zone to say, you know what?
David Senra (00:56:12):
I've been thinking this and thinking this, but the more I'm listening to you and the more I'm hearing about this, I may be wrong. Maybe I got this thing completely upside down. I'm starting to come around to looking at it like this with one little twist. Now I think what we should do is XYZ. And then what do you all think of that? That's a fantastic conversation. When you have leaders of the company feeling it's safe to show that, hey, I was wrong. I was thinking wrong. And I model that. I role model that myself all the time. Be flexible in thinking. Don't be rigid in thinking. Don't be black and white to dichotomous thinking, but be open-minded, be receptive, to be willing to learn and to be challenged.
David Senra (00:56:47):
And that's okay to be proven wrong. It's actually a good thing. We're learning together. Two questions on that. How, what percent of the meeting are you speaking in a situation like that? So I open up usually and I ramble on for like an hour or maybe even more than an hour of the state of the union from my perspective. And I try not to just mention things that I form conclusions on, but I try to frame things of these are the most important successes of the company, but these are the things where we need to improve. And here are the issues that, in my view, after reading everybody's votes and everything, I think are the things we should attention direct.
David Senra (00:57:23):
We should spend most of my time selling because I think those will create the most amount of value. And I try to keep it balanced, the good stuff and the bad stuff. Yes, I do add a boys and add of girls and rah raws. That's a good thing to do for leadership. But I, in equal measure, do, look, we've got to keep it real. We got to keep it honest. Here's things that we said by this deadline we're going to do it. We're a couple weeks behind on this. Let's get going here. What's going on? Here's we thought this outcome was going to happen and we're only 92% there. How can we get to 100%? So I try to start off with a balance, but then I try to shut up. And then I try to let the mechanical going through the questions where I just go down the questions by categories and then go around the room and hear everyone's opinion.
David Senra (00:58:02):
And that's, you don't want the leader talking a huge amount of time. Yeah, so you basically start with an hour. Then in this case, the nine hours for this are meeting. Everyone else. Everyone else. I'm not talking to, but not inordinately. I've already used up my hour, for God's sake. Yeah, this is one of the things that I felt, and I've seen this with a lot with really remarkable people, is how many people, like when we had this intense breakfast at your house a few months ago, you had a notepad and you were, I'm talking and you're taking notes. I'm like, what the hell is going on?
David Senra (00:58:33):
It's very cool stuff. No, but it should be the reverse. In fact, I have a story about this and then I want another question for you. Was Mitch Rails, obviously one of the founders of Dana here. Great company. Oh, incredible. And Dana Herway. Yeah, he's actually a mentor of two close friends of mine. So I get insights from them about him and just one of the most remarkable things that he did. But he was at this vertical market software conference. It was only like 40 people there recently.
David Senra (00:59:03):
And a friend of mine, I was going for a walk in New York City about this. And he's just like, I don't understand. The guy sat in the front row. He's the most successful person there by far. And he was just taking notes the whole time. I was like, that is why he's successful. It's not the reverse. It's not that you go and you build a $200 billion company, whatever it is, and then take notes. He was like that his whole time. Just the relentless, like, you have valuable information. Great. I just did this episode in Jimmy Iveen. He's a very fascinating person. And he's this great line. He said, great can come from anywhere. And then you have this other thing. I'll get back to that. Great, anywhere.
David Senra (00:59:34):
He's in the music business. His point was that he was trying to help. He was partners and a mentor of Dr. Dre, who's one of the greatest hip-hop producers of all time. Dre didn't have an artist to work with. They wind up getting this demo tape from Eminem. And at the time, he's this poor kid in Michigan living in a trailer park, right? No, like no resources at all. And yet they're like, we weren't looking for somebody to be controversial. We were looking for great. And guess what? It can come from anywhere. It came from. This kid that was obsessed sitting in a freaking trailer park saying, I want to do this thing, and I'm going to do this to the best of my ability.
David Senra (01:00:04):
I want to talk about, I'm going to go back to this question I have, but you have, I love this idea of grabbing information, which is really fascinating. There's multiple examples in your book, and I find these in other books where it's just like, it's so nuts that, especially when companies get big and older, they don't, they stop asking information from people from the front line. So you're like, often when we buy a company, we discover that the frontline employees, middle managers, and even some senior executives have never been asked, what would you like, what would you do to improve the company?
David Senra (01:00:36):
You would think owners would want to know that. And then you have this great thing that I think is actually good for business, but also personal issues. You ask, what is the stupidest thing we're doing? And what is the smartest thing we're doing? This ability to like, you just almost described it in these meetings. It's like, hey, we're going to disperse and ask these questions and see what comes back. And then we'll rank the information. So at the end of those operating reviews, once we've gone through all the lists, now we do human interactions. That's where the fun starts. So we work really hard solving all these problems and debating all these issues.
David Senra (01:01:06):
Now we put that aside. And I ask a series of questions. I modify them a little bit every month, but I have a list of a few dozen questions. I pick which ones I want to ask each time. Usually one of the first ones is, what is something somebody said today that you have a different opinion on? What is something that somebody said you disagree with and you need to get a chance to talk about it? And I just go around one by one to each person. That's a wonderful thing. Many management teams can't do that because everyone will get upset. Here it's like, great, this is, and then we have a nice, I ask everyone, what's your single biggest takeaway from today?
David Senra (01:01:39):
What is something that 10 hours ago you didn't understand about how we're going to make money and how we're going to serve customers better and how we're going to improve employee engagement and how we're going to kill the competition. What is something you didn't know? What is something you learned? And just go around one by one by one by one. And then I ask them, when I think about people not in this room, but people in the organization out there in the field, who's an MVP? Who's the most valuable player? Who's somebody who's going above and beyond that you really respect, you really admire, you really think is amazing. Wish we had a thousand more like that person.
David Senra (01:02:11):
And why? And I send an email to them afterwards saying, hey, I was in a meeting with the leaders of the company, and you were nominated as an MVP because XYZ. People love it. So I just start crying. There's a lot of times. It's really, really emotional thing. It's a really, really nice thing. Validating the field. And then I bring it inwards and I say, who around this table today, in your mind, did their star go up? The star already might have been high because everyone loves each other, but even higher. And why? What is something that somebody said today in the meeting that impressed you, that made you go, aha, or made you say, damn, that's a good insight.
David Senra (01:02:45):
That's a good perception. I really like that. Who was it? What did they say? We go around and everything like that. And I have a few other questions like that. And then I bring it down to the person themselves. And I say, finish the sentence. I resolve to improve the company by, just go one by one. And each person stands up and says, I resolved to improve the company by, and then they say what they want to say. It's a great thing. What I didn't get a chance to do Friday because we ran out of time, what I often do is then we go into another room, we get out of the boardroom, get out of the conference room, and then we stand in a circle and just silently look at each other for the first couple minutes.
David Senra (01:03:23):
A couple minutes is a long time to be like looking around everybody else. A lot of people, it's uncomfortable. It's not uncomfortable if you all like each other. And look at each person and say, I admire this person because. Like, what are the strengths? What are the qualities? What are the traits? What are the skills? What are the things that they do that you really are impressed with? You really like that person a lot. And just go one by one, look at each person and just identify that. And then after a minute or two has gone by, I say, okay, now let's do the same thing.
David Senra (01:03:54):
Look at each person and say, I really, so we've already said why I'm grateful they're on the team. So now I want to say, so with gratitude, gratitude is a wonderful leadership technique. And then the second thing is, I really wish that person great success in the company. And I can picture this company five years from now accomplishing XYZ. And I send nice vibes. I send love vibes to that person. Just go around one by one, all silently. Nothing out loud. Just one by one, by one, by one. And you start seeing people smile.
David Senra (01:04:24):
Like always, I've done it so many times. You start seeing people smile. You start looking at people. You see looking at people in a very positive, uplifting way, an appreciative way. And then I say, okay, now we've concluded the day, and I declare the day of success and congratulations. Then we just clap and we clap. Sometimes this clapping goes on for like five minutes. That's like really, really goes out. But it's a very, then people levitate home. Go to the airport and go home. How much of your, the way you run your company is like guided by intuition. Like you seem like a very intuitive person to me.
David Senra (01:04:55):
Maybe not as much as you think. No? Yes, there's always instinct. There's always intuition. You're always going by your gut. But like, how would you even know? Like, this is, this is an unusual, like what you just described. Like, how did you learn that? So I've experimented over time. Okay. I've experimented with different things. I've read a lot. I've studied positive psychology. I've studied cognitive therapy. I've studied a lot of stuff. I read a lot of stuff. I meditate a lot. I do things that worked for me. So I think of things that have worked for me on my path, my evolution of feeling gratitude and all the happiness that comes with feeling gratitude by feeling appreciation, by problem solving, all the different things.
David Senra (01:05:33):
And I try to imbibe that to other people. And then if it works, so feedback loops. One of the key tenets of all my companies is we have intense, voluminous feedback loops, feedback loops between the senior team, feedback loops between the senior team and mid-level management, senior feedback loops between senior, medium, and frontline management, feedback loops with customers, feedback loops with vendors, feedback loops with investors, all the constituents of the constellation that make a corporation, that make a company.
David Senra (01:06:07):
We have to be communicating. We have to be communicating very intensely with each other in an honest way and then sharing that information. I share information much more widely in my organisms and my organizations than most companies. Most companies, they're afraid to share it. They're afraid to share. They're afraid to share the good information. They think a competitor is going to hear about it. Okay, well, they will. But let them try to copy us. They don't have all the ingredients to do that. Or they say, we don't want to share the bad stuff because then the market's going to hear our weaknesses.
David Senra (01:06:40):
Okay, well, that's kind of true, too. That's so much overshadowed by the benefit of we're learning where we have to improve. We're learning how to become better. I read something Jeff Bezos said that changed my perspective on the importance of high quality sleep. He said that he makes sure he gets eight hours of sleep a night. And as a result, his mood, his energy, and his decision making is improved. His point was that you get paid to make high quality decisions, and you can't do that if you're sleeping terribly. And the product that has made the biggest impact on my quality of sleep for years is 8-Sleep.
David Senra (01:07:14):
I'm lucky enough to be friends with the founder of 8-Sleep, Mateo, and we live in the same city. A few months after I started using 8-Sleep, I randomly ran into Mateo at a restaurant, and I was with some friends. So I'd go over and say, hi. When I got back to my table, my friend asked me, who was I talking to? And I said, that's Matteo, the founder of 8-Sleep. And my friend replied, he looks like he gets good sleep. Matteo is living and breathing his product. I had never had the ability to change the temperature of my bed before I had an 8-sleep. I had no idea how much that would improve the quality of my sleep.
David Senra (01:07:44):
I keep my 8-sleep ice cold. It's cold before I get into bed. So I fall asleep faster and wake up less during the night. That feature alone is worth 10 times the price. There are very few no-brainer investments in life, and I believe 8-sleep is one of them. That is why elite founders like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have all said publicly that they use 8-Sleep. I would recommend getting the Pod5, which is the newest generation of their signature product. It is a smart mattress cover that you place on top of your existing mattress, and it is next-level sleep tech.
David Senra (01:08:15):
It automatically regulates your body temperature throughout the night, independently for each side of the bed. The result is you get up to a full hour of additional quality sleep per night. Make the no-brainer investment in your sleep by going to 8sleep.com forward slash Senra and use the code Senra to get $350 off. You can try it for 30 days at home and return it if you don't like it, but I'm confident you will love it. I will never let anyone take my 8-sleep from me. Make sure you get yours at 8Sleep.com forward slash Senra.
David Senra (01:08:46):
So this is what you were describing earlier, this like almost a constant iterative trial and error process. Absolutely. And just keeping the information flowing through the company. There's an idea that I think when I thought of your ideas, like, hey, we're going to buy the company. We're going to ask, like, what would you do if you were running the company? What's the stupidest thing we're doing? What's the smartest thing we're doing? I, as you know, like very, I'm not interested. I'm interested in timeless principles, not timely, right? And when I read that in your book, what I thought of was not you building your company. I thought of Jim Casey building UPS 100 years ago. And what he learned, because a lot of these things, these ideas have survived for a long period of time, they're not dependent on the company.
David Senra (01:09:19):
They really depend on human nature because history doesn't repeat human nature does, right? Human nature is kind of constant, doesn't really change. And so what Jim realized is the more successful he became, the more successful his company became. His executives, their incentives were to hide the bad news and just tell them good things. Because then it's like, everything's great in the company, Jim. And so like, and I was the one that made that great. So pay me more and like make sure I keep this great job I have. And Jim realizes like, oh, I need to have constant, unfiltered access from the people that are delivering the service to my customers.
David Senra (01:09:49):
So he would, he would do is like, he would, he would instruct his driver, every time we see a brown UPS truck, you were to pull over. And he would get out, no matter how successful he was, and he would talk. Talk to the driver. I love it. Unfiltered information. Same thing. People would go and they try to meet Sam Walton in Bentonville, Arkansas, right? They'd show up. They even have appointment on the books. And they'd walk into the office and they're like, hey, I'm here to meet Sam for 7 a.m. meeting. And his secretary is like, he hopped on because he used to fly his own plane. He left at 5 a.m.
David Senra (01:10:19):
this morning and he went to this Walmart over here and he's hanging out and like greeting customers and talking to the people stocking the shelves and everything else. But this constant, I think there's a lot of wisdom in what you said in your book, basically is what I'm saying. It's like you see this over and over again. They want unfiltered access from the front lines. They don't want the information to be massaged or presented in a manner that seems good. So Todd Combs is one of Warren Buffett's managers. And we were talking on a Saturday about, I don't know, 10 years ago, 8, 9, 10 years ago, when he was first, he was getting on the JP Morgan board and he was kind of moving up in the world, stuff like that.
David Senra (01:10:55):
I lost touch with him, but really great guy, really smart guy. And he said, what are you doing? I said, I'm reading employee surveys. I'm reading all the employee surveys from the whole company. We ask him two questions. What's your single best idea to improve the company and rate your job satisfaction scale of one to 10? And sometimes we add a third row of what do we take to make it a 10. And I just go through all these one by one because I feel like I'm talking to every employee and learning on that. He said, that's amazing. So what's so amazing about that? So I was just talking to Bezos, and Bezos was reading customer service.
David Senra (01:11:26):
Customer service. So I'm talking. So he's talking to customers. I'm talking to employees. It's the same concept. You need feedback loops. You don't know how you're doing unless you have radar, like sending beep, beep out there and seeing how it comes back. You have to have this very intense feedback. This is why I'm so obsessed with what I'm doing because nothing we're doing is new. Like you had all these people that ran all these kind of experiments for centuries and they built great companies. And just because they passed on and maybe the company's not around anymore, it's like there's so there's a treasure trove of data in there. So like the Bezos idea I love where he would publicize it.
David Senra (01:11:58):
He used to publicize in the very early days of Amazon. Jeff at Amazon.com email me. And he read part of the one of the reasons that he figured out he's like, oh, we can't just sell books. Like I could sell anything. He'd be like, he would send emails to, I think, like the top 1,000 customers. Like, what else would you buy? And one guy, he had this epiphany because they'd be like, hey, I want toilet paper. I want groceries, whatever. One guy's like, I want windshield wipers. And he's like, windshield wipers? If this guy wants windshield wipers, I'm going to be able to sell everything. Like it is a true everything store. But I was thinking about this recently because I just read this book translated from French about the Michelin family dynasty, which starts out in 1891, selling tires in France.
David Senra (01:12:33):
You're selling tires. There's like 350 cars on the road, for God's sake. But there's a line in the book that is related to all this where they start, the two brothers have to take over this failing factory. And they don't know what to make because most of the products that they're manufacturing are unprofitable. They're on the brink of bankruptcy. They're one profitable product, which they eliminate everything else and they focus on the one profitable product, which is a rubber brake pad for horse-drawn carriages. Say that again, though. A rubber brake pad for horse-drawn carriages. This is 1888.
David Senra (01:13:03):
And so it takes them like a year or two to figure out, like, hey, we should manufacture rubber. And there's two twin phenomena. You should talk about get, remember what Justice said, get the major trend, right? Yeah. They're like, well, horse-drawn carriages have been around for a while. You know what's growing way faster? Bicycles and then cars, even from a small number. Like, we need to go to where the technology's going. But the point being, he's like, so we need to make more products. We need to make rubber tires. And the guy took over a factory. He's like, I don't know how to do that. So his answer was he would go and it sounds just like, what'd you do? He only had like 50 employees that were making the rubber brake pads.
David Senra (01:13:35):
And he would just ask questions. He's like, I came to them and I admitted my ignorance. I go, I know nothing about rubber manufacturing. Why'd you do that? Can you explain to me? What if we did? And not in like what you just said, you said something about not like coming down from on high. It's like a peer almost like, teach me. Yes. And he's like, it was wildly effective. And he's got a great line in that book. He's like, it turns out the guy that handles the material for eight hours a day while the CO is in the office has something to teach you. Like he's going to understand something about that process because you have like a bird level view.
David Senra (01:14:06):
He has a very particular job and he found it very instructive. And he's like, it was a wonderful way to learn the business. And then that led him to like, oh, now I know how to make things. And then from there to grow and grow and grow. And I just absolutely love this idea. It's like, you should have this unfiltered access, unfiltered information over and over and over again. Completely. All the different constituents in an organization need to be talking to each other, need to have feedback loops to know how they're doing. If you're not asking your customers how you're doing, you may think you're doing a lot better than you really are.
David Senra (01:14:37):
How do you figure out how you're doing in your position? I ask all day long. And we have different modalities of anonymous surveys and 360 reviews. And I'm interacting with the teams non-stop all day long. I'm walking at people's offices, what's going on, what do you think of this? What do you think of that? You like the, you have this great line in your book where it says, I love working with outrageously talented people to deliver outside returns for shareholders in public stock markets. I love that. This constant feedback from the public market. It's fantastic.
David Senra (01:15:08):
You love it. Yeah. I don't always agree with it, but some of it, there's always some truth in it. You get free advice from like the smartest people in the world, the global allocators, people who have raised billions of dollars from pensions and endowments and sovereign wealth funds. And now they're analyzing what you're doing and they're giving you advice. They're telling you, this is what I like, this is what I don't like. Okay. You don't have to, actually, you mathematically can't agree with it all because a lot of times you get conflicting advice.
David Senra (01:15:38):
People saying, you're going right, you should be going left. Another guy's saying you should go left even more. So it's good to hear all this stuff. It's good to hear what people are saying. But then you have to go within yourself and you have to, you got to make the decision. You have to be an adult. You take in tons and tons of information and opinions and beliefs and data as much as possible. Then you've got to kind of just ignore all that. Just go inside and say, this is what I want to do. You're going to make the call. That's what a CEO does. That's what the leader does, is you make the call.
David Senra (01:16:08):
But you have to get all that input. Otherwise, you're in a bubble chamber, echo chamber. You're just hearing your own thoughts instead of others. You want people challenging your thoughts all the time. I think for a long time, one big goal was starting a company and then taking it public. And now I talk to a lot of founders, and even the ones that raise a lot of money, and they don't want to ever go public. Do you have any? I love being public. What advice would you give to somebody that's say 30 years younger than you? They're trying to build a great company. They've raised a bunch of money, but they don't want to go public.
David Senra (01:16:39):
Well, they have to be at a level of maturity of the company to go public. They have to be preferably profitable. There's a bunch of them like this that want to go public. Yeah, yeah. That reach that criteria and are choosing not to. You know, it'd be interesting to ask them why. What's the reason why you don't want public? I think people think, yeah, I can't speak for them, but I think they're like maybe the scared of the public scrutiny, the hassle, the... But that goes back to what we were talking about an hour ago is, so they might have a core belief saying, I need everybody to always be like saying great stuff about me, which is never going to happen.
David Senra (01:17:10):
And they may think that, gee, if I go public, when you're public, at any moment in time, you have people in favor of you and people who are naysayers. You have people who are selling and buying. The people selling think you're overvalued. The people who are buying get the joke and they understand you have a real, real business plan here that's going to create much more value. So you always have those two different things going. Maybe those people don't want to hear the naysayers. Maybe those people don't understand that naysayers sometimes can help you correct your own path. Can tell you, gee, you know, maybe I'm cutting costs too much. People come in and say, you're cutting costs too much.
David Senra (01:17:42):
I visited one of your locations. I didn't think the service was so great. Oh, wow. I didn't know that. Thank you for telling me that. So now I have to invest more rather than cut costs. You have other people who say, you know, I'm looking at your numbers here. Your margins are growing, which is great. That's only half the situation here. The other situation is, what are you doing with your top line? What are you doing with your price and volume? What are you doing with your organic growth? In my business, in all my businesses, the only two things I had to do in the end in order to get great valuations and create shareholder value were grow the top line faster than the competition, faster than the market, be taking share, and growing the margins, increasing the market, increasing the profit margins.
David Senra (01:18:19):
If I did those two things, everything else flowed. Everything else flowed from that. But those are the two main things. In order to do those, accomplish those two things, you want as much input as possible. You want as many, many, many chefs in the kitchen as you possibly can. The public gets you hundreds and thousands of voices. So it's amazing data. It also being public allows you to build a brand much faster and much more voluminously. Explain that part? So you want to be a magnet for talent for drivers, for people in the branches, for people in mid-level management. You want to be going back to what you said before, you always want great talent coming in.
David Senra (01:18:52):
Well, if nobody knows who you are, they're a little skeptical about joining your company. If you have research written about you by bunches of firms and you have press releases and a public website and you're very well known what you're doing, it's very clear what you're doing. People say, okay, I get it. You're a known quantity and I like this. I buy into it. I like what you're doing. I want to join the company. So in order to, and then you can pay them. You compensate them with stuff they can look on their iPhone every day and see the value of the compensation. If you're private, you give people these phantom shares or whatever the compensation plan is.
David Senra (01:19:23):
They don't really know the value of it until they sell it someday. And it may be very different than what they thought it was all along. So from a compensation point of view, which is a big element of success in these high-growth business plans, being public is fantastic. Was there ever a time in your career where you're like, maybe I should do a private company instead? Or you were pretty much all in on it. I've been doing public since 1992, and I'm non-stop. And I like it. I enjoy it. I find it very helpful, very constructive. I like the pressure. I like the ability to hear what the street says and then agree with what I agree with, but disagree with what I think is wrong, what I feel passionately.
David Senra (01:20:00):
And have evidence to support their wrong. So sometimes the street, particularly like the hedge funds, they're very focused on like this quarter, like the next 90 days. That's a terrible thing long term. You don't want to be focusing on just what's good for the quarter. You end up, you see these public companies that go out and they cut costs in the field that hurts customer service or hurts employee morale, and they're understaffed, which is even worse than being overstaffed, which is bad. And here, it's a completely different story. So, yeah, I like being public. You said something interesting. I like the pressure.
David Senra (01:20:30):
I do. Thrive on it. What do you mean by that? So many people give you the money, whether it's a retail individual, whether it's a high-net worth family, whether it's a sovereign wealth fund, whether it's a pension plan, whether it's an endowment. All these people are investing, long-only funds, mutual funds. All these people are giving you, they're wiring money to buy your shares. This is a intense pressure. This is probably the biggest pressure I have in life, is to make sure that I do everything I possibly can to make sure I give them back more money than they gave me.
David Senra (01:21:04):
Make sure that they invest in the company. And like, if you look at my neighbors and my friends, I don't know the exact number, but I would guess over 90% of them are invested in the company. And that's what it's been over time. Well, that's pressure, man. That's like, wow, I don't want to disappoint them. These are my relatives. These are my friends. These are people I really love. These are people, people come to say, look, I believe in you so much. I put two-thirds of my retirement plan in your stock. No, forget there's reversification. Boom. I'm going all in on Brad and his team. Well, that's a lot of pressure. I like that pressure.
David Senra (01:21:35):
I enjoy that pressure. That motivates me. That inspires me. That makes me feel, I have something to do here that's important. I think that's so important to put that out. Because we were talking about the negative self-talk and like, you know, just living a pretty crazy life where it's like you want to work seven days a week or you're just completely all in. And the way some, again, this goes back to you can hear a sentence and just be like, oh, I feel that way too. And it kind of changes the way you approach things. And I remember reading about Herb Kelleher, which is the founder of Southwest Airlines. You know, it's such a crazy story that like in an industry where bankruptcy is the most common outcome.
David Senra (01:22:10):
The guy had, his company was profitable for 40 straight years. This is nuts. And he's like a nut job. He's drinking a fifth of bourbon every day. He's chain smoking cigarettes. No, no, no. No, but he's like, I don't advocate that. No, he wouldn't sleep. He's like, these are hilarious stories in his life. And I thought he was like, he just lived on the edge and completely all in. There's a great story about this where they try to get him, you know, he'd chain smoke and then drink a fifth of bourbon every day. And they're like, but then he had like prostate cancer or something like that. I'm like, you should stop smoking. He's like, I don't smoke with my prostate.
David Senra (01:22:43):
But that's not the thing that I remember. The thing that I loved in an interview one time, they're like, you have like, you deal with a ton of stress. Like, how do you handle it? He goes, I don't handle it. I like it. He wanted stress. He's like, I want to be in the game. Yes. He was an attorney. He didn't start his company. It was his first company. He was an attorney until he was 35 years old. And then it's like, hey, I'm going to try to do an interstate or intrastate airline. And then he had, it was like four years of legal fights before he could even take his first flight. He's just like, I love this shit.
David Senra (01:23:13):
This is what I want. I want the pressure. Passion. What I love about this is it's in your book. You constantly talk about the other people, the other entrepreneurs, other investors, other CEOs that you learn from. Then acknowledgements, all these maxims from all these other brilliant people. You talk about, obviously, Ludwig Justin. I do want to talk about it. I read something on LinkedIn about other, I'm going to talk about the other people that you've learned from, the other founders, CEOs, executives that you admire. I want to start with Fred Smith since he passed away.
David Senra (01:23:45):
I read his biography probably like four or five years ago. And tell me if I'm wrong, you know more about this industry than I do. It just seems like FedEx had to be one of the most difficult operational companies to ever invent. Like an unbelievable. You're talking about somebody who wanted pressure. Yeah, the complexity. You wrote on LinkedIn that you never missed an opportunity to spend time with them and you admired them. Could you just tell like why? So Fred endorsed my book. Yeah, I saw. And I was very touched. He did that. He was a competitor. Literally, most of the competitors endorsed my book.
David Senra (01:24:17):
So Fred was an amazing guy. I mean, this is a very special. You meet people in life that are just special, that are certain integrity. So I met Fred for the first time in 2013. And I was doing a bunch. I came out of nowhere from this industry. I got in in 2011, but I really started doing a bunch of acquisitions out of nowhere. And suddenly I was on the front pages of the trade journals. And I was in Atlanta at the National Association of Manufacturers, NAM conference. And Fred was the keynote.
David Senra (01:24:48):
So I was in the audience watching him. And somebody said, what do you think of Brad Jacobs? I go, oh my God. Oh, my God. Fred Smith's about to destroy me. My brand is going to be completely crushed. You know, the icon of the industry is going to say, oh, yeah, I don't believe he's really. And he said, I really like watching that guy work. He said, he is coming into this industry with courage and buying things left and right and has big goals and big ambitions. And I'm going to keep an eye on that guy.
David Senra (01:25:19):
And I cried. I said, wow, Fred Smith saying great stuff. So I went up to him afterwards, after the speech was over. And I said, Mr. Smith, I'm Brad Jacobs. I really appreciate what you said. He said, well, first of all, I'm Fred. And that was the beginning of a great, great friendship. And we got together many, many times. Of course, he was on the business council. He was the longest serving member of the business council over a quarter of a century. Oh, wow. And I go to every business council meeting I possibly can to meet other CEOs and to hear what other people are thinking. He was just a generous guy.
David Senra (01:25:50):
This was a guy who had vision. He had passion. Talk about grit. I mean, maybe he was flying around all the time everywhere. Vietnam, he was decorative. He was flying helicopters with people shooting bullets at him to go get Marines who had been, he was a Marine. Marines who had been killed, but you don't leave any Marine behind. He'd go in there. He's risking his life with bullets like shot me shooting at him to go get the remains of a Ted Marie. Yeah. Putting his own life online. He got a purple heart. He got silver. He got brief. I mean, he's serious, serious, serious, courageous, high-integrity guy.
David Senra (01:26:22):
And everybody, everybody loved, everybody loved Fred. Everybody loved Freddy. The opening paragraph of his biography is the craziest opening paragraph I ever heard. I'm just going to paraphrase it. Essentially, like, you know, he's in debt. He ran through like his, his greyhound, his dad's Greyhound bus millions. I think he burned to like 15 or 20 million. His planes are about to be confiscated. They just got fired by his board. The FBI is investigating him. He goes to Vegas.
David Senra (01:26:53):
Yes. And then they're like, he thought, he thought, and he was like 30 years old at the time, so still young, but he refused to let his Federal Express Dream die. And the line was just like, he thought of suicide. And then the next paragraph is like, but the idea of Fred jumping out a window is ludicrous. He's more likely to throw somebody out of a window. He's just like a guy that you like, he was like the terminal. You couldn't stop, like he just wouldn't stop coming. There's a few lines. No, I don't recognize that in him. So throwing something out the window. I mean, I was. At 30, I think he might have been a little different. Well, maybe. But I was a direct competitor of him in transportation and logistics and tomorrow.
David Senra (01:27:28):
Not in package, because we didn't do package, but pretty much all the other lines of business. We competed against him. He was generous. He was charitable. He would always take a meeting with me. He used to come to my house. We'd spend hours and hours talking about everything. This is what is so special. I know it's part of humanity in general, but entrepreneurship in particular is just like, you see this over and over again, just how generous these people are with, because they know how fucking hard it is. They just went through all this. And now we might be 15, 20, 30 years different in age, but it's like, just like Ludwig Justiceon did when you were 23. And in many cases, like what you did with the book.
David Senra (01:27:59):
Like the idea, like think about Sam Walton, right? He wrote his autobiography. His cancer was all over his body. He was in pain. He knows his time is towards the end. And what does he do? He spends a big chunk of the last time he had left saying, this is what I learned in my six decade long career. That is a gift to future generations. And then in the book, they're like, somebody, I love this part because in the book, they're like, people ask me all the time, could another Walmart story happen? He's like, yeah, it's probably happening right now. And it was Jeff Bezos going around with his copy of the book, writing it, annotating it, giving it to the executives, the early executives, Amazon.
David Senra (01:28:36):
It's such a beautiful thing that Fred would do that. It's what a beautiful thing you did for your book. But Fred and Amazon didn't get along. No, no, no. I'm saying, but like, in general, yeah, obviously. Well, yeah, I can see why. But my point being is that the transfer of, even for competitors, he was, Fred was your competitor, but he's transferring knowledge to you. Absolutely. I don't think people understand how much that goes. I'm glad you just said that. Because yeah, you can see in the books. You hear stories like that. They endorsed my book. Exactly. You hear stories like that all the time in private. And for you to say that, I think it's really important. There's a few things I pulled out from his biography that just remind me of you.
David Senra (01:29:08):
And I'm curious if you agree with some of these things. One, the amount. It's about Fred Smith. If I don't have that trait, I should work on getting it. Okay, well, perfect. The amount of information. So like, think about it. Like, he started in FedEx in the 60s, I think, something like that. No, after Vietnam, so maybe early 70s. But in the 80s, he says that he estimated during the 1980s, he spent four hours a day reading. He says he found he relied quite heavily on his own vision backed by assimilating information, which you've mentioned multiple times so far from many different disciplines at once.
David Senra (01:29:41):
You talked about that meetings, you talked about in trade journals, you talked about all the research you do, right? This is his quote, though, that I want to read to you. The common trait of people who supposedly have vision is they spend a lot of time reading and gathering information and then synthesize it until they come up with an idea. That sounds like you to me. I like that. Yeah. Going back to what I said before. Want to be rigid in your thinking. You want to be open-minded. You want to be flexible. You want to be scientific about it. That if new evidence comes along that disproves your theory, then modify your theory. Go by the evidence.
David Senra (01:30:11):
Go by the facts. You want to get, you want to interact with people who you respect, and you want to be picking their brain all the time. But you're also like a lot. The way I describe this, you're also alive and paying attention. Like the story in your book where you're like reading a magazine in bed on a Sunday morning and you read about like these waste management companies making like $500 million in profit. You're like, whoa, what? Like they're picking up trash from one spot and bringing it to another. I need to learn about this industry. But that's my point. Like people like Fred, people like you, I think, you know, there's a ton of people that have the same thing, where it's like the whole world is like a classroom if you're actually paying attention.
David Senra (01:30:46):
Like you can pick up ideas all over the place. So the waste management business, I contrasted to the oil business. The oil business is a lot more complex. They're negotiating complicated long-term contracts and chartering vessels and negotiating processing agreements with big major oil companies and hedging. I mean, it's a very, very complicated, complex business. When I read that about the garbage business, I said that is so much easier picking up. That's a simple business. They move some garbage and send out an invoice. I definitely think I can do that. And it seems like they make a lot of money.
David Senra (01:31:17):
And the trend seemed in the right direction. So, yeah, you want to. Oh, and the application of technology, which is I love how at the end of your book, you have essentially what are all the some key ideas, some key technology developed by humans starting back 300,000 years ago, and you move forward. I thought that was a beautiful way to just put that in the Kurzweil, by the way, Ray Kurzweil. So Ray Kurzweil, huge mentor of mine. Only met him once, met him for about six hours. But I've read every book he's written. I've read every article about him.
David Senra (01:31:47):
I see every YouTube. I'm a Ray Kurzweil fan. And what I read in the Singularity is Near in 2005, 2006 when that book came out was amazing, where it was a chronology of the universe going, you know, my meditation. I go back to space and time. I said, Kindred Spirit here. This is somebody who thinks in large scale of time. And what are the key things that have happened over the last 13 billion years and reducing that down to a couple hundred points? I thought it was real helpful. So I modified it a bit and made it more specific to business, things that would be applicable to business.
David Senra (01:32:21):
But the main trend, going back to Mr. Justin about you got to get the main trend right, the main trend for the last two million years has been humans creating tools, aka technology, to do things, to outsource to those things that do better than us, that free up our time. So whether it was fire, whether it was a wheel, whether it was the printing press, and more recently, all the digital electronic stuff we've done and all the internet and now artificial intelligence and robotics and nanotechnology.
David Senra (01:32:53):
This is the trend. The main trend in life and therefore in business is technology. Outsourcing our senses, outsourcing our memory, outsourcing now our intellect, our speech to computers, to the cloud. This is big. This is really, really, really big. So when I looked at 55 different industries before I picked building products, I ruled out a bunch of them. So this looks like an interesting industry, but I think AI and automation are going to kaibosh it. And I didn't do it. And I mentioned in the book, there was one particular online education company.
David Senra (01:33:25):
It was called Chegg. And I said, I don't know. They seem like you got a good business, but I think the AI is going to come in and basically do that for free. Well, you know, and I said, I think the stock might come down. Well, stock came down a lot, you know, from 50 to single digits. So fortunately, I made a good prediction there. As Yogi Barrett said, predictions are difficult, particularly when they're about the future. But that turned out to be a good prediction. Why was that a good prediction? Because to me, I'm looking at it saying the main trend, the long-term trend, is to use technology to do things that we've been doing ourselves.
David Senra (01:34:00):
And so I'm always trying to look at these different work streams and say, is that something that can be automated? Is that something that's going to be AI or robotics going forward? And then capitalizing on that. And the opportunity to always do something slightly better, which is invent tools to do so, technology. He even starts out when you were talking about collecting. Sometimes a lot better, not slightly better. But the good thing is, like, this is not exclusive to the time we live in. It's a constant throughout our experience. You can go and look at the, like, when you guys were collecting all, this is what you said before, facts, before email.
David Senra (01:34:31):
You were collecting all the information for Amorex. Yes, yeah. You know, 40 years ago. Yeah. And then the waste management, when you're like, hey, how are, like, I should get into this. And then you realize, wait, they're not even using technology to figure out the most efficient route. And this constant application of technology is one of the things I'm glad it was on my notes, but I'm glad you brought, like, directed the conversation there because the way I thought about this has really crystallized my mind when I read Andrew Carnegie's autobiography, right? Which is probably written 130 years ago.
David Senra (01:35:02):
And for whatever reason, if you talk to somebody today, they don't think of like the production of steel as technology, which is like a crazy thing. At the time, it was like they literally invented a new and a better way, and then everything in the world was going to be made out of this. And so what I do is when I'm finished reading a book, again, we go back to this idea that you and I share. We have to like distill it. You're not going to remember 250 pages, but you'll remember a paragraph or a sentence if you can. And Andrew's a young person getting into an existing industry. It's a new industry, but it's still an existing industry.
David Senra (01:35:32):
Most of his competitors were much older, and they were very resistant, to your point, resistant to change. You cannot be resistant to change. You have to embrace the major trend, which is what your mentor told you. And so I was hearing the criticism that his competitors, almost like when you were in that business and the guy took you out to lunch, it's like, slow down. I used to be the first. Now I'm the second. That's a terrible way to do business. Like, take your competitor out to lunch and be like, stop being better than me.
David Senra (01:36:03):
Motivation. Yeah, it's not going to work. But the way I would summarize the main theme from Andrew Carnegie's book that then reappears over and over again on these stories is invest in technology, the savings compound. It can give you an advantage over slower moving competitors and can be the difference between a profit and a loss. And you see that over and over and over again. It doesn't matter if it's steel, waste management, software, over and over again. It's like the best entrepreneurs, the best CEOs, the best executives, they're not scared of technology. If you're scared of it, you're going to get destroyed by it.
David Senra (01:36:34):
They embrace it and they invest heavily in it. And again, the benefit I have is like, I'm reading about a chocolate company that was started 80 years ago, and they have some of the most advanced robots making chocolate. I'm reading about a tire company from 150 years ago. They watch their costs and they're very efficient in how they spend their time and their money, but they invest heavily in technology. No one thinks of Walmart as a technology company. But if you go back in 1979, right, Sam's in his 60s, and they're like, hey, we're doing everything by hand.
David Senra (01:37:08):
Our business is way getting way too complex. We have all these distribution centers. Think about the logistics. You would know all this. Moving all this material where it needs to be at the right time. We need to invest in computers. And Sam, at the first, thought he heard computer, he heard overhead. He heard expense. I can't do that. And then he was slowly allowed himself to be convinced by the counts of people on his team. And he wind up, and when he decided to invest, he didn't dabble. He invested $500 million in 1979. Who knows what that would be today in the most advanced computer system to handle his logistics and distribution.
David Senra (01:37:41):
And that was an edge that not another retailer on the planet had, or at least in America had, that he had the technological edge over the rest of his competitors. In business, you always want to be finding waste, because there always is some, and eliminate it. You always want to find inefficiencies, and there always are. Want to reduce them. Technology helps you with that. Walmart's a big tech company. So my chief supply chain officer came out of Walmart. Very, very sophisticated guy. It's all about technology, all about using tech in order to get the data and then being very data-driven.
David Senra (01:38:11):
I would argue that if anybody, I don't think you could be the leader in any industry and not also, we don't think of them as tech companies because we think tech has to be like Google or Facebook. It's like, no, they're all tech companies. I just did, I wanted to do more than just like American entrepreneurs. Because, you know, we have an outsized share of entrepreneurs, America. Everybody's like, you should do more XYZ. It's like, why are they all American? And I understand that. And my point being is like, if you think about entrepreneurship in the market economy, it's only a couple hundred years old. It's like, well, America's kind of dominated.
David Senra (01:38:42):
So it makes sense if 75 or 80% of my episodes are about that. But I did one on one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Europe named Amantio Ortega. And I didn't know anything about him. All I know is that... His HM? Zara. Oh, Zara. Inditex. Inditex. Yeah, yeah. And then you're reading about this, you're like, it's not a fashion company. It is a technology company. What does that mean? He built the logistics and the system to say, me and you can walk out on the street right now and we can see, oh, there's a trend here where all these ladies are wearing dresses with whatever, you know, red flowers on them.
David Senra (01:39:14):
And he can take that idea and put it through his system and he can have manufacture dresses with red flowers in eight, you know, 25 different countries in seven days. That is technology. He says, it's like we're a technology company with a chain of stores attached to it. So Zara Inditex is a big customer of GXL Logistics, one of the companies we spun off from XPO. And GXO runs a lot of their warehouses in Europe. And it's exactly what you're saying. It's e-commerce. It's trying to do things very efficiently and very quickly and very accurately.
David Senra (01:39:44):
And you need technology to do that. You need robots and you need AI. Every business, every single business is going to see more automation and more AI. People have to get on the program on that, or they're going to be dinosaurs. 100%. I'm going to go back to Fred Smith. He says something that sounds Fred was into tech. Oh, of course. I mean, in a big way. Yeah, of course. He's always talking about this new invention he just did in the removing packages and robots. And we were trying to figure out some way you could use automation in LTL, because he was a big LTL. FedEx is the biggest action LTL, and XPO is a big LTL. The automation is not there yet to get because of all the closed spaces and all the people still involved in that.
David Senra (01:40:19):
But it's going to be. Package, you have automation now. Package automation is much further ahead. Yes. So there's something we haven't touched on. I have a question for you. And this is a quote from Fred in his biography. He says, you have to be absolutely brutal in the management of your time. Oh, yes. Do you have any insights? If you want someone to disagree with that, you're going to have to talk to somebody else. I'm curious how you... 100% in the case of the budget. I'm curious how you do this, though. So time. So when you're a CEO, when you're an executive, you only got two things. You got time and you got capital. And how you deploy that time and how you deploy that capital equals results.
David Senra (01:40:55):
So it's your time, and it's the time of the people, the organization. So when I was running XPO, we had about 150,000 little more employees worldwide. See, each one of those work at the senior manager worked long, long hours, but the average worker worked eight hours a day. So you had eight times, but 1.2 million hours a day of work getting done. If you've got people very focused and very motivated and very well trained and feel good about the company and feel good about their job, that productivity of that 1.2 million hours a day is going to be a lot more than if the conditions I just mentioned are not are not present.
David Senra (01:41:34):
So managing people's time, putting them in the right priorities and ranking what people should be spending their time on is very, very, very, very important to success. Now, how do I spend my time? I spend my time deliberately and consciously and intentionally on the things that I think make most amount of value for the company. How many things at any given time are you having to focus on? No, a fair amount. So if you're a CEO, you're managing 15, 20 different things always. You're managing people, you manage technology, you're managing budgets, you're managing investors, you're managing infrastructure, you're managing transportation, you're managing logistics, you're managing pricing, you're managing procurement with the vendors, you're managing customer relations, you're managing sales, you're managing Salesforce excellence.
David Senra (01:42:19):
There's about 20 things that are your life. Like that's what a good CEO does. The problem with a lot of CEOs is they've come up through just sales or operations and they're good at that, but they kind of just delegate the other 15 things. That's really part of the CEO job. You look at the great CEOs. The CEOs have created a lot of alpha, a lot of shareholder value. They've been in each one of those 20 or so things. You talk to a Dave Cody, or you talk to an Ed Breen, you talk to Larry Culp. You can talk about any of those 20 things, and they have things to say, and you can learn from them.
David Senra (01:42:51):
You talk to CEOs who haven't created a lot of value, who are not really good at this game. They'll know four or five or six, even half of those 20 things, but they don't do the other. They don't do the other part. You got to be in all of them. But you're not in all those things in equal measure. Some things you don't have to spend as much time on. The people things and compensation things, I actually spend a lot of time on. So that's core. That's critical to get right. That's something that if you get wrong, you waste it. Budgeting, I spend a lot of time going on the budget. Customer satisfaction, I spend a lot of time on that.
David Senra (01:43:21):
The employee service, the employee engagements, going out to the field, doing the town halls, doing the Zooms. I'm all in on that. But when you say that the CEOs that you think might not be doing the best they could, are they delegating too much? Yeah. They're not, they're afraid to do the, I'm making generalizations. There's always exceptions. But generally speaking, what I find is they gravitate to the stuff they like and that they're good at, and they kind of just don't do the stuff that they don't like or they aren't very good at. And you can't. You've got to be, if you want to be a good CEO and have a high performing, performing company and being the top decile of stock performance, like United Rentals and XPO were both top 10 stock performers last decade.
David Senra (01:44:04):
That's not random that both those companies were, because it was the same principles, same structures. You've got to have CEOs, and they did, that are in the whole thing. Understand from A to Z what running a business is and how you create shareholder value and see the whole picture of the levers. So I always tell friends who are port, and I have a lot of friends who are portfolio managers or analysts on the buy side. I say when you bring a management team in, you need to ask them, what's your stock price going to be five years from now?
David Senra (01:44:36):
And what are the levers that I have to believe that's going to get you there? And if that CEO tells you, that's a great question, I'll get back to you. Short that stock. At least don't buy that stock. Because that's the first thing a CEO has to know. First thing is a CEO and the senior management team has to know with great specificity, here's where we are right now, the stock price. We want to get massive outperformance and get to here. That's great. That's just the beginning. Here are the levers of how I get there. Here are the levers of the things that we must do as an organization that will improve our profitability, improve our multiple, generate free cash flow.
David Senra (01:45:14):
Just how are we going to get to there? And in my case, it's not that hard because when you do the graph, the first two bars when you do the levers comprise the vast majority of what you have to do to create the value. And those are buying companies right, meaning being very disciplined in what you pay and looking at lots of acquisition candidates at the same time so you don't fall in love with any one of them. And so you have alternatives and you don't. What's the distribution there? So you've done over 500 acquisitions throughout your...
David Senra (01:45:44):
My teams and I have. I like to give credit to my team. Yeah, you're your team, for sure. So you and your team have done over 500 acquisitions. You've looked at how many? Thousands and thousands. I mean, many thousands. Like 100,000? Do you think it'd be that? I've lost count. I don't know if it's 100,000. When I say, look, looked at in-depth. Yeah, yeah. But in the thousands, many thousands. Okay. Going back to the time management, though. I think, especially in the age that people are growing up in, like, where there's a shortened attention span, a lack of focus, in my opinion, and like really easy to give into distraction.
David Senra (01:46:19):
Like, how you sound like you're almost not impervious to distraction. That's not the right way to put it, because I know how you're going to be humble when you describe yourself. But how do you avoid being pulled into things that are not prioritized? So many, many people know Warren Buffett. I barely know Warren Buffett. I've met him a few times, but he's not a close personal friend. I wish he was, but he's not. But I know a lot of people who are close to me who are close to him. And most of them have the same story, so you must tell this to everybody. He tells people, I'm the richest person, I'm the wealthiest person in the world. And they say, well, Ms. Buffett, you work for one period of time, but I think you're number four or whatever.
David Senra (01:46:52):
He says, no, no, no, no, I can prove that I'm the wealthiest person in the world. I say, why is that? He reaches in, he brings out his daytime or his calendar. And he says, Monday, I have one appointment. Tuesday, I have no appointments. Wednesday, I have no appointment. Because he controls his time. He controls his time, and he has no problem saying no and refusing people time. I think I have a problem saying no, though. Like, this is why I'm asking you to get a better person. Well, you can solve that problem. That's a problem you've identified. That's great. That's half of the solution of the problem. He has that great line where he's like the difference between successful people and really successful people.
David Senra (01:47:25):
It's really successful people say no to almost everything. So like you have 20, you know, whatever the numbers are. Yeah, so whatever the number is, like you have 20 things that, you know, you're focused on it at the CEO level at this moment. You know, you know, where you want to spend your time, what you're best at. We talked about incentives and then recruiting talent. But like, you also are one of the most, and you're not going to like this, but like one of the most famous and wealthiest people in the world. You have an unbelievable amount of people that want your time. How do you stay disciplined? Like, you seem to be disciplined from the outside of saying no to a lot of things.
David Senra (01:47:59):
Like, how, is that something you learned in the last like five years, ten years? Were you like that when you were younger? So first of all, I'm not that famous. I'm well known in the business community. In the business community, I'm not sure. That's the only community I care about. No, the average person, yeah, for sure. And I'm not one of the richest people in the world. There's many people who are vastly richer than I am. But in my own modest way, I've created some level of recognition and some of the wealth. And more importantly, you should see my inbox when it comes to you, but that's fine. That's fine.
David Senra (01:48:29):
Well, I appreciate that. I just need context. It's funny because people... The way you said it is a little grandiose. I don't think I don't think I am. This is why every time I say these things to you, you say things like that. Well, because I want to correct this. I don't want to get Grand Deaths in the wrong. No, it's a smart move. But the funny thing is when I did the, I had breakfast with Brad Jacobs episode. Now people are like, Flood, like, can you introduce me? Like, no, like, you had to figure out how to get to him yourself. Like, you can't. So when I was researching after XPO, I was looking for my next thing.
David Senra (01:49:00):
No, no, excuse me. After United Rentals, I was looking for my next thing. And I was looking at asset management. And I went to Chicago and I wanted to get an appointment with Ken Griffin. Yeah. Who now I've met, now I know, and he's a neighbor down in Florida. I don't know him well enough. And I think he'd return my call if I called him. But he would turn on the meeting. He wouldn't take the meeting. I said, wow, that's kind of humbling. But you can't even spend an hour. He says, no, Ken is a very, and I think you interviewed him, right? No, not yet. I did it. You should. You definitely should. I want to meet him. I want to meet him.
David Senra (01:49:31):
So if you can introduce me, please. He could be president of the United States. So this is the good thing about when I do, remember, most of the people I study are dead. When I do episodes on people that are living, this is why I was asking you some of the questions because I'll do this episode. It reaches a very valuable community and they're really helpful. And then I get all these crazy stories about this guy's even more remarkable than your episode. And I got it about you and I got it about Ken. And then I was like, oh, I got it. Like, I definitely want to meet Ken. Ken's in different league united. Ken is like way, way up there. He's a very fascinating person. Oh, just you should definitely do something on him.
David Senra (01:50:03):
You asked how I manage my time. So I have a chief of staff. He used to work in the Oval Office and manage the most important person in the world's calendar. So he's always very, very good. And more importantly, he understands what I'm doing. He understands my priorities. And he understands what I was talking to you before. Like the two most important things that I got to do are have organic revenue growth, better than the competition, and a margin expansion. And everything falls. He understands that. He understands that in order to do that, I have to focus on people. I have to focus on technology.
David Senra (01:50:33):
He understands the different levers to do that. He understands. So you run every decision between those two. Yeah, that's my framework. In business, my framework is, because I've learned if I do those two things, and it takes 100 different things to do those two things well, but if I do those two things well, I will create dramatic shareholder value. If I buy companies at significant lower multiples of profit than I trade at, Monday morning at 7 o'clock after we announce the acquisition, I've already created alpha for my shareholders.
David Senra (01:51:04):
That's a nice way to start the week. Number two, if I then double the profit over the next three to five years, then I'll get a nice multiple. And if I generate, those are the two main things I need to focus on. And he understands that. Now, what he also understands is all the components because in the monthly operating interviews and all the correspondence, we're very good at communicating with each other what's important and what's not important. So he knows my priorities and therefore he's a great gatekeeper. Is there anybody that could tell you when you're getting off track from what you're professed to say?
David Senra (01:51:34):
Everybody's everybody around me. So if I'm spending too much time on, like, I'm going to catch heck for being on this podcast. Dude, you're the man for doing this, by the way. No, I love doing it. And it will also get to, like, I do think, you know, one of the things that you obviously accomplished with the book, and like I try to help amplify with my work, it's like, just millions of people are going to benefit from your lived experience. You have 40, 50, almost 50 years, let's say 40 years of experience as an entrepreneur. It's like how many people that have ever lived life that have done that. Most people, you know, unfortunately, they quit or they fail or whatever the case is.
David Senra (01:52:07):
Like you have so much to teach the world. Can I comment on something about the time? Yeah, go ahead. There's a phrase I used to use. You brought it on to me, so I'm going to start using it again. I've used it recently. It's Watwam. What? W-O-T-W-O-L-A. Okay. Waste of time, waste of money. So when people are brainstorming, let's do this, let's do that. Someone can say, Watwam, everybody does, that's a waste of time, waste of money. Like, how does that, how does what you're suggesting we do influence directly or even indirectly growing organic revenue growth or increasing the margin.
David Senra (01:52:39):
And if it doesn't, what whom, it's a waste of time, waste of money. You only, you have limited time and you have limited capital. You've got to be directing that time and deploying that capital to things that have the greatest returns. Otherwise, it's Watwam. And I'm so glad, first of all, it's hilarious. I'm glad that you said that you actually have other people around you doing this too, because I am kind of skeptical that no human can hit their goals and what they want to do, you know, 100% of the time. I can't imagine, you know, the complexity of running FedEx.
David Senra (01:53:10):
And this guy's just like, no, you have to be brutal. There's like that. He picks the absolutely brutal is the word. Absolutely brutal. And I manage it. Yeah, I think there's a lot of thing. There's another thing that Fred Smith said that, again, like when I'm reading about Fred, when I was going through and rereading all my highlights from his biography, I wasn't really thinking about Fred. I was thinking about you. This, to me, feels like a lot of what I've learned from you. And this is a direct quote from Fred. He says, I believe that a man who expects to win out in business without self-denial and self-improvement stands as about as much a chance as a prize fighter would stand if he started a ring battle without having gone through intensive training.
David Senra (01:53:47):
Natural ability, even when accompanied by the spirit to win, is never sufficient. If I look at the way you were building businesses when you were 23 compared to, you know, you can pick first million dollar company, then you look at the second or the third or the fourth or the fifth or the seventh. It's like, you're not even, like, you'd go back and kick that dude's ass because of all the stuff you have learned since then. Well, you do get better as you keep with experience, like in anybody, in anything. But the principles are pretty the same. If you look at all my companies, the essential concepts are the same, that you want to have fantastic people, that you want to have rules of engagement with those people where you get along and go kill the competition instead of killing each other.
David Senra (01:54:27):
That you want to have fair compensation so that everybody's in on the action here. When did you kept repeating that? When did you understand the power of incentives? Because you talk about compensation incentives a lot. Very, very early, very early in the oil brokerage days. Because I used to have, we had tables, like 10 brokers at a table. And every month, we pay people monthly. I'd meet with everyone and say, look, we made so much this month in the bonus pool. What percent do you think you contributed to it? And then I would add it up. And it would always come to like 300%. Never added up to 100%.
David Senra (01:54:59):
So I had to have these difficult conversations that people said, look, you know, you're inflated with how much things are like that. But what I realized very early on is people are coming to work not because they love me. They might love me. I might love them. That's not their main motivation. The main motivation why they're coming to work is to make money and make money for themselves and more often to make money for others, to make money for their families, for their spouses, their kids, or whoever. And that's important to understand the motivation of the other person is really, really important.
David Senra (01:55:29):
It's called theory of mind. When you understand, and a child gets that after a few years, they don't have it at first. And there's been a lot of psychological studies done on that. It's important to look at things from what's motivating the other person, what's driving the other person, what's important to that other person. That's good in deal making. That's good in compensation. That's good in building teams. That's good in customer relations. That's good with vendor relations. You need to understand their point of view. You can't just be in your mind. You can't just say, here's what I want. Here's what's important to me. And I'm a bully. I'm going to go get it. Because people are just going to stick their tongue out.
David Senra (01:56:00):
They're going to turn away and do something else. You have to have a partnership. You have to be trading with people all the time. You've got to be figuring out what will help them, what's good for them. And how can we make money together? Not me at your expense. You're at my expense. But how can we go conquer the world together? I think you're a faster learner than me because I don't think I ever thought about incentives. I think episode like 97. So this is probably like six years ago. I'd read, that means I read 96 biographies before this. I get to poor Charlie's almanac. And he's really the one that got Charlie was the one that really put into my mind about how important this was because I thought he was one of the, I still think he's the wisest person I ever met and probably one of the most brilliant people.
David Senra (01:56:41):
And he said something fascinating in that book where he's like, I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort my entire life of understanding the power of incentives and how it drives human behavior. And there's not a year that goes by, and he's probably in his 60s when he said this. There's not a year that goes by where I don't underestimate the power of incentives. And he would repeat over and over again. You show me the incentive, I will show you the outcome. Remember, I told you a few minutes ago that I give everyone on the top level of the company a bunch of equity, but it's locked up at five years. So I meet with my CHRO, who's fabulous, regularly, usually twice a month.
David Senra (01:57:13):
And she shows me a spreadsheet of how much the equity is going to be worth at $50 a share, $75 a share, $100 a share. And I look at that, I look at the numbers, and I say, okay, this person has something to work for. This person's on the team. This person, that's something that I see them working really hard to get those numbers. Or I see, gee, you know, somehow or another, we messed up the comp, and maybe we've got to top the person up. Or, wow, I can't take anything back, but maybe I gave too much equity after whatever. But at least I know where everyone's head is at because I know what's in it for them. You know, there's always that joke. I listen to radio station WIFM, what's in it for me.
David Senra (01:57:46):
And people are generally, they don't care about you and me, David. They care about them, which is normal. That's capitalism. That's free markets. That's a good thing. Yeah, I don't feel it's a negative thing at all. It's like we're all self-assessed. But I do think you have a great line in the book where you're like, money, he's like, I built businesses all over the world. When you have 150,000 employees, they're spread throughout. People like, oh, it's all different cultures. It's like, oh, guess what? Money animates people everywhere. For the whole point, you have a great line in the book. Like, they're not coming to work to make Brad Jacobs more money. Not at all. They're doing it for their families.
David Senra (01:58:17):
I love this idea of, I think it's really important to have a, and I think it's tied to your obsession with like the public markets too. And what you said in your book about being very proud of building wealth, not just for yourself, but for school teachers, pension plans, nurses, firemen, and everything else. So like the importance of having a mission bigger than yourself. I think like if you just live a completely selfish life, first of all, you would have stopped way a long time ago. Like you didn't need to, in general, people you wouldn't have to do this. And I've seen this in a couple different places where like Jeff Bezos, we talked about him a few times today, where his idea was when he started Amazon, he's like, I want to build the world's most customer-centric company.
David Senra (01:58:56):
So I want to be an example, not just to our employees and our customers, but to other companies to see, look how you can, over the long term, you can align the interests of the customer and the shareholder perfectly aligned. They just have to be done so over the extremely long term. But this idea of like going, it drives me. It's like, I want to build wealth, you know, so my kids are proud of me. And I show them like what it's like to chase after something and be deeply committed to it and be passionate about and love it. And also make something that's better for other people.
David Senra (01:59:27):
And if you do that automatically, you know, the family will prosper and everything else. So I think that's like, I think that was one of my favorite parts of your book. Do you know, I think Amazon modified that mission statement. Now it's something with employee engagement too. It's something about workplace, great workplace environment, something like that, the best workplace environment in the world. It is funny when you think about it because it's one of, I have this conversation actually last night. I went to dinner with our mutual friend Patrick O'Shaughnessy. He texted me this morning. He's like, make sure you say teleportation. Best like the best.
David Senra (01:59:58):
Yeah, 100%. And he was with us. We had breakfast here a few months ago, and we were having this discussion at dinner with his family. I was like, what is the most impressive company built in our lifetime? And so me and him were born in the 80s because it's like, what about Microsoft? Microsoft is in the 70s, like it was before us. And I would say it's like, for me, the answer is like Amazon. Like, it started in 97. Like, I can't think of another company started in the 90s, like, in terms of as impressive as what Jeff has built. By reading your book, listening to your interviews, talking to you now, you kind of, for me personally, like, you kind of remove any self-imposed limit that I have.
David Senra (02:00:37):
Where I'm like, oh, like, there's no, I don't think Brad has a limit to what he thinks he can achieve. He thinks on a big scale automatically. Like, you just, you operate in a very big and ambitious way, where I think a lot of people have like self, there's like self-imposed ceilings that are most likely invisible in many cases, right? If you want to build more wealth, you want to grow great companies, just find more customers to serve. Like, it's pretty straightforward process. But I do think one of the things that I absolutely love is, and it's the way I ended the episode, it's the way you ended the book. And I would summarize what I'm about to say here as go all in, you only get one shot at life.
David Senra (02:01:10):
And I think this is a perfect spot to like wrap our discussion. And so I'm just going to read from your book to you. And you said, the summer after eighth grade, I attended the Rhode Island Governor's School for the Gifted in Art Music, a summer enrichment program for kids who've been nominated by their schools. I wasn't sure what to expect. On the first night, I was captivated by a speech given by one of the leaders. I remember goosebumps rising on my arms as he spoke. This program is a special opportunity, but it's up to you to take advantage of it. You have a choice. You can waste the next couple of months and not accomplish that much, or you can go all in.
David Senra (02:01:42):
This is an opportunity to go deep on a project and do the best work you've ever done, but you have to decide if you want it. I learned what it meant to go all in. The magical connection between intensity of focus and the end result. This is to me the punchline. I love this. If I put my whole heart and soul into a project, I had it in me to create really cool stuff. You talk about the passion and going all in and the advice that you'd have for other people listening to this. I'm reliving the goosebumps.
David Senra (02:02:14):
Literally, physically, I'm feeling the tingling of my sensation because that was at a critical moment in my life where I understood that it's up to you. You can diddle-daddle through life and just kind of sleepwalk and then die. Or you can live life. You can embrace life. You can have big dreams and go all in and find your passion, which for most people is not going to be business or making money, but whatever it is. That's what it is. And really achieve something fantastic. And for me, that's a big motivator. This is a perfect place to end.
David Senra (02:02:45):
Thank you very much for writing the book. Thanks for taking the time. Brad, I really admire you. I've learned a lot from you. And now I'm very humbled and privileged to call you a friend. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. All the best. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Please remember to subscribe wherever you're listening and leave a review.
