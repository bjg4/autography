# My Conversation With Tobi Lütke, Co-founder & CEO of Shopify | David Senra

## Transcript

David Senra (00:00:02):
One of the things I admire most about you is like you've been running your company for 21 years, something like that. I love people that do things for a long time, people that chase excellence, that try to be great. My entire life is founders, right? So during the day, I read biographies of History Screen's founders. I've read like 410 of them. And then at night, I hang out with founders. I don't think I have a single friend that's not an entrepreneur. And then I'm always asking the founders I most admire who are the founders they most admire. And your goddamn name comes up over and over and over again. And what they talk about is that you have very unique ideas on company building and management.
David Senra (00:00:37):
And they use the word singular a lot. So I want to kind of like lay out how you think about building companies, building products, building technology, and then spreading the gospel of entrepreneurship. I want to start with one thing that you said. You said companies are technologies themselves. What do you mean by that? In a lot of ways, take the social angle. Companies are social technology in the sense that they allow us to go all in. The only time you're really allowed to spend eight, I'm going to say eight because that's the right number to say, really, like fucking 14 hours a day, right?
David Senra (00:01:14):
Just singly pursuing a thing is like, I mean, we want kids to spend this time in school, and that's okay. And then university, you know, dedicate yourself. Other than that, like, you can't just not have a job, but just be like really into things. It's socially not acceptable. So company building turns out to be a perfect excuse. Once you call it a company, it's not like tinkering around anymore with your ideas. And you get to explore things. What a company fundamentally allows you to do is just run the counterfactual to the world you see around you, right?
David Senra (00:01:47):
Like you get to try to build the thing that you think ought to be there. And then you means test it against the market. And if the market agrees with you that this thing needs to exist, it moves energy in the form of money back to you so you can do more of the thing that you were pursuing all along. And not only that, it's like self-financing. Like if you find out, like again, I started a company which I didn't think was going to be like have its very, very big market. And along the way, it just like the market told, like, pulled Shopify out of the project I started, essentially.
David Senra (00:02:22):
You know, that's an incredible intelligence to tap into. So you put all these things together and you say, like, well, look, companies, the concept of companies, not that old. It's like we are on a 500-year run and sort of kind of extracted from things called companies, which weren't, which were actually more like quasi-governments, like the East India Company. And so the modern company is not that old. I find that if you take that mindset, that like companies are just sort of a path-dependent solution to social and somewhat legal problems, they allow thousands of people to join your project.
David Senra (00:02:59):
And it's called a job, and therefore everyone accepts this. And obviously, you can make money, so it's a good deal. And then you can figure out if this counterfactual of yours might be correct or needs updating along the way or any of these kinds of things. And you could, at the end of the day, if you are lucky, you work with other people who are really all in and like inspiring and taking it further than you ever think. And just like the wall thing is just like, I just like, I marvel at the institution of the company in a way.
David Senra (00:03:30):
Like, because if it wouldn't exist for some reason, and someone would propose the whole idea now, it would sound insane. Like, from first principles, none of this makes sense, really. Well, I heard you say something that was fascinating. It really piqued my interest when you're like, we do not know how to build companies yet. All companies are terrible, including mine, which you said, and that's hilarious when somebody's you're running a 200 billion plus dollar company, and you think that in the next 20 years, we're going to look back at what we were doing at this point and be embarrassed by what we were doing.
David Senra (00:04:03):
Why do you think that? Because it's like everything else. I'm sure when you listen to your first podcast, you're like, oh, please do it. Please don't. But honestly, this should be seen as the most joyous of moments. You should actually do it if you haven't done it. No, I do it all the time. Okay, good. Because the difference between that and what you would do today is you progress. And as a computer programmer, I experienced this all the time. I looked at old code and I was like, what the hell? Like, this is terrible. Why would I ever do this? It's way too abstract and complex.
David Senra (00:04:35):
And I made it better because I now have the skills to do so. And one of the saddest days of my life was when I opened old code and I was like really impressed with how good it was. It's really the saddest day of my life because I'm like, holy shit, the implication of this just hit me like a train, right? Yeah, you weren't progressing anymore. Exactly, it figures because I wasn't programming all day. I was like, trying to build a company instead, which honestly is very, very similar. This is one of the things Daniel Eck told me about you. Yeah. Here's what I observed.
David Senra (00:05:06):
Like you, I read a lot of books. I try to figure out, like, you know, I think someone, like, if you don't read books, you live a lifetime. If you read books, you live a thousand, right? So it's. I'm going to interrupt you real quick because I took notes on this podcast six years ago. This is the first time I came across you. And you said, books are the closest thing you'll ever come to finding cheat codes for real life. You can access the entire learnings of someone else's career in a few hours. It tracks, doesn't it? Yeah. I dedicate my life to this.
David Senra (00:05:37):
Of course, I'm going to agree. Absolutely. I mean, you know, Pretty supposed to agree with me, but I really think we need to shout this more from the rooftops. The one weird trick seems to be just read books. And it kind of doesn't matter. Just make a habit of reading books and ideally change JIRA every three books or so, at least for one book. And then that alone will give you a range that you can draw on for basically everything you'll ever do. So like, look, I read lots of books, lots of them, you know, just like, you know, especially when I went from programmer to a business, like realizing I have to just learn business really quick.
David Senra (00:06:20):
I got really dismayed with quality of business books pretty quickly because frankly, I think the business books are largely written by the people who have time, well, not the people who actually built companies, frankly. So you read between the lines as well. Depends on, like, if a person who started a company or a person writing book is a salesperson, every problem can be solved with sales. If a person is a marketer, clearly every problem can be solved with marketer. And I mean, at least that I can take away as a trap to not fall into, right?
David Senra (00:06:52):
So I was determined to not be the engineering type founder who is going to see everything as an engineering problem. Because that would be called blindness. And that's what kept my capabilities. So I really tried everything, including just how to build the team in such a way that I delegate everything and I have my different business lines and arrange things. This is sort of after the IPO. And I realized I have to be a very serious public company CEO.
David Senra (00:07:24):
And so it almost killed the company, honestly. How did it almost kill the company? It was actually COVID that saved it at this point. I had the inclinations that something was really, really going poorly. It was a time you didn't have a lot of competition, which is also really, really hard for businesses. It's not a good thing at all because, again, you don't get, you don't have a good rivalry, and you can't sort of, like, even if something seems really good, you don't know because there's no one else to keep you honest about it.
David Senra (00:07:54):
You have a distinction between a competitor and a rival. You think competition is one thing. Rivalry is really good. I mean, it's the same, but it depends. It's a mindset change. I think if you, again, if you compete with another company, like there's a lot of, we need also a version of what they have, copying, like you do the Xerox strategy very quickly. Companies tend to get obsessed. Like there's companies which have very, very, like, the most active channel in their Slack is there is a competitive analysis channel where people just bring everything everyone else is doing.
David Senra (00:08:27):
And I think that while that has some merit, I think the problem is it makes companies very reactionary, right? Like in the arts, part of everyone's art studies is fine arts. You copy the great pieces, like you make copies of great books. Your next painting is not at the quality of a van Gov. You just copy it. So mimicry is actually not an excellent way of getting to excellence.
David Senra (00:09:02):
And companies end up falling very much into this. Whereas if you treat someone like other companies in your space as rivals, much easier to have a positive outcome there because rivalries inspire you to be best. Like Agassi could not have been Agassiz without Sampress being there, right? Like, and he very, very clearly states this in his book. The Sampress that existed during the Agassiz area that Agassi understood wasn't a real person. When you read Sampress's biography, he just liked tennis.
David Senra (00:09:34):
Yeah, and Augusti hated it. I guess he hated it. And so the rivalry he created for himself created him in a very real way. In the last dance, which I loved, Michael Jordan, he admits that he might made up a slide at some point, which to me is one of the most profound moments. Sometimes I play the last dance in the background while at work. It's my favorite documentary, my second favorite one. So much sense. The defiant ones about the partnership between Dr. and Jimmy Iveen, the multi-decade partnership. That's the description.
David Senra (00:10:04):
That's not what it's about. It's one of the best documentaries about entrepreneurship. Interesting. Hip-hop rep history is incredibly entrepreneurial. So we just recorded with Jimmy Iveen, who's the star of the documentary, two days ago or whatever this was. I don't even know what day it is. And that's exactly what he said. It's like they understood the business of music before anybody else. That makes perfect sense and totally tracks. You can see it from the outside. It was the first category of music that just killed it on Shopify. It's like they're just so like opportunity is converted into products like that.
David Senra (00:10:39):
And they made different. It was really, really cool. This is a beautiful thing about Shopify. It's a front row seat to just seeing how high agency the different industries are and how quick they absorb new ideas. And it's just like, anyway, it's like a different topic. Almost like in video game, like a god-level view of entrepreneurship because how many entrepreneurs on the Shopping package? It's like millions, right? And you're drawing insights for your own work from the entrepreneurs on your platform. One of them we'll talk a lot about today was the importance of differentiation.
David Senra (00:11:12):
But I want to come back to that. I want to go back to like, so you were thinking, okay, right after the IPO, I'm going to approach everything. This is like an engineering problem. I'll be cosplay company, a public company CEO, like 60-year-old gynosuit, like legal background, right? Like that's sort of what everyone emulates for whatever reason. And it just worked really poorly for me from a product perspective. A company did fine, right? All the way through. COVID happened though. And I'm like, okay.
David Senra (00:11:42):
So what my company needs here for me is like five different things. One of them is all plans are invalidated fundamentally. Like everyone who has a plan, just please throw it out. We need to go and like go through everything we are doing and rederive it because again, everything is based on a very long tree. Like you start with axioms and then you make a huge amount of decisions on top and then you get to a conclusion and that means this is how you spend your day to day building this thing because of these things.
David Senra (00:12:13):
If any variable along this way is invalidated, what you should be doing is rederive the entire thing on top, right? Like you should always pool back the decision tree all the way there and go forward. People not being able to go out of their houses. It's one of those things. Like I don't think we all knew that was a core assumption we had that people could just freely move around in the world. But we got told that we can't do this anymore. And it ended up being quite long during COVID, at least in California and Canada and some places.
David Senra (00:12:44):
So we need to redirect everything. And that was kind of clear to me and sort of what I, you know, that's how you structure your computer program, frankly. I went through the entire roadmap and what I've figured out is, first of all, that was really, really hard to get. And people were fighting, even like very much resisting, talking about everything that's going on. And I found out why, because like, it has just a lot of boondoggles going on. There's just like random projects by random people that I would never have found out about. Why did you not know that was going on in your own company though? Because the company was like, let's say, like four or five thousand people.
David Senra (00:13:17):
You know, it's sort of causal distributed. We started an autoware Canada. We had Toronto office and Montreal office and so on. And so it just turned out that in the Toronto office, there was a fairly big project to build the features to add to Shopify so you could use it for running a supermarket because they decided that the supermarket industry is very large and we should go and capture 1% of all it like in the Dilbert Covex. And so, you know, and frankly, I'm not saying those were wrong decisions.
David Senra (00:13:50):
The sort of really surprising thing about building a business or just in decision making in general is that making the right decision is actually child's play usually. Like you can make wrong calls, which end up because the world changes end up being wrong call later and so on. That's a different thing. But like most of the time, if you like the bad options in front of you, just prune themselves away. They just don't make sense. They're too expensive or just like off mission or whatever.
David Senra (00:14:21):
The problem is, and I think school unfortunately accidentally drills this into people, is that there's one right answer is sort of what people think. And once they find a right answer that could plausibly accomplish the goals that they set out, they go with it. But that's like, well, there's probably hundreds of great answers. And one of them is like far less work, far more, especially in an engineering project. Like the best solutions are always modular and components.
David Senra (00:14:55):
You build one thing and it will work with everything else you did. Lots of the bad software that people use are things which are just like hairboards inside, where like none of the pieces fit together and a huge amount of code has to be written to extend the new thing, make it usable from everything else. And I'm not going to bore you with both kind of details. But if you look at the project brief, the team killed it. Probably everyone made their bonus. They delivered the thing. It just is like an island upon itself now that after it's delivered, nothing else in a product works.
David Senra (00:15:28):
So you were looking at things as like cross-playing, like a CEO or business person, as opposed to an engineer. I was trust-falling. I was like saying, okay, cool. You seem passionate and you seem to know what you're doing. I trust you to do the right thing. And when I hear, obviously, we're going to keep talking. You give me updates on things. People learn pretty quickly what are the projects that I'm interested in, taught me about both and nothing else. People learned how to direct my attention to the things that they wanted to have my attention.
David Senra (00:16:00):
So how did you fix that? The moment I went through absolutely every project I did myself took like many, like 16 hour days. I canceled probably 60% of the projects. And over the course of a year, I turned over every one of my executives. Like this is basically the consequence of this because I just realized that in many cases, the core skill was, well, I mean, I don't want to be unfair, right? Like, it's just that trust was broken in many cases. And in a real crisis like COVID, again, COVID was hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.
David Senra (00:16:31):
Hardest time of my life, for sure. And in a crisis, if everyone is a one before, some people go to zero in a crisis. Some people go to 100. And I found it's almost unpredictable. In fact, if I would have been betting before COVID about who's going to be contributing the most, I would have been wrong, I think, entirely. Why do you think that is? I've been thinking about this for a long time.
David Senra (00:17:01):
And I still haven't gotten a good answer. I don't think they would have known. This is the interesting thing. I think a real crisis tests you in a way that nothing else does. Nothing prepares you right for it. I think at the end of the day, the thing that I have found is people who can adopt the fastest actually quite self-identify. And now I would be able to predict it. Very simple. Have you started a company before? So Shopify is by a founder, by founders, for founders, causing more founders.
David Senra (00:17:34):
It's a celebration of entrepreneurship. We believe entrepreneurship is glorious. And people who reach for it are heroes and doing modern day heroics, go on a hero's journey with lots of naysayers, overcome incredible odds and lots and lots and lots of headwinds. That conviction runs really deep. Sometimes we buy companies, of course. Many of the people we purchased are still at Shopify. People don't stay for a very long time because I think it's such a place for founders and for high agency people.
David Senra (00:18:06):
So I always had a Slack channel with all the founders of companies that we purchased. I did a founder offset with them once a year. Because I find their advice just to be so good. They all have been responsible for people's livelihoods. And that changes you. So I went to the founders channel and said, guys, I need help. This place is, it's crazy here. Had you already started turning over your executives? Yeah, once I realized that, I was like, and it wasn't like one moment. It was just like. How did you know that instinct to go to the founders channel and ask for help?
David Senra (00:18:39):
I think that in a moment of like, where the fuck do I go? Who do I have most in common with and who can actually relate to the types of problems here? Because again, my relation to Shopify is different, right? Like I started it. It's just like, it's different from everyone else. But the second best thing is talk to people who have had this type of relationship with the thing they created. You know, I asked a lot of the founders to become my executives. In some cases, I took people from individual contributors in an engineering team and put them in charge of a very large thing.
David Senra (00:19:12):
You know what? Every one of us textbooked. And it was like really remarkable because it really fed into an intuition I had anyway. And what I found is during COVID is the founders of company were actually not doing well because they were like similarly managed. They were like irritants. What does that mean? They don't settle. They talk about absolutes. If something is shit, they say so. It doesn't matter if everyone has agreed to move on or something. It just nods on them in a way that's deeper than this other thing.
David Senra (00:19:45):
And that's exactly what you have inside of you. Exactly. And so I feel like this is a very special thing. And it's companies reject it. Companies cocoon them. Sometimes they find they give outs. Good, like the skunk work team. It's like, just like it's daycare for people who otherwise tell you that your stuff is your shit doesn't smell, right? And shit does smell. So once I'm like, no, you don't get to put them in like founder daycare.
David Senra (00:20:16):
I'm going to put them right in front of you, like in fact, on top of you. So, you know, the difference that made to this business is nuts. And so this is what I'm saying, COVID saved Shopify, because I needed to take a move that was like very much, okay, I built this company, I got to this point. It's important. It's actually maybe even more important during COVID than before because it was kind of like for millions of small businesses, their livelihood for this time and only way to make livelihood. And I'm super proud of what we did because I think the businesses that started in Shopify and came early like actually grew and did better doing that.
David Senra (00:20:53):
Some of them grew faster than you. You said somebody beat you guys to a billionaire. Which is the craziest thing. Which businesses ever raised their customers like that started on the platform for it's the greatest. I love this thing. And so I mean, again, like they're fantastic. They're heroes. They're glorious. They're wonderfully disconnected. My founder made my customers have the same irritation with my software. And like, they tell me, like, it's perfect, right? It's exactly what I want. And so this was one of those moments saying, you know, what, Toby, like, like, maybe you didn't build Shopify completely by accident and your intuition might have been actually helpful.
David Senra (00:21:28):
And cross-playing someone else is probably not what you need to do. So. At that point, you were running Shopify for how long? 15 years. No, it's, yeah, about. So that you were 15 years. 15 years. This is very common biographies. I think it would surprise people. Like, oh, why did it take so long to figure it out? It's like, no, it takes a long time to actually build the skills. And then the important thing about intuition has to be refined. Yeah. So it's like, maybe in 2005, you shouldn't have been trusting your intuition. Trust your gut is sometimes good advice, but it really depends on your gut. So it's like no one is born with intuition for building businesses.
David Senra (00:22:03):
Because first of all, building business is completely, every decade is different. Like some problems are persistent. Like I laughed. I listened to, I think, the episode you did on Larry Ellison. You were describing his frustration with problems in his sales team, which literally I had to. Like it's like, you know what? I didn't actually have to live that horror. I could have actually, like, if I would have read the right if you read software and biographies. Then it's our listener founders, yeah. But the incentive problems are commercial teams. But that's an amazing part.
David Senra (00:22:34):
I'm glad you just, you picked it up. Because he's like, I'm fucking embarrassed. He's like, I'm 40-something years old. I've been running this company forever. And I didn't understand that incentives with my sales team mattered. And they almost destroyed his company. They almost went out of business. I usually listen to podcasts when I'm sitting in my racing simulator to practice for an X-Race. And it got to that point. And I had to like, okay, I have to stop and just listen to this because I'm just feeling so much empathy for Larry Ellison about people. How funny he's less. So anyway.
David Senra (00:23:06):
Because I love where you're going. I can't help myself because you know this. It's like when I hear you saying, like, I'm getting rid of the executives. I'm going to build an executive team of founders. That's not a new idea. Rockefeller was doing that 150 years ago. It's interesting how the building blocks that largely Rockefeller invented. I mean, we call these things trusts because it was, you know, like that was a term they first used there. Toby's relentless dedication to improving his company reminds me of my friend Kareem, who's the co-founder and CTO of RAMP.
David Senra (00:23:42):
Kareem is one of the greatest technical minds working in finance. I spend a lot of time talking to Kareem, and every single conversation centers around his obsession with crafting a high-quality product and using the latest technology to constantly create better experiences for his customers. Like Toby, Kareem believes that nothing is ever good enough and it can always be improved. Kareem is running one of the most talented technical teams in finance and they use rapid, relentless iteration to make their product better every day. So far this year, Ramp has shipped over 300 new features.
David Senra (00:24:14):
Ramp is completely committed to using AI to make a better experience for their customers and to automate as much of your business's finances as possible. In fact, Kareem just wrote this. AI is all I think about these days. It is our duty to be first movers and push limits so we can make the greatest possible product experience for our customers. That sounds a lot like the approach Toby uses. Both Kareem and Toby never rest on their laurels and use rapid iteration to invent new products for their customers.
David Senra (00:24:45):
Many of the fastest growing and most innovative companies in the world are running their business on RAMP, including Shopify. Make sure you go to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business save time and money. Let AI chase your receipts and close your books so you can use your time and energy building great things for your customers. Because at the end of the day, that is what this is all about. Building a product or service that makes someone else's life better. That is what I'm trying to do. That is what Toby has dedicated his life to doing. And that is what RAMP has done too. Get started today by going to ramp.com.
David Senra (00:25:17):
So now you have the executives. You're going through the most difficult point in your life. Yeah. And you realize, oh, I'm cosplaying. I'm going to go lean into my intuition. This is another thing why I think that decision you made six, seven years ago, however long it was, is why so many founders study you, respect you, take pieces of like your philosophy as well, because you're like, god damn it, I'm just going to do this the way I want to do it. I was like, okay, I need to try something different. Like at the end, you have to do things differently, axiomatically. Like obviously axiomatically, if you do the same thing, you get the same results.
David Senra (00:25:48):
Differentiation requires new ideas. Instead of figuring out, like spending the next 10 years of my life figuring out how well I can cross-play someone else, what would the company look like if it just taps entirely into my intuitions, like in my biases? I'm doing literally the opposite now as I did before because this didn't work. So maybe opposite works. And worst case, I triangulate the midpoint between those things. So enabled by the very clear, fast, and obvious success of asking people from Founders Channel to step up and run a company with me.
David Senra (00:26:25):
My real set of intuitions here, again, intuition is your entire life's story rolled out for you to make a snap decision in a moment. What does my intuition say about what the company actually should look like? Like, let's forget about the path to patents. Let's go full tabular razor and go up from Axioms. And I started with really, really, really nothing. Like, I started a project on GitHub, literally. So engineering tools, my intuitions again.
David Senra (00:26:56):
What is the first principle of a company? Like, what is like, what are the inputs? What are our decisions? Like, put in config files, what titles exist? What levels exist? How, you know, I asked for all the sales, like compensation data, all the market data, and put them into the repository. I turned them into machine-readable files because they got them as PDFs and so on and so on. So I built a thing that then created, like at the end, had all the information to create a model of the company.
David Senra (00:27:34):
Like literally, this is Python code which takes configuration files that we agreed on, things like how many people should report to a manager. All these bits, and then computes them uses something called a solver, like a stack solver specifically. And then with all these constraints, all these inputs, what should Shopify look like? What departments exist, what level exists, how many people are there in which group and everything. And of course, the first version very utterly incorrect. And then I realized. Are you doing this alone?
David Senra (00:28:05):
I started it and then I got like two, three other people in it to help me with this and really, really got into it. And so this is called Shopify OS, this Shopify operating system. It's really not very part of Shopify now. What it did is it became irrefutable that we didn't know all the principles. We had like something, there was 8,000 people in a company and it was 5,500 different titles in a company.
David Senra (00:28:35):
And it's like, so, I mean, some of them are just senior and senior staff, but in some groups, senior staff was lower than director and some above. And it's just like, it just, when I tried to make something software addressable and try to reproduce it, it showed every crazy, unviable choice in the company very, very easily. So there's a system in engineering, not actually a well-understood part, but I think it should called desire state systems. And what desire state systems are is a thing where you say, okay, here's what should be.
David Senra (00:29:14):
You hold that up to what is, like you click on a website on a link and your React library behind it. What it does is it says, okay, I compute what it should be. I see what it is. And now I figure out what is the minimum amount of steps I take to get this to that. And that's what you see on your web browser. I need a desire state system for this company. So we have this model, we create it, and then we hold it up to the company. And the job of HR is to be this reconciler. Like, how do you take with minimum steps to get from here to there? Or change what we have in this system to approximate what we actually want.
David Senra (00:29:50):
So this is very technical. Here's the effect of it. Think about how much politics this removes. Then my head of sales comes to me and says, hey, I need 50 new. Salespeople, I can put this now into the system and says, Well, that means you have to either make these changes or you're gonna lose some of your engineers, or like because the system, based on our agreements, recomputes everything. So, I have, um, we can always look at the counterfactual, and then it's not like, yes, boss agreed while playing golf to hire 50 more salespeople, and now someone has to carve, like you have to find a pound of flesh somewhere in the engineering team, and suddenly you don't actually work on innovation anymore because you never actually made the decision to not hire engineers because your budget doesn't allow anymore because but you did make a decision to hire salespeople and maybe this is the right decision, but now we can actually look at the consequences of every one of those things.
David Senra (00:30:42):
So it was hugely successful because it just created such a legibility for us and such a simplicity. It also just told us that so much was undecided. Like for instance, we took the concept of in engineering, this was already around individual contributors as a really, really excellent career track, right? Like you can make as much money in good companies as an individual contributor as you can as a VP or manager or like the best paid people in many companies are now individual contributors at this point in history, especially in machine learning, like at least in the machine learning labs like OpenAI.
David Senra (00:31:21):
But no other discipline really had that. You had to become a manager to progress in your career. And so I think one of the consequences was that when I really looked at like, hey, I need more great engineers, the best place to recruit them from was my own management team. And like, that seems silly, and especially because we are there actually great managers. They're really well respected because they're good engineers. So maybe, but like, don't they want to code? Like, it's like, and you know, so we created like this sort of mastery system, we call it, where every job has this ability to stay.
David Senra (00:31:58):
You can get these basically level upgrades frequently. And at any set of responsibilities, you can, if you're insanely good at it, you can make lots of money. And like, that just seems like, of course, you decide it like this. Why would you not? Wait, so they can stay individual for the future. Yeah, like take an example in engineering. If you're insane, like if you're 100 times better than other people in this discipline usually, you can make more money than a vice president. Now, that depends on the value you can bring, but it is possible.
David Senra (00:32:30):
And just like, I kind of hated the way we did compensation in the industry, right? Like, again, these are boring topics. No, it's not, they're not boring to me and to the people listening. Wait, why do you hate the way that they were doing competition in the industry? What I love about entrepreneurship is the level of responsibility, personal responsibility people take. I said as much earlier when we talked about the founders who have been responsible for people's livelihoods. It changes you, it does, right? Like, so like, I don't work myself well in an environment where sort of like everything is pre-described.
David Senra (00:33:01):
I don't like joining other people's games and so on. All these kind of things are my biases. And again, we're implementing my biases here. So in COVID, like this is 2022, I think, or 21, suddenly Shopify went down 80% of stock value. Again, I didn't think that was a problem because I think the stock market is basically like polymarket, it's sort of a betting market on a future value, right? Then you guys are wrong when you just bet at betting.
David Senra (00:33:31):
Like in fact, so I work on a real market value of a company, which you guys are betting on, but I don't know. So there's such a discrepancy from the way I see people talk about stock price and how I or have ever worked inside of companies this is perceived. But what was going on in your head when it drops by 80% though? Well, I'm like, well, my head I believe because I'm like, you know, I mean, we have a stock. You believe? Yeah, of course. Because of course, that's not a normal experience.
David Senra (00:34:04):
I was like, I was not about to raise money. I did I had enough money in a bank. I'm German, so like I don't take debt like much and so on. Were the internal metrics strong? You thought they didn't desert, you didn't do that. Yeah, unit economics are amazing. However, like at the I don't, I don't want to say this right, but I honestly don't remember the exact numbers. Like at the high point of our stock price, I think we were trading at beyond 50 X of revenue and stuff like this. I'm like, yeah, that's not exactly value investing here, right?
David Senra (00:34:35):
Like guys. And so I get it, like. But you weren't worried about the fundamentals of the business. No, but like what when it is 50 times revenue, I see it as my obligation to do that. Okay. Right. Like it's my like my job. My job is to build the best company I can. The betting market says that I can deliver that kind of thing. And I'm like, yeah, maybe, but you go give me a moment here. Like, I need a moment here for doing this. The reason I bring this up is because, again, everything I talk to another entrepreneur and I just run it through this, whatever the hell's in my head from all these books.
David Senra (00:35:08):
And when I hear you talk about that, I think of the time when Amazon stock, he took Bezos talks about this in his shareholders. It went from something like, you know, 180 down to six or 120 down to six. And he's like, yeah, but they were focused on something else. I saw the actual fundamentals of the business and I was like, this thing's going to work. And so eventually... Because I think Buffett always repeats that thing where in the short term, the stock market's a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine. You just want to build a heavy ass company. And he's like, and Jeff's like, I'm building a very heavy company.
David Senra (00:35:38):
Amazon will be a heavy company. So I'm not worried about this short-term drop by 80 or 90%. That really tracks. And so, but like one of the effects was, and this is right, like, well, people got stock options at the level up there. And they rightfully say, well, how about it? But like, it's like, even if you say, like, okay, well, I'm super game here to get us back there. Like, this is going to be, it's going to take doing, I realized the psychological problem with everyone being so underwater and having to spend years getting to basically the zero point where the stock options are worth like even a penny again.
David Senra (00:36:16):
And of course, they were like, well, but that's the company. Like the company gave me those things at the time. It's like I received them. I was passive in this interaction. Therefore, the company has some kind of responsibility to kind of make me whole here. And I think that's actually, you know, I mean, I not necessarily see it this way because the risk was there and like these kind of things. And like, again, it's like other people voting that's causing this price. I didn't set it. However, I do receive a point. Like they had no agency in the process.
David Senra (00:36:48):
So we rebuild our compensation system to completely work for opposite of what everyone else does. We give people, here's your annual salary. Here's an internal system. You go in, you look at it. This is the number. Now you get sliders. You can say, how much do you want in stock? How many do you want in RSUs? How much office do you want in shop cash actually? And how much do you want in cash? And you can change that every quarter. It's like you decide how much money you want. And you can even use a couple, like a tool that's able to lock in the value of the stock you receive for three years.
David Senra (00:37:22):
It's like, again, sometimes orthodoxy can come back on the table if you get there from good principles. Like you can actually join Shopify and get exactly the same stock option deal that companies get at other places by using the tool we give you, but you have full agency and you make this choice. The consequence of this compensation system is kind of beautiful because what happens is, first of all, it's super predictable. Second, if you go stock and the stock appreciates and you hold them, you make more money. If the stock goes down, you now get more stock options in your next quarter.
David Senra (00:37:56):
So it's rebalanced against the actual value every quarter. So it works really, really well. It's very popular. It was kind of hard to do because doing this worldwide with people in many different countries was kind of a legal nightmare because there's all sorts of rules around how to change around changing of salaries. We figured it all out. So we have a blueprint of how people want to do it. It works really well for us. But we're kind of proud of it because it's just like, again, it's a point of differentiation and we believe it looks much better.
David Senra (00:38:27):
And again, I want people at the company to also feel like this is a company that is like never sleepwalks into anything. We are deliberate about things. When you started this, I'm going to do it my way. I'm working with the founder executive team. You were in the process of that and the stocks dropping? No, it was already there. Like that went sort of 2020, 20, early 21 project, I think. And then I think the stock market man did that change, like 21 late. VCS are totally running together for me because it just was, I mean, there was no weekends.
David Senra (00:38:59):
There was no, I can't remember who said this. I was talking to a much, I talked to a lot of older founders. I'm obsessed with like, people think I'm obsessed with old people. It's not that. It's like this guy's got 50 years as a experience as entrepreneur. Turns out they know some shit. They've seen some shit. Surprise. Yeah, and he's just like, man, you're going to remember the beginning of your company. You're going to remember the end and like so much in the middle is going to, he said exactly what you said. It just like blurs together. Yeah. So you're saying you should document it more. I totally agree. Lots of years are totally running together. I have reasonable record keeping on this.
David Senra (00:39:30):
So I and especially with all this AI-led agentic reprocessing of nodes and press and so on, you can actually reconstruct these histories and timelines. And I'm fascinated with this right now. So my understanding, though, like you thought you're now looking at running a company as an engineering project. That's right. So I'm like, let's engineer a company, be a company engineer. This taught my team. That applies for every single department in, like, do you engineer marketing? Do you engineer? Everything. Everything.
David Senra (00:40:01):
I require my executives to, I mean, at least tell me, but actually do it. Go to a podcast, some international conference, and talk about how Shopify does the thing the conference is about differently and why that's better. If they don't have a good answer for how they're doing this right now, how they would, that's what I'm working on with to crystallize that message. And there's a couple of reasons why I do it this particular way that we can get into the public psychological.
David Senra (00:40:32):
But it's also I study the brain quite a bit and the main conclusion you get to about the brain is really that the brain is a retrospective narrative alignment mechanism. It's actually terrible record keeping, but it mostly attempts to take the most salient version of our self-identity and reconcile the history with it. And it sort of rewards you for actions that are directly congruent with this identity.
David Senra (00:41:10):
And it dissuades you from dissonance with your own identity. But you can actually change your identity quite a bit. And that actually makes this whole process work for you significantly. What do you mean by change your identity? Like the way you view yourself? Literally affirmations work, right? Like affirmations work, which is the dumbest trick that works. I'm so glad you're saying this, because people from the outside are like, this guy's like very logical, engineering. But you're all about intuition. Now you're talking about affirmations. You're speaking to the choir, just so you know. I'm a toolmaker. I always project very idealistic, but I'm actually not that idealistic.
David Senra (00:41:42):
I'm super, I'm like a craftsperson, toolmaker person. My entire life was making tools. I literally, I job for as a tool. I make tools very often for toolmakers. My hobbies is making tools for engineers who are people who make tools, right? So it's a fraction. My life's a fractal of toolmaking. It's all about toolmaking aesthetics. It's all about the craft behind it. But also not because of craft for its own sake. Although I appreciate that too.
David Senra (00:42:13):
But even that's not for idealistic reasons because appreciating the craft behind the tool making happens to be pragmatically an excellent way to get really good at pruning. Everything is about outcomes. What's the affirmation prototype? The affirmation that if you tell yourself or write down 100 times something about yourself, that writes it into the neurofrontal cortex at such a deep level that your brain will start reconciling you to that. It just works.
David Senra (00:42:44):
I've used that very often to like I, you know, like I was terrified of public speaking until I just sat down for like a week and every day I spent like 10 minutes just writing, but I like public speaking. I love public speaking. You wrote that down. I know, yes. And now you love it. Yeah, like a week later, and I knew it's not, this works when you know what you're doing, right? Like you don't even, it's like, it's not like a placebo. It's like, it's actually like you just actively change your neurofrontal cortex in this moment. So I use this often.
David Senra (00:43:16):
I sort of write to myself, message in a bottle, these kind of things. That's sort of a different topic. But like, it's so the point is, like, I think. What's the topic there? Hold on. You write messages to yourself. Yeah. Affirmations or just... No, it's just like generally when I feel like something is like, hey, there's something I've figured out that I really like. I know I have to write a scheduled message to myself to remember it because I need space to repetition on the idea. What's an example of that? I mean, for instance, like you have a company keynote kind of thing, like a company get-together summit once a year and for onto four weeks.
David Senra (00:43:53):
And so usually I did a keynote there and like then I write a message in a bottle to myself with what was good about the process, what was bad about the process, what to do next differently, and all the topics are left on cutting board just so like to get a head start. So that's a random example of that. How did you learn this? That you could change identity, that affirmations work, that writing these things to yourself. I think trial and error, but I think the hints are like everywhere, right? Like it's, I mean, affirmations are one of those things. I mean, there's a reason why we like society creates rituals, right?
David Senra (00:44:27):
Because rituals end up being largely affirmations on repeat, right? What do you think of visualization? Like, so manifestation, these kind of things, probably works too. You know what? The funny thing, I think everything works. If you just do it, the question is what's effective and quick. It sounded to me before, like, I started doing reading all these biographies. I was like, this is some willy-foo-foo nonsense. And then you see very smart, analytical, logical, many case, inventors and engineers, and it appears over and over again.
David Senra (00:44:59):
People that know each other, they worked in different industries, different times, lived on different parts of the planet, and they all talk about doing this. And it's parallel construction. They all come to the same conclusions in different words. And so, yeah, I personally, I mean, in the Swift department, I'm extremely take my historic philosophy. Control what is under your control, know what is, and then do the best possible job. It's the job is the thing. The whole project in life is just try to become very, very good at something and ideally cultivate some significant skill, create potentially service products, and then share them with as many people.
David Senra (00:45:39):
You do this because that's what you're on platter for, right? Like it's like do things that matter in the world that are under your control, but also sign yourself up for, like, it's okay to sign yourself up for most interesting places as long as you remember what your job is within them. So in this way, like I love the current times and I love the technology industry. I have a role inside of it, which is like I'm taking care of millions of entrepreneurs and small businesses that are trying to use the world of technology, use the word of retail through their own work then, self-actualize.
David Senra (00:46:22):
And that is a worthy goal and worthy job. And so like, you know, AI comes out and I'm like, people are like, well, should I start an AI lab or whatever? Or should I like, don't you want to work at OpenAI? And it's like, I mean, everything would be interesting. But you know what? What's really cool? Pursuing the same problem in a changing landscape, right? Like now I get to reinvent everything I've already done. How fun is that, right? Because I really care about these problems. Anyway, back to the affirmations and sort of the brain sort of self-gymnastics.
David Senra (00:46:54):
Going to my team and just saying, look, just tell me what you will talk about on stage is bad. It's like afterwards, you need to internalize this as something that you have committed to me. Imagining, I imagine that's something that care about, they care about reconciling. And so maybe I have to do it, you know, because otherwise they said something untrue to me, right? And like they don't see themselves as someone who says untrue things. And therefore, you can actually make the reconciliation work for your own benefit in this kind of way.
David Senra (00:47:28):
It also just means like it emphasizes like difference. Difference is so important. It's so like orthodoxy just really needs to be off the table from the beginning of a project or like from the beginning of decision making. Have you ever studied James Dyson? Not enough. If I can only recommend one book ever, it's his first autobiography. But he has a crazy line about this. So this is also very common with great entrepreneurs. And you hit on your earlier talk. She's like, well, if you want to, I'm trying to chase excellence, trying to do the best in the world or make the best tools possible. Therefore, that demands difference, that path, that mission I'm on.
David Senra (00:48:00):
I can't do it. Literally, it can't be the best if it's the same. Just think about this. And so like Edwin Land, who's Steve Jobs here and the founder of Bolaroid, he had a personal motto. He says, my personal motto is very personal and it may not work for you, but he said it is don't do anything that somebody else can do. And he just would not. I'm not making a Me Too product. But the reason I bring up Dyson, because now he owns one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world, right? But he's writing that book when the business was fine, but he had one product in like one or two markets. He was doing like 300 million a year of revenue. Not a bad business, but a very small business compared to the size that it compounded to over the next four decades or three decades.
David Senra (00:48:35):
And he says in that book, even at that time, he's like, differentiation and retention of total control. And he goes, he goes, you make it different, even if it's worse. That's one of the craziest sentences I've ever read. I totally agree. It has to be different, even if it's worse. I completely agree. I see it all the time. Because, again, it gets back into the copying of a painting problem. Like, you can make a seven out of 10 solution to everything by copying the seven out of 10 that are already out there in the market.
David Senra (00:49:05):
But if you make from Doubler Razor's axioms your own version of it, you have mastery over even if this is a six out of ten, you can iterate on this. You can take this past the seven afterwards. Like, so very often, especially in technology, the word belongs to the fast, the people who iterate, the people who adjust, the people who understand what's costly and what's unnecessary and will prune away the rest. And I find actually probably net, like pixel for pixel, the most inspiring picture that I think exists that I've ever come across is the SpaceX Raptor rocket evolution.
David Senra (00:49:48):
Like, have you, do you know what I'm saying? I use that as an image for the Dyson episode I made. It's perfect. Exactly. It's perfect, right? Like, you look at this and say, yeah, that's... Like that, that's that's today's Picasso, right? Like it's just like this is this is it. Like this is if we're not in a point of time where the great works and the masterpieces are being done by one person, they are done by teams. Very few teams can move forward by subtraction. That is like does not exist in industry usually.
David Senra (00:50:18):
Very, very, very rare. So it's beautiful in that way. You have to do things different. You have to make them your own. You have to have mastery over the first version if you want to take this far further. I mean, this is, we talked earlier about the podcast I do inside of a company called context. And it's about that. It's like, how did we make the decision? It's like everything around a decision is more interesting than a decision. Is this podcast constantly updated? So it's internal, only for Spotify. God damn it, only for Shopify. I mean, especially when we talk about podcasts, that makes sense.
David Senra (00:50:50):
Well, they have, it's funny, I looked at my end-of-year app on Spotify, and one of the podcasts I listened to the most, which was shocking to me, was they have the internal company history. It's called Spotify, a product story. And it's because, you know, everybody else, I think, one of the reasons that we have a mutual friend, obviously, and Lulu, she's on your board. And the importance of telling your own story. We went to dinner tonight and I was like, Lulu, what I love about you is like you're repackaging old ideas. Like Napoleon told his old story.
David Senra (00:51:21):
Julius Caesar told his own story. All these people did it. It's a very valuable idea. And so everybody was trying to tell the company history outside of the company. They're like, no, you got all this stuff wrong. We're going to make it ourselves. And it's like, I think a 10-part podcast. But they originally, I think they built it for themselves. And then they didn't know about this. I love us. You should listen to it because it's narrated by Gustav, who was head of product, who's now co-CEO. And they take it in chronological order. And so if Sean Parker played a big role at the very beginning, right?
David Senra (00:51:52):
He's obviously not there now, but he's on like episode one or two. And then they interview the people that made the decisions. And that's the whole point. Like we were making, think about all the crazy shifts. They had to go from desktop to mobile, all the things they had to deal with. Well, just go listen to what the company did at the time. Executives and founders. But not only what they did, why they did it. And why is so much more interesting? Like one of the turns, like the tournament of Toby said, it's real inside of Shopify, right? Like it's like people just throw these things around. Like, well, Toby said, we're doing it this way, right?
David Senra (00:52:23):
Like, and I just try to get people to always ask when. When I said, you change your mind all the time. Yeah, and this is not even, I learned about this because something is like really, really odd and like really odd decisions. Like, there was easier ways available. Like, how did we get to there? And it's like, well, it's like, everyone said that you wanted it this way. It's like, I mean, like, under which context, when did I say this? Like, clearly, we've never talked about this. So it's like, it's a very common thing. What's a typical episode?
David Senra (00:52:54):
It's just you explaining the thinking of what's going on currently in the computer. Yeah, it's like taking people back to major decisions. Are these short episodes? No. Like, initially, we went through phases. There was a sort of for the first maybe 50 episodes, we said like we had a, we have to mix it down to 23 minutes because we calculated that that was the average commute in Shopify. Like, so we checked where everyone lived compared to offices. We ran the data and it was 24 minutes. And so we made it 24 minutes because that seemed like as good, like, we needed a reason.
David Senra (00:53:29):
And you like designing constraints. You talked about it. Exactly. So, you know, just like, well, I also just don't like picking 20 minutes because it sounds good. Like, I want like, I need a better reason. So I might say I want something to be like, 20 minutes sounds right, but let's find an actual good reason why it's 20 minutes. And then we found 23 minute reason. So sometimes you're allowed to just parallel construct the thing you want to do anyway. Then at some point we abandoned it because just like, you know, the nice thing with podcasts is like people can skip move. It doesn't matter.
David Senra (00:54:00):
Like you can just keep going for hours and hours. And do you have any ones that are like long? I think there's one which we had to cut over a couple of episodes that ran like, if you run it for five hours, it's like. What was that one about? That was like the philosophy of engineering with a bunch of our distinguished engineers. Like how, you know, you would not believe how immature engineering is as a discipline. It's just like there's so many good ideas and so many bad ideas.
David Senra (00:54:35):
And it's so hard for people to sort through them in a way that's like way harder than any other industry because it has a weird property. Like software has a weird property. I mean, the best thing and why the business model of software is so insane is because of zero marginal copying of software is free, right? Like it's like you can, you know, we build Shopify, first person signs up, you make money, second person signs up, uses exactly the same thing. It's like, you know, the second instance of it is not the same piece of software. So hence the margins of software are incredible.
David Senra (00:55:06):
The same thing causes a lot of problems for the creation of software because you just don't know how much bad weight is in the system. If you compare this with electrical engineering, there's a very clear cost of manufacturing, right? Like the bill of materials is like the thing that dominates the success of a product because it dominates when the costs, which then dominates the product market fit. It also, manufacturability is a huge component in electrical engineering. It's like, is the board laid out in such a way that it's prone to defects?
David Senra (00:55:37):
Did you choose all the right components? Are there like, is like one chip get really hot next to a soldering thing? But like, you know, I remember the original Xbox desorted itself if you just played certain games too long. So, you know, there's real constraints like this. So excellence is obvious in a way. It's like in the numbers and everything. Everyone's trained on costing waste into the system. Software engineering just throws away so much of the capability of these incredibly powerful machines, partly because it just doesn't cost anything.
David Senra (00:56:09):
However, at a certain scale, it starts costing. But at this point, it's being fixed by operations teams getting more servers rather than engineering teams going back to fixing those things. So the consequences of bad decisions in software engineering are an externality that doesn't accrue back to the engineers who caused it in almost all instances. So it's like a little bit like a factory is polluting the environment. It's just like it doesn't cost back to them.
David Senra (00:56:40):
And so anyway, so therefore, it's a very tricky industry to move forward. It actually quite often moves backwards significantly. Computers got much faster and we threw a huge amount of capabilities away making like these very, very heavy client-side JavaScript applications that took over everything. They were just god-awfully slow and very error-prone and took forever to load, especially in e-commerce where people visit sites rarely. Some of our customers went out of business because they got talked.
David Senra (00:57:12):
They talked themselves into their own stack. They had a CTO who brought in their own team. They used a set of technologies that they wanted to use because they are currently the in-thing that has the most interesting conferences in the most interesting places. Then they deploy it and it sort of works in the demos. But the problem is when you're going to WebSite for the first time, you have to load it all and you don't have an up-to-date MacBook perfect hardware with much memory like everyone has who spoke on engineering teams. You might have an Android device and you might be on a train right now.
David Senra (00:57:45):
You're sitting there a minute and a half for this thing for this online store to load. Guess what the conversion rate of that online store is? Zero. Yeah. I'm quite annoyed by this, although that was a real, really, really, really problem in 2023, especially when I think a bunch of, frankly, us older engineers had to like take the kids to the site and just like have a good conversation. And that was the context of the episode of context. At least that's what led to this particular thing.
David Senra (00:58:16):
I don't know if we actually succeeded there, but like I think we didn't need to because I think I think the world just changed. Like more than zero interest rate phenomena, they're gone. People actually wrote better code out of them. Like it's like amazing how much, like how consequential the zero interest rate, absence of zero percent interest rates actually ended up being. You could feel it in the engineering team being less prone to accepting random waste into their stacks.
David Senra (00:58:47):
It's unbelievable. That's interesting. I don't know if I've heard anybody else make that point. I think this idea of hearing directly from the founder in an audio way is underutilized. I did this episode on the founder of Kinkos. He was dyslexic. So am I. Yeah, I heard, which surprised me. So he, actually, a lot of great founders are dyslexic. It's very common. Yeah, it's very common. So it shouldn't surprise me. So he's like, I can't read your goddamn email. And I'm not, he was also, I think he said he had like ADHD, so he couldn't sit down at a desk.
David Senra (00:59:19):
So his job was like, what do I like to do best? And he's like, I just go around and all the Kinkos at the time were owned by individual people. So it wasn't like one cohesive corporate structure. And so therefore there's a lot of experimentation going around. So he would just travel the country and then he'd spend all his days in the stores and he'd be finding because all these people are doing different trial and error, good ideas. And so what he would do, this is back in the day, he would call into a corporate voicemail. And so he, at the end of the day, he'd give like a three-minute update about all the good ideas that he saw. And then you'd come in as a Kinko employee the next morning and you could play Paul's voicemail.
David Senra (00:59:52):
I love it. And then this is an interesting thing that you might agree with though. After doing this a while, he's like, you're resurfacing all. These great ideas, right? This guy in Memphis found the best way to do X. Why don't you mandate that everybody in the company does X this guy's way? He goes, Because if I do that, that's the best way it will ever be, which kind of relates to what you just said. He's like, Listen, there's probably a hundred different good ideas or right ideas. And if I stop here and don't keep tinkering, going back to that word that you write, then that's the best it will ever be.
David Senra (01:00:23):
If you need something and you tell people what to do, you might get it, or you probably will get it. If you don't tell them what to do, you might get something you cannot possibly imagine if you have good people. And so, this is like actually a really, really important thing. It's much more important to create the environment in which people can be their most excellent self than it is to prescribe here's the precise moves to do. So, how do you create an environment that people can be the best version of the excellent version of themselves?
David Senra (01:00:53):
How did you say, is this related to your idea where you're like, you said something that made me chuckle? You're like, I don't do corporate baby proofing. Yeah, exactly. Like, I mean, exactly. Absolutely, it's the same idea. Like, the baby proofing thing is real. Like, what is internal policies, right? Like, processes, what are they? They are like, do this thing different from the way your intuition tells you to. Okay, why are you wanting people to behave differently from their intuition? Like, let's look at a higher order bits there.
David Senra (01:01:24):
It's like, what other opportunities do you have? Well, you could change the environment in such a way that doing the right thing is intuitive. That's pretty good because now you don't have to post your policy. You could also hire people whose intuition is better honed. They often policies and processes are sort of downside protection. You're trying very hard to make to avoid the people who do things wrong to be of causing so much damage.
David Senra (01:01:56):
That's like the downside protection. But you're also really limiting what the best people can do. So I think in creating an environment almost as a box for people, here's the space, and I want you to fall inside of the space is this problem I need you to solve. Right now, my world, in commerce world, is attempting to figure out what Azure E-Commerce is, how it works, how all the companies are working together, like how the research labs work with everyone else, how to expose product catalogs from the entrepreneurs, how to make sure that transactions can be met, what the large language models need in terms of information to do a fantastic job when people ask them to be their personal shoppers.
David Senra (01:02:46):
That's a box. Inside of this, somewhere, somewhere in it, it's all dark, is the most beautiful solution. What tools do we have to explore this box? It's like, dark. I don't know. I can take a stab at it. I can paint a picture of what I think is good. But that's just like sending people into the room with a couple of tools. Afterwards, they need to make their own decisions. And I want them to do this. I'm not there. I don't want to control every decision. The company makes millions of decisions every day, right? Like in a building like this, right? But what I can make a decision of, help them really want to be on this journey, help them fall in love with a problem and see the potential.
David Senra (01:03:24):
And I can make sure it's the right team and everyone has the right skills. And I can make sure that they know what they have decision power over and like how to, at some point, because people are only willing to take so much risk how to transfer that risk to me, ideally, or to a company, right? In a form of our projects work in phases. A prototype phase is what I just described, where you explore the problem.
David Senra (01:03:59):
Then you think of, like, when you've learned what you need to learn and think you have something that you can build, you make a proposal and you transition out of a prototyping phase. That's a meeting, right? Like that's a, you know, that's what we call like it's a phase transition in our project system. There's software that manages all this kind of thing. They can use an AI to preview what the transition will be like because it's trained on all the other reviews I've ever done.
David Senra (01:04:31):
So they can sort of mock do it and figure out what I will probably say. That saves me a lot of time. And then we have an actual meeting. And then they tell me what we're applying to do, what they've learned. That helps me a lot. And then I say, okay, okay to transition. There's some engineering leads, design leads give OK one. I give OK two. And then they are in a build phase. And then a new phase starts. That's a new box. They have agency to make decisions in there.
David Senra (01:05:03):
At this point, I assume the risk. It's like a trait of accountability for autonomy. And so that's how we found we can almost operationalize this system. Because what I'm finding is like, I mean, all the biographies you read, what you find is, I'm sure, is that the moment of insight, often the product that started all or the artworks that are defining the careers, they were not really coming out of an office building environment, right?
David Senra (01:05:43):
Where someone had OKRs of a precise metric to hit. And then DaVinci probably did not have one Vesuvian man as an OKR given to him, right? Like it's like you kind of have to create a box for them, sometimes a physical space as well. Like he was in an attic that just ended up being where he did most of his creative work, I believe. And so you try to figure out what is this sort of environment in which where excellence and creativity can come together and then collapse it to saying, okay, now the company needs what it needs because we need to make resource allocation decisions.
David Senra (01:06:24):
I mean, you're bringing more people onto a project at this point. There's a couple of sort of things that need to be decided. And then autonomy is regained until the next phase is releasing, at which point we do that review. And sometimes we say, okay, we're not ready to transition because we need things we need to do differently. But that's the way Shopify orchestrates now. These are all things that exist today based on the days during COVID where I reviewed every project and couldn't. And like, well, what should I be able to do if I would be like, if I would be a competent CEO, what would I have put in place so I could do this thing I need to do here in the beginning of COVID very, very quickly?
David Senra (01:07:04):
Given that I wasn't, and now I aspire to be, what needs to be created? And so whatever the answer to that is, we worked hard on. And I think we just discovered some extraordinarily powerful systems mechanisms in this sort of journey. That was the prompt. Like, what would a competent CEO do in this situation? I love to take the view that I'm a corporate raider. And short before I went bankrupt, and I bought it on a fire sale, and I'm like marching in on day one here.
David Senra (01:07:36):
And previous management was crazy. And we need to turn this place around. That's my favorite. I love playing this game every year, figure out what I would do differently. And then it's like, let's go. I have my to-do list. And I asked a lot of teams to do this a lot. It's like when we have systems that just don't work, one of the most powerful, maybe through affirmations, maybe for experience, things you can do is just don't be prideful about the prior book too much. You're allowed to have pride in it, but you want to wake up better every day, right?
David Senra (01:08:11):
You want to version to be better than today. And for that, you have to kind of downgrade what's there. The Suncost fallacy is so powerful. But how is that an affirmation? How does that represent, how do you, when you're actually talking to yourself or you're writing this down, or is this in your monologue? I literally write hit pieces on the past, right? It's just like a hit piece. Yeah, like I just like all the things that are wrong with the thing, I somehow am really proud of you. You are so much like some of my favorite founders, Dyson's like this.
David Senra (01:08:43):
My friend Kareem, who's one of my closest friends, he's the co-founder and CTO of RAMP. It's like nothing's ever good. The way I describe him is just like, no resting on laurels, no sleeping on wins, do something great and then do it again. Steve Jobs said this. He's just like, well, what's the proper response when you make something wonderful? He's like, you do it again. Yeah, let's go. I know that a lot of these, a lot of these great people, they don't really have rearview mirrors. They'll obviously learn from what they did, but they're not like, wow, look, look at my trophy room. They don't think that way. Look, nostalgia was put on death certificates in the 1800s.
David Senra (01:09:16):
It's like people died of nostalgia in their minds. I mean, they really died of something else. I've never heard of that before. It's like we used to know that nostalgia is not a good thing. It's like it was one of the bad indulgences. Now it's barely a vice. So I think nostalgia needs a little bit more scrutiny. Overcoming sunk cost fallacy is one of those things that any path that you can take to get there is going to be enormously beneficial. Well, I think playing the game of corporate raiders a great way to do this.
David Senra (01:09:47):
Exactly. So when you develop tools for... You kind of separate yourself, because that was your decision. You might be like, oh, well, I feel a little sensitive about that. It's like, no, no, that was somebody else's. This is a new company now. So one of the things that is unpopular. But when I do it inside of a company, it's like I really should talk a past, especially if I did it. There's still systems that I build inside of the system. So I like, I don't know. You should talk to the past public. Yeah, I trash, like, like, I make fun of all the ways in this is hilariously wrong in funny ways.
David Senra (01:10:20):
And I need to remind myself, especially when I do a certain area I didn't work on, that like I gotta have to proviso it or like I have I need these like corporate radar like I'm collecting these now. It's almost like distance yourself. And I need to help people not think that what I'm doing is I'm passing judgment on their prior work because I'm not. We are all to like I expect. You are passing judgment on the prior work and not passing judgment on them as a person. This is what Rick Rubin talks about in his book all the time. But it's not theirs anymore once it's out there, right?
David Senra (01:10:51):
Like this is the thing. I can say more about that. They need to disconnect from like the work is collected is the moment the pull request is accepted or the okay too is accepted. You've converted like your craft into something the company is like is in a company's commons. A company is a collaborative project where everyone contributes and there's a process by which it's contributed at which point the company accepts it as being on quality and says like this is now part of you know like my like the company's embodiment essentially so the product you've contributed it you can you you deserve the credit for this and and so on but the company could have had someone improve it at any point of time right it's not yours it's like we don't allow people to use word ownership over parts of a code pace or so um we only allow stewardship as a work uh like just as a as a proxy term because sometimes you need to be able to talk about it in this way it the shopify thinks of itself more like an open source project you're contributing into the commons people talk about wikipedia not about the particular editor of the wikipedia page you know what i'm saying i have a selfish question before you move on yeah so you're looking at all past work you have there's this guy named david olgarvy who's one of the greatest uh advertising agency founders and he says that we have a divine discontent with our work that looks like perfect anecdote to smugness yeah right because he's like you don't want to rest on your laurels yeah i talked to james iceon about this though because he has a very interesting organizing principle so we're gonna take this cup right here this is a product he goes this is organized this entire life he's been a veteran engineer for 55 years now and he's just like i see his product and i say ask myself how can this product be better yeah then i make it better and then i put it then and then i short time after pick it back up how can this product be better i make it better i put it back down and he goes i just he goes i see the bad in everything yes but the interesting part is he's intellectually and emotionally mature enough he goes you have to understand it doesn't like i'm not a miserable person yeah i just look at it as like this is a problem that problem is an opportunity and i want to work on that what is your inner monologue when you're critiquing your past work are you partial yeah no no like i get excited by finding problems like i just like i love uh like i mean look at this point i'm um such a i'm such a long-term veteran of tech company building i love figuring out what we're bad at stuff because like we have a pretty good thing going on like like all by all intents and purposes this thing's working right so um and uh you know when when i figure out what like we're actually bad at something i'm like holy shit like i have an obvious preprint for now how to become a better company now which is like actually my job by craft right like this is all opportunities things go into commons they are being hopefully judged by everyone i get grumpy when things that are shitty are not identified as such and improved um and then i make people go do it and sometimes i do it by um uh trying to create um energy by just like roasting the thing's current state about just like i want i want people to feel no deference to it i don't want people to respect the piece of code that exists and better old system that i want them to improve um and i want people to um um you know just find their sort of energy source because i what i'm asking them is like go into a particular box that contains this problem and do the best possible like better than anything i could possibly ask you right now for solving it because i expect people to um be highly agendic and uh you know fall in love with problems and just like find better solutions than what uh you know industry usually produces and so on right that's the entire point it's unpopular when people aren't in the right headspace for it and it's incredibly effective if they are so um the difference very often is just a couple of words um and a bit of framing and uh i just find that's like that's one of the most powerful sort of tools you pick up i think along um uh you know along the the journey it's like the five words to say at the beginning of a sentence will change everything um my co-founder actually gave me one of those very early which was like probably why i tuned into this kind of thinking and this collecting these kind of uh things because wait what did you mean by the five words you say at the beginning of a sentence i used to go again engineer um that's always like an interesting experience with um uh four of the engineers working for me and um like i i stay pretty current um uh with engineering i still do not a ton of production engine uh um production engineering but like i do um i i sometimes start new projects with people like uh and and the first 20 30 pull requests or commits in many repositories for things that we use uh come from me so like i i like doing this it's it's part fun part i i sometimes need to happen in my craft um anyway um so that's a surprising thing for people um uh of course so my intuition was always like okay well this is not the right architecture for this kind of thing and i know this for a fact because i've built this thing before so let me go to a right um uh whiteboard and just like re-architect this and like and so at some point um and that like now you know daniel my co-founder like explained to me well look you get people pretty defensive then because they just came to show you basically you know what was objectively their best work because they presented it to you and that matters to them so and then you just like it doesn't matter if you go and make a much better system here out of the top of the head um they are like um if i truly ever did this um they're going to be defensive and try to say face so um just put for example in front of every sentence and so like what do we mean and now like i tried this and it works perfectly so instead of just telling them hey uh you know instead of doing this like here's the um um architecture that that you should use just say like i could think of doing this a couple other ways maybe it's something you want to consider for example what about this and then just do it now you're on the same side you know you're on team we are all working together on the same problem i'm just i'm adding input now like everything is the same it's five words or so in the beginning i just find the magic of these five words is uh or not this specifically it's like things like this like just frame things slightly different and life's easier i read something jeff bezel said that changed my perspective on the importance of high quality sleep he said that he makes sure he gets eight hours of sleep a night and as a result his mood his energy and his decision making is improved his point was that you get paid to make high quality decisions and you can't do that if you're sleeping terribly and the product that has made the biggest impact on my quality sleep for years is 8 sleep i'm lucky enough to be friends with the founder of 8 sleep mateo and we live in the same city a few months after i started using 8 sleep i randomly ran into mateo at a restaurant and i was with some friends so i go over and say hi when i got back to my table my friend asked me who was i talking to and i said that's mateo the founder of 8 sleep and my friend replied he looks like he gets good sleep mateo is living and breathing his product i had never had the ability to change the temperature of my bed before i had an eight sleep i had no idea how much that would improve the quality of my sleep i keep my eight sleep ice cold it's cold before i get into bed so i fall asleep faster and wake up less during the night that feature alone is worth 10 times the price there are very few no-brainer investments in life and i believe eight sleep is one of them that is why elite founders like mark zuckerberg and elon musk have all said publicly that they use eight sleep i would recommend getting the pod five which is the newest generation of their signature product it is a smart mattress cover that you place on top of your existing mattress and it is next level sleep tech it automatically regulates your body temperature throughout the night independently for each side of the bed the result is you get up to a full hour of additional quality sleep per night make the no-brainer investment in your sleep by going to eight sleep.com forward slash senra and use the code senra to get 350 dollars off you can try it for 30 days at home and return it if you don't like it but i'm confident you will love it i will never let anyone take my eight sleep from me make sure you get yours at eight sleep.com forward slash senra one of the things that daniel from from spotify i almost said shopify now for him totally be fair he's like you should ask him like what were some of the advantages of starting with alley i think there's just too much cross um pollination you you you kind of have to sync with companies towards like um entrophy creates equilibria and so you end up like with the companies just being very recognizably similar to each other and the activation energy for being very different is super high because that means people come with the wrong ideas into your
David Senra (01:20:00):
Company behave incorrectly, and you have to tell them to behave differently. Where if you're outside of a place like Silicon Valley, where people just move along between companies, I mean, first of all, especially early, I traveled to Silicon Valley a few times a year, but I tried to just take it all in and learn as much as I could. But of course, what I got from everyone was not actually the answers to my questions about how to do things. I was getting the aspirations usually or the highlight reel.
David Senra (01:20:32):
People wanted to seem smart, right? Like, and so they gave me the best vision of what they think the answer should be, or where the corporate company ought to be doing. And so, which is great, because then I took that back home with me three flights and sort of took the ideas that are relevant, tried to always put like a Shopify spin on it. Like, I don't like taking ideas, as you clearly can tell and never did. Sort of like, just like figure out how to localize them to our problems. And ideally try to do something better.
David Senra (01:21:06):
And so, only very many years later, I did I realize I was like, always for my career, I was comparing my an hour average to everyone else's aspirations in highlight reel. And just like that alone is a really, really good thing. And if you then try to do better than that, you know, sometimes like just ignorance is an incredible way of actually just doing better. And so, so that helps the process of having to translate, being able to translate things. Like, we had no one, like, when Shopify IPO'd, we had one member of the executive team who ever worked for a public company.
David Senra (01:21:46):
That's it. Wow. We had no one who took a company public. We had no one who was an executive at a public company. We had one executive who worked at a public company once. And it's just like, I think that's cool, right? Like, it's like, I felt a real sense of compliment about that because it meant we could became our own thing. Our entire motto becoming a public company was, we are not going public. We are creating a public version of Shopify. And so that was like... What's the difference between those two senses? Again, becoming something else.
David Senra (01:22:17):
It's like we don't want to, like, a lot of people are worried when we're a public company, we're going to be different because people sort of expect public companies to be a certain way, at least the people who worked at Shopify did. I felt it was important to be different and do things differently. One thing we did, I think you will appreciate this, is we looked at the requirements. We talked about Formula One. Formula One is funny. Sorry, this is a little bit of a veer, but Formula One I love because it's like there's a rulebook. It's the opposite of every other rulebook on planet Earth.
David Senra (01:22:48):
People read it so that they can comply. The Formula One rulebook is a rulebook that is read so that you figure out how to beat it. And it's like there's no engineer in Formula One has anything to do with the central casting engineers. And new casting engineers actually usually want to get requirements and then comply to them. They're like the people going to Formula One are the people who want to beat the system. This is very important to them. So I count myself as of the archetype of the ladder.
David Senra (01:23:22):
I would have liked being an engineer in Formula One. I like beating the systems, but other people tell me to abide by. I heard a story one time that somebody had hacked your competition system to get more money than essentially they just studied the robot, found this loophole, and you're like, good for that person. And then you'll fix the loophole or whatever the cases, but that's exactly the kind of person I want working for. Exactly. I mean, yeah, especially if it's, I mean, there is a way, I mean, what happens next ends up mattering, right? Like, so, okay, this goes on.
David Senra (01:23:53):
Like, at some point, this becomes, well, you're just exploiting a weakness fully. I mean, I don't want to give too many provisions, but generally, like, people who are like looking around to figure out, like, I never begrudge anyone being an intelligent actor in a local incentive system. That is just like, everyone's allowed. That's pretty much my morality at this point. Like, it's like, or at least a big part of it. You're allowed to do this. I own the incentive system. It's not, you get too much out of the incentive system, or if the incentive system tells you to behave in a way that is not congruent with the company, the company's goals.
David Senra (01:24:33):
That is my skills issue in designing the compensation, not your design. Not their fault for taking advantage of it. But really appreciate it if you give me a heads up. Because we are still the same team here. So maybe you raise your hand at some point saying this is fine. Yeah, not like 10 years later. So back to the IPO, like in the IPO, we just looked for ways how to, like, within the constrained rules by the SEC, where do we have agency where we can do different things? We sort of honed in on the IPO roadshow video.
David Senra (01:25:05):
Like, there's like a horrible video player, the IPO roadshow website. And every other IPO we could find was this, you know, CEO standing in front of a screen, camcorder, and just sort of going through the same slides. We're like, there's no rule for that. Let's do the fucking documentary here. Like, let's go through the history of why this company exists and why it's important. And he said, like, what video can be put onto this space where no one expects it that will somehow hook people in to full screen the video within the first 20 seconds and actually watch the entire thing.
David Senra (01:25:43):
And we heard so much about this on the road. Like, so many people were like, oh, I look forward to meeting you. What you guys did with this video was insane. I didn't even know you could do this. Every IPO after this was like our way. So it was kind of like a nice little moment of putting a bit of agency into a process, which was pretty. I heard this story one time. I think it was like the founder of SiriusXM. I forgot who the person is. But they were like, well, how do you make annual reports? And there's no rules around this. So you have to present certain information. So they made a book. And the book would be illustrated.
David Senra (01:26:14):
And she's like, no one said we couldn't do it. It's like, we're just going to do it our own way. Let me ask you a question, though, because I think I heard you say this as well. You were getting what you felt was bad advice or incomplete advice or maybe advice not from first principles about like whether to go public or not. Some people were saying stay or better. Stay private longer. Yeah, yeah, I get you. The advice was always like, don't. Who was telling you? Other founders? Yeah, founders. Silicon Valley Orthodoxy definitely is to avoid it. And I don't know.
David Senra (01:26:48):
I can tell you the story of our medical decision, but it's just basically it's like, I mean, I suppose I'm predisposed also when everyone agrees with something to take the counterfactual just to hold it up to see if I potentially like it better. I just find plan B usually is a better one. Everyone puts plan B. I think for many, many, many people in bad earth, always doing where plan B would lead to a better experience. It's just like plan B gets the ambitious one.
David Senra (01:27:20):
If this event happens in my life, fuck it, I'm just going to build a company. It's like such a common plan B. That might be what you actually want, but you're lying to yourself or you're scared or whatever. Yeah, and also, again, you are a human being. Therefore, you have, you come, your firmware comes pre-loaded with a problem called the sunk cost fallacy. We just do, right? It's like this, you've got to operate that out of yourself a little bit. You've got to be able to discount what has happened more to make good choices, because otherwise you just chase bad with good money all the time or chase bad plan with your hours in the day.
David Senra (01:28:03):
They'd rather be in a bored, boring, or like even miserable environment than actually change because the fear of change is so great. So wait, so people are telling you. Being private is better. Like friends of mine, like Stripe, running this experiment. Like if they managed what they put off in terms of figuring out how to stay private for such a long time is actually remarkable. I just think they spend a lot of time figuring out how to stay private. And like, I don't think that's the most valuable way to spend time.
David Senra (01:28:36):
So you went public 2015. What were the arguments for staying private longer in 2013, 2014 when you're having these discussions? We were tiny. We had 800 people, Canadian. So they were saying. Yeah, like I mean, when Shopify's first trades happened at, I think, a billion, $1.5 billion valuation, right? Like, so... That's pretty wild that the public market almost got like venture could have got venture if you bought Shopify. Yes, you essentially had venture returns in the public market.
David Senra (01:29:08):
Every once in a while, someone puts together a list of best stock market returns over the last 10 years or whatever. And like, yeah, like I own that list, right? Like, just because I decided to take Shopify, like I did the old school thing. That was normal. That's what everyone did. People went public fast. And by the way, this is kind of important. Like, you know, public market needs to have growth because where else is prosperity coming from for people who don't have like these obvious accredited investors, accredited investor laws and stuff like this, all they do is like make it so that when you're rich, you can invest in private company stock.
David Senra (01:29:50):
And when you're not, you can't. And well, where are the returns? Like, of course, this is such a fucking conspiracy to keep everyone private because that just like requests all the growth exposure to institutional and investors and people who are already accredited. And so I just really dislike that whole thing. I think like, man, like, again, it's about building things and sharing what you figured out. And like people buying a ticket to write the Shopify because they like what they're building is like, please, like, that's clearly what we want.
David Senra (01:30:26):
So I just think the institution of public companies is good. I mean, where my beef is with the whole notion of like influence over companies. Again, path dependence. Like one vote once, like one stock one vote is like, yeah, but like, no. Like everyone who studies decision making knows that you want to move towards like people who have the most context should make a decision. That's like, doesn't say the leadership of a company.
David Senra (01:30:57):
This is literally what I'm talking about, creating space for creativity, because I want the decisions to be made locally on the ground. So were the arguments for staying private back then just memetic? They were just reviewing what everybody else is saying a few. People are generally right. It just doesn't, it washes out. Like again, people have problems with the concepts of like, very often a new idea is dismissed because someone can formulate an idea, like a reason against it. And somehow that dismisses the entire thing. We live fundamentally, most of people spend their entire life, sadly, in a vitocracy, where you need everyone to agree to do something, but you only need one person to vote against it, to not do something.
David Senra (01:31:42):
And again, good companies overcome this in important ways. And so similarly, one good argument dismisses the entire idea is a very common way to evaluate options. What people very, very often don't do is reformulate all the arguments against the status quo. The thing we are doing right now also is flawed. It just we really understand the upsides and downsides. The new thing might have way higher upsides. Or actually, maybe not.
David Senra (01:32:12):
Maybe the upsides are obscure, but like or hard to know for sure. But the downsides are clear and they can be formulated. Therefore, the usual default position is not do it. So this is, I think, is incredibly undisciplined because you need to think in propensities, you need to think in chances. And sometimes you need to really, really laud up a decision for all the pros and cons that can be articulated and make it a little bit in your mind. Look at where the scale comes out.
David Senra (01:32:44):
For a company that's trying to sell the e-commerce platform for everyone, especially for many American companies, being a Canadian private company that's tiny and it's not ideal. So people don't usually go public because of marketing or name recognition, but it's super valuable. Put it on the pro side and then put everything else on the pro side too. We might get better people working for us because some people really want liquid stock. And so on and so on and so on.
David Senra (01:33:14):
And in the end, it's not even close. The downsides were like a couple of annoying phone calls I have to do every couple of quarters, at least for the first 10 years, I suppose. And I thought actually most of the process was actually quite valuable. I learned a lot about my own business having to explain it to others. Exactly. There's been a few previous guests on the show, Brad Jacobs, John Mackey, Daniel Ack, obviously running public companies. In Brad Jacobs and John Mackey's case, they both said like Jacobs makes that point.
David Senra (01:33:46):
Well, one, he thinks it's like wonderful free marketing and advertising. Two, you now have a current, like you have a currency. Mackie said the same thing. Like it benefited Whole Foods being public fast because then he used that currency to acquire a bunch of other competitors and accelerated his growth. But Brad Jacobs' point was just like he likes the pressure of that check-in where it's like, this is what I'm trying to do in the company. This is what I'm saying to the company. And this is our results. And I want somebody to say, oh, like there's a big disconnect here. And I want the pressure to actually perform and have somebody lead these expectations externally.
David Senra (01:34:20):
We talked about the environment that you're building at Shopify. I'm curious about how you think about the talent that's inside the environment. Yeah, of course. I mean, ultimately, I really, really believe in the sort of stoic, maybe Adlerian idea of separation of tasks. What have I control over and what I don't? I always love the particular formulation about thinking about how other people think about you. Like, again, you need to make yourself a person worthy of being liked.
David Senra (01:34:55):
If someone then dislikes you, that's up to them. It's not your job to make people like you. It's your job to be likable. And if they make the category mistake, it's their own fucking problem. So it's a really, really freeing way to think about the world. Talent. My job is to make a company worthy for the best and brightest to work for. This is the part everyone skips. Everyone's like, oh, we need to hire a better recruiting team. Well, maybe you need to also just be worthy of a kind of talent that you would like to have. So, I mean, this goes from office space, if you have any, to company, like the amount of bullshit people have to deal with to how much bullshit politics can you subtract from the whole thing.
David Senra (01:35:38):
And can your large company feel like a small company with lots of resources and lots of impact? It's more fun to ship software to millions of people that you really respect than to a few people who you then try to make a sale for at some point. Or like, it's just like, you know, impact matters. In a way, this is likely going to be misquoted, but I think the talent eventually takes care of itself. There are not that many good companies to work for. They're not meant companies, that many good companies that deserve the attention of people who can be of the most capable people because they have options to start.
David Senra (01:36:20):
There's actually not that many great companies. It's your job to make one of your companies one of those companies that the best people in the world will want to. What are these going to look like, though? The reason why I didn't move to Silicon Valley is because I knew how to create geographical consensus in the Eastern Seaboard that Shopify is the best company to work for, full stock. And I just knew I had the ability to do it because I knew how to build a company that I would want to work for. And I think, given that I estimated I will need somewhere between a thousand people or something like this back in those days, I'm like, I'm going to find another thousand people that think like me about how good a company needs to be to book for.
David Senra (01:37:00):
And I can dislodge all of them. So if I go to Silicon Valley, I can't pay what Google pays potentially, or like someone else makes up for their skills issue by just overcompensating. Yeah, it's called compensation because you kind of have to compensate people for the shit you have to ask them to do. And if there's a lot of shit you have to compensate people for, but you have enormous amount of resources, you can make up for skills issues by money. And so in East Coast, which was much more hedge fundy and much more high-ends and for the kinds of hackers I wanted, I knew how to do this.
David Senra (01:37:33):
Well, wait, I want to pause there. I love this idea where you're like, I'm going to build a company that I would want to work for. Oh, yeah. That's on one end of the structure, which is great. You also had this thought experiment that I heard you say before, which is like one of the worst things that can happen on the other end of the spectrum is you wake up 10 years from now and you built a company you don't want to work at. And then you have this great line I want to pull. It's like, that's dystopian. There's so many companies I wouldn't want to work for. Why did I use my life to build a company to build another one that I wouldn't want to work for? You just should build a company that's worth working for.
David Senra (01:38:04):
Yeah. Like again, you should take pride in your work in the inputs and how you like, did you accomplish your things you set out for in the aggregate, right? Like be easy on the path, but like the outcome should matter to you. And like, man, I just shake my head sometimes with like how people overcomplicate these things. It's just like it's kind of, man, people know what they're looking for, right? Like, and some, you know, I'm talking about very, very, very fortunate people here, like people who have a lot of choices, who have like incredible competency and in some of the rarest skills and like combining this with an enormous drive.
David Senra (01:38:46):
Like sort of you, like there's like a couple of different attributes that all have to come together to be one of those people who can command like hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars of compensation packages that you can make in this industry, partly because you're worth it, right? Like you're contributing more than that to a mission like this, and therefore you can command this kind of compensation. And that's like the way this all fits together. I think of everyone as an entrepreneur, really. Your capabilities, that you are the entrepreneur of your own work output.
David Senra (01:39:21):
Your product is what you can do and what you can accomplish. Your market is for companies that exist. And you are selling an exclusive subscription. That's the institution of employment, right? It's a two-sided opt-in relationship. Whenever people come to me and saying, hey, how do I earn more money? It's like, well, be too good to ignore when we increase competition. Be better.
David Senra (01:39:52):
You're making this amount. You would like to make this amount. In which way have you become so good that you can add the Amount of increase to just like the collaborative project we all work on. And so I think that's just sort of clarifies and simplifies things, right? So I mean, all this said, I don't want to sound it like it make it sound like it's inevitable, but if you just do all the right things, you end up like there's always an information gap and reputation lag. And I'm out there recruiting and telling people about the company a lot.
David Senra (01:40:24):
What helps me a lot is people are curious about the company and have heard about the company and so on now. That is because of things that were under my control. I tell people that it's an unshared attention company. There's no part-time jobs. You will have to put a lot into it. You're going to get even more out of it. We will make great money, but we attempt to never be the highest compensation bit because we have found that the people who optimize for that above all else actually don't do well at the company.
David Senra (01:40:58):
Because Shopify is a mission-driven company. Exactly. And the thing I'll promise is like in terms of your own skill set, partly based demand, partly by osmosis, and partly based on culture that's surrounding you, you will advance vastly faster at Shopify, building capabilities, skills, and correct ways of thinking and mental models and these kind of things than I think at any other place. Therefore, the compound return to your career is going to be vastly higher here than anywhere else because you get to a potentially higher compensation level earlier in your career because you're with it.
David Senra (01:41:37):
The entrepreneurial story is very fractal in Shopify. It's just like, what is your product? What's the market? And does it fit? It's just a clarifier that I think is worth talking about. I'm going to quote David Ogerby again because I think it's interesting. He says, like, talent is most likely to be found amongst non-conformists, dissenters, and rebels. So when I asked the question about, like, hey, we know the environment, we have a description of the environment. What are the people in the environment? There is two ideas I got from two separate entrepreneurs. I've mentioned both of them already, but I like, because they use the same terminology when they're looking for talented people to hire in their company.
David Senra (01:42:10):
Daniel from Spotify and Kareem from Ramp. And they both said the same thing to me. They hire for spikes. So spikiness. So a lot of people, a lot of big corporations, they want you well-rounded. Like, no, no, this guy might be a bipolar alcoholic. Or this guy might, you know, have some other shower. Yeah. Like Steve Jobs, he was hired at Atari. Everybody's like, Nolan, Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, like, you can't hire this guy. He stinks and he wants to sleep at the office. And Nolan's like, yeah, but he's really talented. So he's going to sleep at the office and you just got to hold your nose when he's around.
David Senra (01:42:43):
Do you agree with the idea? 100%. It's like exactly, we never look at the credentials and stuff like this. Again, I'm a high school shopper and it would be like rich if I would start making everyone want to have PhD. The path by which we do it is we go for a life story. We ask you like, hey, give us your story. And it's a very important ingredient in our hiring process. And frankly, what we're looking for is like high agency experience. We look at like something went wrong in your story at some point. Well, now let's zoom in.
David Senra (01:43:14):
How do you react? Give me a minute by minute. This is what we don't know, right? Because a lot of us are entrepreneurs. Even everyone, like I talked about the founders of companies you purchased, but like most of the people just in general in Shopify entrepreneurs, many started Shopify stores, built a business and then fell in love with a company and applied for a job and got a million. So this is a huge amount of company building background. And we want to be surrounded by people we admire. That's, I think, the biggest product any company can deliver to their employees. It's that every day they are surrounded by people they deeply admire and can learn from.
David Senra (01:43:48):
So it's a very important part of this. So lots of entrepreneurship, lots of entrepreneurial impulses. And then so we looked for this high agency behavior. And then, you know, obviously, did you drive a particular craft that you're applying for to excellence? How do you think about this kind of thing? Can you just sort of talk about the excellence or actually perform it? And then, you know, this is really what we fill our buildings with.
David Senra (01:44:18):
And, you know, just like, again, create the space then, and that would be creative. And this sort of, this is how it always works. And it's worked really, really well. We couldn't do anything other than this in the beginning, right? Like in the beginning, we had no money, like really zero. I didn't take a salary for four years. I heard your father-in-law covered your payroll when you couldn't make it. That's right.
David Senra (01:44:49):
So yeah, we were living with my parents-in-law, Fiona, my wife's all the bedroom, from which I also added, I put a key desk and I built a lot of Shopify from there. And, you know, like, I mean, just kept cost low. That was the main thing. Make every dollar count is something that's, I'm so glad. Like, this is what I worry sometimes with all these really, really big seed rounds. Like, like money, mainly money does is it gets you, I mean, sometimes they do wheels, but usually it just like makes you get a whole lot more of what you got before.
David Senra (01:45:29):
And people need to raise early, partly because they were not tight with money. Then you get a whole lot more tight, not tight with money at larger scale, and it gets really, really bad. You're making my heart sing because I feel like I'm like on an island by myself about this because I've spent 10 years reading 410 of these biographies. All of them, controlled their costs are crazy. They'll tell you over and over again, constraints are your best friend. And then I talk to these young founders. I usually don't meet start founders because I'm not an investor, but a good friend of mine is like, hey, meet this kid, meet this young kid.
David Senra (01:46:01):
I met him. And one of the things he was talking about is like, yeah, let me show you pictures of this beautiful office we're moving into and he was showing me everything. And I was like, this is stupid. Like, you haven't done anything. You don't deserve this. And I go, go look at like what, where did Apple start? Look at Microsoft. Microsoft started in a strip mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico. And you need a triplex in Soho. Like, what are you talking about? And so the question I, what I pointed to, is like, okay, how does this make your product better for your customers? And his answer was, well, I'll be able to recruit better talent because office is nicer.
David Senra (01:46:33):
Then you don't have a mission. It can work. But I feel like you're built a $200 billion company in your wife's childhood bedroom. That's where you started. Like, maybe we should repeat that over and over again. Like, just go look at where these companies were. You mentioned the Larry Ellison episode I did earlier. Like, they're in a shitty office building. Yeah. Like, I think they had three separate rooms. Oracle, that's where Oracle started. I think, I mean, there's a well-documented effect of when companies build monuments to themselves, they usually decline right after them.
David Senra (01:47:06):
So that has a long running history in business history. I do think there's an art, like I do think that companies underinvested into office space for a very long time. And it actually was a mistake. I think space around us is actually extremely important, but it doesn't need to be expensive. That's probably an aside, but like... Oh, let's go down there. What does that mean?
David Senra (01:47:36):
It's just like, so again, we didn't have a lot of money, but we wanted nice office spaces. This was the decades where there was a lot of open concept versus own room office spaces, right? Like, was sort of a kind of fight. My co-founder is Daniel Winant. He's a polymorph. He learned programming when I asked him that I needed some help with programming and just like was good immediately, which was annoying as hell. And before he was our designer and did literally everything else to now a DJ and before that, he won poker tournaments.
David Senra (01:48:09):
So it's like it's just like it like keeps going. It's like one of these little, it's actually really, really helpful to have someone like Daniel as a childhood friend because it really, really misleads you about human capabilities. Like if this is just your buddy who does stuff like this. Anyway, he at some point, like he really, really tapped into this. No one can be more creative than the space around them. And no one can care more than the person they work for. That's the way he sort of created this philosophy around this.
David Senra (01:48:42):
I told him, look, here's max budget. And we are getting like B office space. That's kind of cool. And you need to figure out how to create spaces that are like a 10 out of 10 on doing WordPress work. But inexpensively. But you need to figure out like this cheap, right? Like, so, man, I mean, we built a bunch of offices in a row and they are insanely good at this. How many years into Shopify? This is like 2000, I think, 10 was the first one. It's six years in founding, four years after the Shopify launch.
David Senra (01:49:18):
We went out of like sort of above a coffee shop, which was like really nothing to our first office. So how do you do this? He said, first of all, the dichotomy is wrong. It's not between open office and like closed office spaces. There's like perfect midpoint because, and it has to come from your strategy of projects. Shopify loves the five person team. We increase to eight sometimes, but we think the best team size is one because like a single offer can do things that is impossible to do for teams and hit high notes that are unreachable.
David Senra (01:50:00):
But I think Planet Earth has rather played the field of what can be done as solo projects. Actually, it's changing again because of AI, which is very exciting, but like most projects worth doing need to be done in teams. Then there's a magic number at five is sort of what the military ends up like figuring out to like they test these things and come to the same conclusions. You can sort of temporarily go up, but then at some point you have to split teams and puzzle out the tasks. Each of these credit is like I think a 10x loss of productivity. So Shopify is like of our engineer like RD team is 3,500 people.
David Senra (01:50:35):
It's really lots and lots and lots of small teams. And this is also why we need this legibility coordination layer that I talked about earlier. Okay. So pods. They figured out how to make pods that are like exactly, they are private enough while being open enough. They never make the office feel dead, but they also draw you around. It's like, what's a pod? What does that mean? It's just like a room that just like sits up to, like, when you put the seventh person in, it's uncomfortable.
David Senra (01:51:09):
Like, it's like, again, think about how much policy you don't have to post. And if the environment just makes you do the obvious thing, you can play the uncomfortable too many people in this area. Like when you know what you're doing, now you don't need to post a policy about how many people you want in a pod. And people self-organize into five-people teams because that's the most comfortable thing to put in a pod. So not meeting rooms. Meeting rooms go in the middle on our limited floor space because we don't want people to spend all day in meetings and then get out of the dark rooms.
David Senra (01:51:43):
We put like everyone sits around the windows in pods and they are like structured in such a way that it all works. The coffee area is on the other side to create certain deputy. We cut through every floor eventually to create stairs that we move teams in such a way that certain teams that have to work together but work on infrastructure separated them out in floors so that they going to each other would run into other people who are using the infrastructure to, you know, and so on and so on and so on.
David Senra (01:52:16):
So design, being super conscientious about this is really important. Daniel did an amazing job. I think we open sourced the floor plans and I think lots of lots of mod like this is not interesting anymore when you look at what they look like because I think that work has gotten absorbed into the tech industry as a right midpoint. But many people cargo cult it rubber. Like they just cop Xerox copy it essentially instead of understanding so they make pods too big or whatever. You know these kind of things.
David Senra (01:52:47):
We talked about cardiovaulting a few times. You observe that behavior in other companies. I'm curious what internally you have caught your own company card holding. Oh we actually we are in a Toronto office here. The Toronto office actually has a few floors that are clearly mimicry of these ideas that Daniel figured out but are not they don't understand where the ideas come from.
David Senra (01:53:18):
Like again pots too big is like more the nice meeting room is right at the on the window has lots of light you know just like again maybe this is okay to have a few but like I went with the teams through it because we then changed some of the floor plans after they moved here and realized like holy shit this is like oh norman doors everywhere. Fuck that's the craziest thing. I'm fundamentally allergic to normal doors. What's that? Doors that you push then and then you can't tell.
David Senra (01:53:50):
Yes. Yeah. This is most like the most fundamental design error that you can possibly make is like create affordances on inner product that make people predictably do the wrong thing. Like this is such a like literally everyone who's ever involved in the process of designing a Norman door should revoke their design license. Like I'm being facetious, obviously, that isn't a thing. But like it's like it's just like, man, like, yeah, skills issues as a door is like a very common occurrence, I think, in places that are not conscientiously designed.
David Senra (01:54:28):
And like all those doors are replaced very fast. Like, I mean, the funny thing is, you can usually turn a Norman door into a non-Norman door by cutting things away and like putting a push plate somewhere, you know? So that helps. So I make a big deal out of these kind of things. Like, it's just like this needs to, like, I cannot surround people with things that are underperforming the quality that of engineering we want to do. And that's down to the detail of the doors in the office. Yes.
David Senra (01:54:58):
Wow. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. I mean, because product is not a thing. Product is an abstraction. Product is a name, like a handle that you put on some totality of a body of work. From the perspective of people creating product, product doesn't exist. It's what other people call your work. A product is just details. It's millions of little details that are appreciated if they compose right and make a bloody mess if they don't, right? So from the inside perspective, you have to sweat all the details.
David Senra (01:55:31):
The way you do anything is how you do everything. And that is absolutely down to the floor plans and the ambient noise levels and so on. Just like you're going to room is like that, like silent. It's just like you notice when you're talking while going to a meeting room, at least on the floors we fixed based on pre-specs. It's kind of uncomfortable to talk in the hallway because it's so echoey. Then you walk in a meeting room and immediately it's just a different noise level because it's just like diffuse.
David Senra (01:56:02):
We have an enormous amount of like, in fact, we actually worked with companies on Shopify to create the products of sound dampening that are now really, really like supply all companies, tech companies. It's really fun. And so in fact, like everything in our offices is from Shopify stores, right? Because again, like if anything we are doing is not mission aligned, we just didn't align to a mission. It acts axiomatically. So you can go pretty far in these kind of things. When you need something for office spaces and it's not on Shopify, we usually put a call out for someone to start that thing.
David Senra (01:56:39):
So it's on Shopify and we help them get started and build the thing. And then we can maintain our 100% Shopify quota. So it's also fun. That's incredible. We did at least one enterprise sale with a supplier because we really wanted their floorboards for something. They were really look great and were at the right price level. And like, yeah, but we can't place for order unless you come to our browser and stuff. So sometimes you have to make sure that. That's actually a good way to get a customer. Yeah, it's also a funny way of doing enterprise sales.
David Senra (01:57:10):
I want this thing, but you just need to migrate over the platform first. All of the founders and extreme winners that I have studied have this one trait in common. They have excessively high energy levels. If you're going to be the best at what you do, you need to maximize your energy and output. And that's why I've partnered with function. I signed up for function long before. They were a sponsor of this podcast. And when you sign up, they ask you what your health goals are. And my response in all capital letters was maximum energy. Function provides access to comprehensive blood tests and other lab testing to help you improve your health so you can perform at your highest level.
David Senra (01:57:44):
Function has made it easy for me to monitor and improve my internal health markers so that I feel at my absolute strongest. As a member of function, you get access to test over 100 plus biomarkers from hormones to toxins to markers for heart health, inflammation, and stress. Function gives you a straightforward analysis of all your results along with advice from expert doctors on how to improve things like your testosterone, your stress hormones, how to reduce toxins in your body, and much more. The platform is absolutely beautiful and provides an easy to understand picture of your overall health. Once you try function, you will immediately understand why it's the fastest growing health platform in the country.
David Senra (01:58:17):
You can now join function for just $365 a year. That's a dollar a day. Learn more and join by visiting functionhealth.com forward slash Senra. And use code SENRA25 for a $25 credit towards your membership. That is functionhealth.com forward slash Senra. All right, I got to talk about, I want to talk about video games. I want to talk about AI. I want to talk about them being related. I mentioned my friend Kareem a few times. I went to his house last week and I was like, dude, I'm talking to Toby. He's also obsessed.
David Senra (01:58:48):
He has an engineering mindset like you. He's obsessed with playing video games. And you've mentioned a few times where you thought you learned more about building a company from like StarCraft than almost talking to a bunch of people or reading which books. But then his whole thing was just like, he's got to feel like it's even building with AI now is even more like a video game. Completely factorio, yes. Okay, so that's the example he gave me. I haven't played the game. Can you elaborate on this? I completely agree. So again, this is like, man, the world has such a weird way of like somehow changing itself around me to make the stuff that I thought was irrelevant, relevant, or is late in life.
David Senra (01:59:29):
It's like absolutely amazing. It's just like, okay, so video games. Video games are best for, I mean, this depends very much on a video game, but in the aggregate, very often the good video games are simulations. They are word upon itself and you are an high-agency actor and you modify things. You perform actions, you make decisions, and then the game rearranges themselves, giving you a feedback loop of usually a very quick feedback loop because otherwise it's unfun. But you learn about consequences.
David Senra (02:00:00):
Of your action. So, like, competitive multiplayer games are very obvious there. And StarCraft and strategy games, they're not that popular as a category of games anymore. But, like, you know, when I was going for my teens in the 90s, like, StarCraft was the biggest game. And, you know, I loved it because it was really, really hard. It was like easy to learn how to master, which is exactly, I think, a hallmark of everything that's worth doing for motorsports, for kind of for my hobbies, tennis, all these things are like this.
David Senra (02:00:32):
But like, it specifically is like honest in a way that like there's like two people on a map mirrored. Everyone has the same potential every single game. And one person wins at the end, right? Like, it's like it's additionally, it's a game of imperfect information. It's not like chess. You don't see moves. You see only some information that you like. In fact, you have to invest. You have to use one of the things that could get you resources instead to go to the enemy base to figure out what he's building.
David Senra (02:01:04):
And then you need to interpret this. So all these kind of things is like what you learn in this game is information is everything. Like there is no right decision. There's only context in which decisions turn out to be correct. And while resource management is extremely important, you have to understand that resource management is not just quantifiables. It's not just minerals and Baspi and gas that you have to manage, which allows you to build units. It's also your attention. And frankly, attacking other people's attention is much more profitable very often in a game of StarCraft than it is to actually attack the base.
David Senra (02:01:42):
Because if you overtax their ability to pay attention to things, they will make mistakes. How do you overtax their ability to pay attention to things? You can do an early attack. You can do any number of things, especially if you play against the same person. You get a very high level. You will play the same people over and over again. They get a sense for how you play. So at that moment, there's always been the people who are just incredibly prepared. They perfected playing a single way, which my play was obviously different. Chess, StarCraft, all the same.
David Senra (02:02:13):
I disrupt other person's play. I do moves that aren't in books, right? Which are they're not in books because they're not good. But other people can't deal with it because they need the preparation. That's like their skill set is their ability to play chess is the crystallized intelligence, not the fluid intelligence to deal to roll with the punches. And so, you know, like I learned a lot about myself doing this. But I also learned about a lot about, you know, how do you, like, you know, just like how to approach a game.
David Senra (02:02:46):
Like, how do you, how do you get better? How do you, how do you get more out of every game you play? Because like I never ever in my life had as much time as some other people could to invest in something like this. So I always had to like, how can I get more skill progress units out of the time I have than other people out of less constrained candidates, right? I'm talking very fondly of StarCraft. It might just have been oddly the right teacher for me at that moment and the student was ready. And so I could have maybe learned the same lessons from any number of things.
David Senra (02:03:19):
But I think it was specifically good because of it being a simulation. You start a new game. It had skill-based matchmaking. So you should play it against other people of your skill set based on elo rating. And so you had a very, very clear sense. If you started winning more games when you lost, that means you were progressing. If you started losing more games, you were regressing on an absolute scale compared to all other players in the world. And I think that was a perfect little sandbox to explore how to, you know, think about when it's time to build infrastructure, when it's time to invest in resources, when it's time to prepare, when it's time to reveal your hand, when it's not time to reveal your hand.
David Senra (02:04:06):
And I think it was perfect place to spend time for me in my teenagers, forgiven what I did afterwards. So back to your AI question. I just find that working with AI agents, especially the, like, I mean, we are recording this. This is like week three of 2026. If we would have recorded this in week 52 of 2025, it would even be different.
David Senra (02:04:37):
I might not even make this analogy so strongly, but that's how much is happening, that the world changes every three weeks right now. We figured out some new harnesses for Agentic loops that are much more autonomous and frankly supported by models which didn't exist at the beginning of December even that can perform at this level. And so I look at my computer and I have like six different agents going, all coordinating between them. They send emails to each other, which I think is hilarious. And so, you know, just like, I'm like, man, this is starting to really look like StarCraft.
David Senra (02:05:14):
My attention is paid. Like, this one is currently working on a module for what I really, really need. So I'm zooming in, paying attention, doing a little bit of micro, giving a little bit of extra double check sort of the output of the critic, which looks at all of them all the time to figure out if they're still on task. It's the exact same thing, right? Like it's like, it is a fascinating time. It's just like, I can't describe how fast progress is right now. I just like, you know, what I tell my team is like, you know, 21 years now, starting companies is really, really, really hard.
David Senra (02:05:49):
Right? So first years, let's like just like, that's interesting. And everything's urgent because like you're getting to a margin IB got like within a week of running out of money so many times. And sometimes you build out many times it was like just like the clearance of the one-time try hurdles that shop went through was like millimeters at times. Like there's so like I bet you if we rerun the first six years simulation 10,000 times we would not succeed in most of them.
David Senra (02:06:20):
Right. So like in a way like luck is a big component timing of these kind of things people luck especially. After that, you know, IPO, you think that's probably the most interesting thing, period of the company? I think it was hard and maybe not terribly interesting, right? Like it's financing event at the end of the day. Maybe some aspects were interesting, like figuring, but like they were aspects of how we make it our own as a process. Partly this is why I did it. This is why we made changes to the process or why we wanted to have our own stamp on it because I didn't want to join someone else's process.
David Senra (02:06:55):
I wanted to have it my own. Then with COVID, which was very, very hard, definitely not interesting, actually fucking annoying mostly. And so I'm just trying to figure out 2026, man. This is going to be hard and interesting. Those are the things you're most attracted to. Hard and interesting. Year 21 is like, this is going to be the most interesting year, you know, in this company's history, probably in everyone. I think literally everyone's career. Just everything is lined up. It's like, doesn't matter what you've got.
David Senra (02:07:26):
Like, everyone's going to be measured against how well did you prepare yourself. Like, what your skill set, how quickly can you react to everything that's happening? How quickly can you readjust? How quickly can you re-arrive everything? You put out this internal memo where you're just like, I think it's, you know the language better than I do, but it's basically it's a company expectation that the first thing you, when you have a problem, you reflexively try to use AI. When did you put that out? A year ago? Yeah, no, maybe not quite, but like something along with that. And people were just like, this is ridiculous. There was like some pushback.
David Senra (02:07:57):
And now, to your point, about how fast everything is moving. Of course you would. Yeah, exactly. People will look at that memo in two years and just like he didn't say anything. It's like saying the sky is blue. Yeah, exactly. But does this excite you? What's it like? Oh, yeah. Man, I love that. This is what I'm here for. It's just like, if I wouldn't have happened, I don't think I would run a job for anymore. It's just like two. There's much better leaders if in times, like if time says stable. Yeah, but I thought you were in love with this problem. Yes. It's a solvable problem. So you'd still work on, but you wouldn't be running it?
David Senra (02:08:28):
What do you mean? I mean, I think I would be... No, I might try my hand at a different aspect of helping people self-actualize. Like, I mean, my personal mission is to cause more entrepreneurship, right? Like, that's like, I'm going to judge my own career by have I, the thing I discovered that was meaningful to me? Have I had the maximum amount of other people do this thing? When did you realize that was your mission? So I know exactly because I was like preparing for one of those internal events, summer talks, which I was like, it's always a bit of a like soul.
David Senra (02:09:01):
Like I do a lot of this like message in a bottle reading and like self-introspection. And it was like, it was 2014. I was preparing for my summer talk and I'm like, my biggest struggle was with my own identity. Like again, I think I was mentally preparing for the cosplay period, which I again wish I wouldn't. But like I was like, but I like engineering. I really, I want to spend my day hacking on stuff and building things, not managing.
David Senra (02:09:33):
And so I, again, I used my trick, partly, to give a talk on something that I was sort of come to realization, but maybe not fully internalize. Basically, I said, I loved engineering because it turns out that was the way how I, as a kid, when I started doing it, could build things. love doing is building things um and specifically i love doing uh like building things that share a thing that like i have experienced this is our moment of becoming an entrepreneur getting your first sale and so i i made a talk about combining those two things and just saying like um my mission um uh in life my my craft is actually building things in general i built i started with products like like code i then create products and now i create companies that create products um and i engineer those um and uh that caused more of this kind of thing so i i kind of wrote that as a personal mission for me and uh said like i will attempt to run shopify and try to be um the best ceo i can be until someone taps me on the shoulder and say oh people could be better for this company as long as it's in cohesion with my personal mission but i'm also like i'm perfectly fatalistic about this kind of thing i i don't i mean i don't do the job for money like like it's like i do it because i feel like i can contribute a lot i love this idea that you view entrepreneurship as a way to get self-actualized oh yeah i mean what's more honest but it's also your form of entrepreneurship i was reading i never read comments of podcasts and youtube videos i highly recommend against that but people are saying like this is like one of the good entrepreneurs this is like what you're building and the other entrepreneurs you're trying to to enable it's not like they're crony capitalistic there's like a lot of like dirty part i'm as capitalist as they come so i understood what that that comment meant uh out of every single note that i took from all the talks that i've seen you give before the one that was at the top of my list is exactly how i feel about what i'm trying to do and you said focus on craft and giving a shit and you said it doesn't matter that a bunch of this stuff isn't quantifiable that's exactly how i feel it's such a basic thing but it's like why like it's so it's it's it's it's so simple but it's just not easy right like in any which way like companies hate button quantifiables in fact it's like it's amazing to see it like man you hire the first team together and like if you um get a talk about building a company on podcast that means you were successful so uh the first team clearly did this and therefore the first team was very good and first team you hired based on your gut you you just knew you these were the people you needed um you make mistakes but you correct and that's all just sort of like judgment taste maybe even bias like i think we need to move nostalgia into the bad category of words and bias into the good category of words because bias is actually perfectly fine it's like it's like without bias you actually have no convictions like you you should try your convictions this is really what i learned for the thing so you make the first team as a pure play this is the best i know how to make decisions and then everything want everyone wants you to write it down and you know what happens when you write it down like here's the things that you are looking for here's the the thing wow the people who read it are the people who are very very good at following lists so um the people that you probably described not the people who go look for the cheat sheet the people you are trying to uh avoid hiring are the people who will study the cheat sheet very well so you just gave everyone a uh like a way of performatively doing the thing that you want to see um without being intrinsically like this right and so you end up like very quickly losing your company once you systematize things however everyone is telling you to do it every there's a giant conspiracy against um these things taste quality if it can't be put in numbers or can't be written as a list companies hate it yet almost everything you have to do to build a great company is are the things that are these things and you shouldn't write down actively avoiding to write something down is sometimes the most important uh thing thing you can possibly do do you think it's also related to the well you you brought up sunk costs a bunch of times yeah where it's like well i wrote this down i changed my mind but there's some kind of human element where it's like i don't want to contradict this because it's in writing yeah exactly again people like to be consistent over time i just don't find that important i um uh i will i found the the cheat code to always being right is just like change your opinion every time you get better information right like so because as you get closer to a point where you have to make decisions that means you will wind up with the right one as long if you do not stop at some point to incorporate new information right like and if even if you are wrong and try to figure it out you know again what do you do like you have two you have one momentarily chance um to uh steer your concern to the best possible outcome um are you gonna take it or you want to be the person who just like leans into the comfort of like somehow character consistency what like why for what like again what's what's the job you want to do is like i want to look good or be good right and so you're going to like just change um uh like it's it needs to be okay to uh change your mind when better information comes um comes along and again here's the crazy thing i think if you go through the transcript of this podcast you will find uh or just ask an ai to do it it will probably point out various contradictions inside of what i'm saying about what you do like i i'm like in this i'm probably on multiple sites the reason is actually this is almost most important thing it's everything comes in layers there's like just so many different like what's the operating the optimal operating system in some frame of reference is is often contradictory on the opposite of a larger frame of reference because um you know i just i like this box talking about boxes because like inside of a box it it is you after a while you can have a map of it you can illuminate all the corners and you understand what's there um you may decide what wasn't the right box to pursue maybe that you need to like figure out uh like maybe you need to ban it and say okay actually the problem is actually an aspect of another problem and maybe if we put a larger box we solve that then this problem isn't doesn't even need to be solved that happens but this is exactly what i mean as you zoom out you actually need to completely change the way you you problem solve because you're starting to work much more on um with much more longer timelines you need to actually make bets at a high level but you shouldn't make bets with like infrastructure because you can like in engineering again you can run benchmarks figure out if something is fast enough and it'll be a yes or no right you don't need to bet on the trajectory of uh you know databases are getting faster at a certain thing it's like you don't need to you can measure so there you want to be super quantifiable when you try to figure out which market to go into like you need to figure out well right now you have to figure out how's i going to change that market right like it's it's because you need to figure out the joint market or you is that market going to be a temporary unnecessary aspect of something else we are already doing and will it be absorbed into a different category of products um and this is still valuable for you to do and so on and you know what are humanoid robotics gonna do to the world of logistics and you know you you've got to work with trend lines mostly right which is not important in many other decision making so i think there's probably like four or five different um levels by uh by which you have to look at a problem and that is actually a lot of the skill of a good executive is to be able to meet the team where they are and like help them um talk about the outside world quote unquote like here is how their work relates to all the other frames of reference or other abstraction and how it like sits as a part in the larger company and everyone should be able to connect what their day-to-day work back to the mission like it's not like you work on customer support well you're helping people literally not giving up on being entrepreneurs right like this like it's you it's it's not even subtle it's actually easy exercise to do for for people when you ask them to do it um but it's distressing in how many companies it's actually kind of unstated um the company mission is some kind of set of uh platitudes or something um that aren't actionable those are unforced errors and i think things go better than when you when you get them right hey real quick i need a favor from you right now i'm conducting a survey to better understand the listeners of this show so the survey is entirely anonymous it's gonna ask you things like what your position is at your company what your household income is things like that this information is going to help me both keep and attract the best possible sponsors for the show which then in turn allows me to create the best possible conversations for you now i don't want to just ask for something without giving you something so as a thank you for completing the survey i'm going to host a live stream on youtube where i talk about some of the most important things i've learned from spending hours with the guests on this show and some of the best ideas that they have shared with me after our conversation so please do me a huge favor and complete the survey takes just five minutes probably less than five minutes for you but after you complete the survey i'll email you a link to the live stream a link for the survey is in the show notes of this episode and is also available on davidcenra.com i love the idea of tying everything back to the mission i do hope people go through the transcript of this conversation i think it's gonna be incredible i've printed out some of them and i'm sure people are gonna tell me about all the contradictions and i think this is the fun fun bit right like you know i i find contradictions in my belief systems all the time because we are like balls of contradictions i'll get messages i'm like i'm listening to this episode you did in 2019 and you said this and on the new one you said this i'm like i've read 250 of these things since then you're like what do you think i'm doing this to stay the same like what's the point i had high expectations of this conversation toby you exceeded
David Senra (02:20:00):
them i hope we do this at least once a year and i think the next time we do this we design with the constraints that you like and we just we just evangelize entrepreneurship and the fact that you know it's one of the most important things in the world and i think you're creating a lot more entrepreneurs and i'm trying to create a lot more entrepreneurs i just i i because um i'm not sure if i maybe i've shared this publicly but like i think you're gonna get more mileage out of this than anyone else the um when we did surveys with our customers um uh about like because we wanted to like like i mean we need to identify where are our customers what they do what do they read these kind of things what we have found this is long time ago before your podcast existed it was like almost 80 percent the high 70s of percent people uh check the box saying they have someone who if they sent a entrepreneur question to would respond to the email in 24 hours um and i initially thought that was um insanely cool how many people have such a resource like it in the general population though right eventually i um clued in i think it was probably on wikipedia i read about survivor bias um um survivorship bias and i realized fuck the reason why they are my customers is because they have someone who responds to these questions in 24 hours it's the other way around it's causal um and um the concept of entrepreneurship is so underexposed and underexplained it's sort of got better in the 10 years 15 years since these surveys but i think i love what you're doing because you're just bringing this concept like you you you're rolling this out for people to introspect like an entire life story of entrepreneurship giving people the thing that is implied by the question is like do you have any exposure to the world of entrepreneurship in some way that you actually know what you're what you're signing up for because the people who don't know it exists the people who have no relation to it or the people who don't happen to have someone in family or friends who have at some point started anything well they just won't try it's not part of their toolbox and just making putting this part into people more people's toolbox is going to be so load-bearing because i think actually in this world of ai there's going to be disruption and so many more people than people believe have a plan b with entrepreneurship and i think we can i think making things will be much simpler in the world of uh just-in-time manufacturing and 3d printing and additive and raisin printing and all these products just humanoid robotics dreadnought lights off factories making anything on demand and 3d printers in every home um or at least uh they very commonly in homes now um you know in that world um more people will realize and working with ai is about learning the skills of figuring out how to make the better cup um and how to design a better version and not having a normal door is capitalism the best parts and um uh i think it will be much more common and much more uh exciting and i just like it's so fun to work on and like in that way like you and i work on the same project which i think is super super cool right like it's like because the information gap is getting the stories out telling people that's possible and and is so important for people to then try and hopefully then we might use shopify and then hopefully we can push from behind i love that i appreciate you saying it appreciate the time thank you so much to awesome hand i hope you enjoyed this episode please remember to subscribe wherever you're listening and leave a review and make sure you listen to my other podcast founders for almost a decade i've obsessively read over 400 biographies of history's greatest entrepreneurs searching for ideas that you can use in your work most of the guests you hear on this show first found me through founders
