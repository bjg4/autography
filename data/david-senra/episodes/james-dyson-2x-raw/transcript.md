## Transcript

David Senra (00:00:01):
You have a weird combination of like, you build some of the greatest marketer technology, but you're this obsession with and a lot of like the past, which I think is very interesting. Yeah, a healthy obsession with the past, I think, is, I mean, I did last in Greek in ancient history at school, yeah. And apparently, of no use at all, but it is interesting how Greek civilization took place and how Roman civilization started and how it failed and how people governed, oligarchy is good, word, dictatorship, or democracies. It's interesting, and history repeats itself, and it's repeating itself relative too quickly at the moment. So it's history is interesting. We were talking before this recording, I have this obsession with reading everything that you have written. I read your first autography five times, your second one, at least two times. But then, you know, people might know about this, but they don't know that you actually wrote a history of great inventions. And what I noticed about this is it was published.
David Senra (00:00:32):
I think you were in this like 2001. What caused you? Like, why did you do this? You're building your company at the exact same time. Yes. Because I'm really interested in inventions, how they happened, who did them, what personalities were behind them. And they're inspiring stories. And luckily, an editor of a big newspaper in Britain asked me to do it, so I agreed to do it. And actually, published it as a series of colour supplements to a weekend newspaper and then put it into a book. How old were you when you started this when you had this obsession with history? Oh, from school. Absolutely from school. But particularly Greek and Roman history. I mean, British history is really interesting. I know all the kings and queens, I know their dates. I'm not a clever person. I'm not really remembering things, but I have remembered all that history. And it probably does repeat itself, so you can learn really interesting things in history. And this is what I noticed. People are the best in the world what they do or near the best in the world what they do.
David Senra (00:01:03):
They all have this love of learning from history. Sherlinger is also my great favorite quote. He says that learning machines are formed of leverage. And you can actually, you know, use ideas people long get, and you'll find out they were very similar to that they had the same thing. They went through the same struggles, the same, they had the same fears, they had the same insecurities. They had the same triumphs, and then you can just pick a book of somebody's life story like the ones I have in front of me. I told you before I start recording, I was going through, you know, very, I had this obsession and love with my work just to do. And in my case, it was not an invention, it was creating podcasting, podcast. And this book, I found it, you know, I think it was April 2018, the very first time. I read it, and I'd already been struggling to start a podcast for two years and very almost no success at all. Amazingly none, no success. And it's going to be fine and a half years of struggle. And the reason this is so important to find a year two into five and a half years before I had any remote level of success is because I'm like, well, James, sort of just focused 90% of this you've shown for 14 years, going 5,100 prototype team, and refusing to give up.
David Senra (00:01:39):
You're also funny as hell in the book. Where you're like, anytime if you think I'm, you know, how little you realize I'm only celebrating that I have the stubbornness of a mule. This is the note, so obviously I marked the books like crazy now showing this before I start recording. And this is really, I guess, the very last page. And when I was recording my thoughts for the benefit of other people, this is what you started to do. I hope Dyson's story inspires you to say when you get knocked down, all right then, let's give it another go. Yeah, bouncing back is really important. And if you are exploring your territory, if you're experimenting and trying to do something different, which is what you and I want to do, you're going to fail many times, and you've got to bounce back from it. And actually, if you learn that failure is so much more interesting than success, because of failure, you question it. Well, why did it get wrong? And actually, the reason it gets wrong is something very, very interesting.
David Senra (00:02:09):
Where something works, you say, great, that works, and then you stop to wonder why it works. So you've got to enjoy failure. That sounds a difficult thing to do, but you have to enjoy failure if you want to improve things, if you want to not change the world, but change things and improve things. It goes hand in hand. And it always saddens me that school doesn't really teach that. At school or university, the thing is to be brilliant and to get the answer right first time. And there are brilliant people who can do that, but for the rest of us, we're not brilliant. And to get there, we have to strive, and we have to go through failure. And we realized that you didn't get it right first time, you don't get it right second time. In my case, and I counted it, it's 5,127 times. One of the things I always want to say is that that sounds like a struggle. Okay, it was a struggle. But actually, it was a hugely enjoyable struggle. The debt was mounting, and I have three children and my wife and home and mortgage paid like everybody else.
David Senra (00:02:40):
But I had a real point in life, I had a real aim, and I had to get there. And the failures were interesting because I learned from every single one of them, almost every single one of them. Say more about the UN aim in life submission. How did you think of that then while you're going through it? Well, when I discovered that I loved engineering, because I did classics at school, like I couldn't be further away from engineering, and I went to study design and then discovered engineering. So engineering was new to me, it's like something new. And I had a sort of stupid thought when I was at college that I wanted to design products. I wanted to engineer them. I wanted to develop their technology, and I wanted to manufacture them, and I wanted to sell them. So it's a sort of megalomania thought. Why is that megalomania thought? Because I was just a competitive student in London. How could I have this slaughter being a global manufacturer? And I don't know how or why I had that thought, but there were interesting things happening at that time because Concord was happening.
David Senra (00:03:11):
Is again this brought out his mini car, which is still going today, by the way, a hugely successful state. So it was about 15 years after the Second World War. So there's deprivation during the war and immediately afterwards. But suddenly, particularly in the mid-60s, and I think particularly in London where I was, there was a feeling that, ah, we're free of the past. We can do something new and different. Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, and Batman, Philip, all these people were having really expensive and revolutionary thoughts about design, engineering, buildings, and so on. So I was very lucky to be part of that era. And I think it, you know, I caught the bug, but I had a very cheeky idea that that's what I wanted to be. So this is when you meet Fry. I'm actually not expecting to start a conversation, which didn't go about it at least perfectly. I really want to start. Which is just like, I want, if you can explain who Jeremy Fry was and the impact that he had on your life.
David Senra (00:03:43):
Well, I was at the Royal College of Art doing design, and I was taught by a very famous structure engineer who worked with Foster and Motors. And I became interested in engineering. And I designed a button to fully type structure for Ninquisario in London as a theater for an Infusari line. And I went to this engineering company, a millionaire who had founded an engineering company and asked him if he could give money to the theater. And he said, no, but I'll give you a job. I said, you're interesting to not give me a job. They started giving me jobs. And one of them was to design this high-speed landing craft, which is his invention, that I engineered it and designed this. And he then said, I was a long-haired student with long hair, flared trousers, tight shirts, loud shirts, all that sort of thing. He said, come and start the company, making it and selling it. So I sort of looked at him a bit, and I don't know how to sell things. And he said, look, you're the engineer. You chose every square inch of that product or everything.
David Senra (00:04:14):
You know it all. You're the best person to sell it. So that was an interesting sort of revelation for me because I'd always thought there were professions. And, you know, there was sales as one profession, engineering was another, and manufacturing was another, and big manager was another. And suddenly it was this entrepreneur himself saying to me, well, you're an engineer and designer, you know about the product, go and make it and go and send it. So it broke down all barriers for me. We became great friends and had lots of discussions about engineering and shared this passion for engineering and for making things. And he found somebody that also had an obsession with the past, past engineers, past designers, past inventors you could actually have a deep conversation with about how you built our products, why you made these certain decisions, and he used those to inform what you guys are doing, correct? Yeah, so he was a friend of his again, so I never met his again, it's when I heard about it from him. They used to do hill racing together, design cars that were very, very light cars that raced up hills very quickly with very little power.
David Senra (00:04:46):
So sort of very skinny engineering, minimalist engineering. And so he had quite a lot of stories from that era. He was 20 years older than me, so he had seen a bit of life during the war and had done this racing car thing and established an engineering company. So he just removed the barriers that it was okay to be an obsessive engineer. And you just do whatever it is you want to do, and then you go out and sell it. And hopefully, like the Pi Piper handin, people will follow you. So, you know, to get that advice from someone at that crucial stage in my life was, I say, mind blowing, it was, it enabled me to carry on and do things that everybody said I couldn't do. And then what do you think? Because you worked on C-strap for five years before you left. Yeah, about seven, because I actually did two years of it when I was at college. I moonlighted and designed it while I was made one while I was at college.
David Senra (00:05:17):
And then I left college and ran the business making and selling it. What were some of the most important lessons from the seven years in your C-structure? Oh, I think I learned everything from that. I learned how to manufacture, how to approach manufacturers, and go to make components, how to set up a factory, building products, how to sell it overseas, how to find agents and distributors, all that sort of thing, and learn failures and successes with that. To learn that it's all about people, not appearances or how big their company was. It's finding the right sort of person with the right sort of enthusiasm. See, the same thing about that. Probably if you're running a public company and you're choosing a distributor, let's say, Canada, it would be probably irresponsible to find an individual who's just starting up rather than choosing an established distributor. But of course, the person who's just starting out, okay, hasn't got a name yet, but he's probably incredibly enthusiastic and put everything behind it and work all hours to make it work.
David Senra (00:05:48):
So it's the person, not the business, really, that you're backing. My friend Joshua has this quick quote where you have to decide when you're working with somebody, you know, you decide the most experienced, the most educator who wants it the most, you always choose the person that wants it the most. The experience was an interesting thing. Jeremy Fry taught me this. He hated experienced people. He also hated people with beards. Oh, but that's something else. Anyway, but this is a different idea. This was a different era. Oh, I was speaking quite that's right because people just make quite expecting the six. And bears were different than the 60s. Anyway, coming back to the experience, it was an important thing. And I discovered this. If you're experienced, you know why not to do something, or how not to do something. Whereas if you're naive and you're a young engineer, you're just qualified or you're still training. You don't have that negativity towards certain things. And often it's something that hasn't worked previously that could work and is interesting to follow.
David Senra (00:06:21):
So you're very open. And I love naivety. People asking silly questions, stupid questions, because it creates a different way of doing things. And we've got to find different ways of doing things all the time. My friend Daniel, after found Spotify, we had a conversation about this where he actually thinks naive takes one of the greatest assets a young entrepreneur or inventor can have. He said, if I knew how difficult it would be to make Spotify succeed at the beginning, I would not have done that. Yeah, there's a naivety stupid idea. I don't think that. I think that naivety is interesting because you're thinking really hard. How the hell do I do this? I don't know how to solve this problem. The experienced person might think they know how to solve it, but the naive person doesn't. So they're thinking much harder and more intelligently. James Dyson is obsessed with crafting high-quality product, and he's made some of the best products in the world by running tens of thousands of experiments throughout his life. Every single experiment was aimed at making a better product for his customer.
David Senra (00:06:52):
That is exactly what the presenting sponsor of this podcast, Ramp, does. Dyson reminds me of Kareem, who's a co-founder and CTO of Ramp. I spent a lot of time talking to Kareem, and every single conversation centers around his obsession with crafting a high-quality product and using the latest technology to constantly create better experiences for his customers. This is exactly what James Dyson does. Kareem and James Dyson both believe that nothing is ever good enough and everything can be improved. Ramp has one of the most talented technical teams in finance and they use rapid, relentless iteration to make their product better every day, just like Dyson. So far this year, Ramp has shipped over 300 new features. Ramp is completely committed to using AI to make a better experience for their customers and to automate as much of your business's finances as possible. In fact, Kareem just wrote this. It is our duty to be first movers and push limits so we can make the greatest possible product experience for our customers. That sounds a lot like James Dyson to me, and it is why I made the fastest-growing and most innovative companies in the world are running their business on RAM.
David Senra (00:07:24):
Make sure you go to ramp.com so you're not going to help your business take time and money. Let AI chase your seats and close your books so you can use your time and energy building great things for your customers. Because at the end of the day, that is what this is all about. Building a product or service that makes someone else's life better. That is what I'm trying to do. That is what Dyson has dedicated his life to doing. And that is what Ramp has done too. Get started today by going to ramp.com. So Jeremy was in the business of hiring people like a young James Dyson, who's a smart, enthusiastic person that clearly wants to do this, as opposed to anybody that came from another company or like even comparative. Exactly that. You're doing this now. You still do this four years later, 50 years later. Yes, and we've taken it one stage further because we've started our own university. So we're taking 17 and 18 year olds and starting even younger. And they work in the business and they ask naive questions. You cover the university in the book. Again, one of the things I personally learned from you is like differentiation for the sake of it.
David Senra (00:07:56):
And so anything that I'm going to do, I look around, but what I hear is this Edmund Manfred founder followed. And he had to straight line. He's like, my first motto is, don't do anything somebody else can do. Can you explain exactly your entire, like, how you structured it and how you know how you designed the Dyson University? The university is very expensive. Yes. And it's getting a bad in England, yeah. And it's horrible. And you're saddled with that debt for a long time. I mean, sometimes 20 years. And in any case, a lot of the debt is not repaid. And we need to find a different way to teach people. And it's ridiculous because they're only taught for half the year. The rest of it is holidays. So you've got all the big institutions, expensive institutions, and people are doing their part-time. It's madness. And also, as I learned when I was at college working with an engineering company, because you were working with Jeremy while you were still qualified, yes, I was sort of moving lighting.
David Senra (00:08:27):
The college knew what I was doing and approved of it. But it wasn't what normal students did. So I loved that experience working with people who are having two things, not academics, people having two things and having to be in a hurry. And I really enjoyed that. And I thought, well, why can't I give that opportunity to other people? So we started our own university. And it's a difficult thing to do because the government has to approve it. And after seven years, we get to work with another university, and none of them would work with us because they didn't like the, they saw us as the big competitors. Because we pay our students. Yeah, that's a good idea. You start with, why are we saddling these young people with all the shots of debt around their necks? That's going to limit their, you know, what they can actually pursue. They're taking jobs that they're forced to take that. They don't want to take me for money as opposed to you following your just anyone called passionate is more like a session you have. So am I correct? There's no tuition? Yes, it's tuition.
David Senra (00:08:57):
We teach them two days a week, okay? And they work with us three days. But you pay them for the free pays we pay them. They pay them $45,000 a year. They have cars, they go on schedule holidays. So those are normal people, they're not students. They're in a student group, about 170 of them altogether. But they're interspersed throughout the company, and they love that. They love working with people who are earning money and having to make things work and can do engineering, coming to do marketing things, whatever it is, manufacturing. They like the reality of that. And it inspires them to learn the academic side. Because a lot of them say the academic side of engineering is difficult. It's hard. But I'm inspired to do it because I've got to practice it every day. It's supposed to be separate in a job, as opposed to going to university and just having academia for four years. With us, they're being inventors, they're developing technology, and they're learning exactly why they need to know the academic side, the theory. Explain why it's better to have a person, a person with no experience than somebody who came from an existing company.
David Senra (00:09:30):
The older you get, the more you try to apply your experience. And if you come from an existing company, we may have picked up bad habits. I'm not saying they didn't have bad habits at Idaho, but I'm saying you picked up the habits of that company, which may not be the right sort of attitude that we want. This attitude of constant change, constantly trying new things, trying to be different, a different state, because it sets us on a different path. And some people find that difficult. Some people want to have a much more conventional way to do things. And so if you're hiring 18-year-olds working in ACENTROS, you're going to 1217-year-olds as well. 1718-year-olds. What is it like? To be honest, nobody really notices any difference. Okay, that's going to be shocking for at least for people who are like, I assume, okay, they have to graduate high school America. They have to go to college, maybe many cases they have, they go to graduate school, and then they're almost 30 by the time you start. You're like, no, how can they 18 or older do you guys think about this?
David Senra (00:10:01):
Yeah, well, because they're enthusiastic. They come to us because they want to do real work. And they do real work. And just because they're not as experienced as graduates or someone in year four as opposed to year one doesn't mean to say they don't have just the same to offer or even something better because they're even more naive. So it worked really, really well. And it's interesting. I want to go back to the seven years of the C-Chark. You write about journey, you find both books. And in case you're 50 years after this book, 50 years after you each time work with him, you said you'd disappoint a lot of ideas you learned working with them and you still apply to this data based on because it's very fascinating and it's piece of hard idea. I don't have a prejudice against PDFs, by the way. I could probably retain the pipe form, but not the best. I don't know why I designed. And I don't know how, like, you know, the hippie beer, so it's fine. It'd be a break my heart to know Jerry Fry when you come along. But one thing that's fascinating is, okay, this also speaks to, I'm curious about your opinion on risk harassment.
David Senra (00:10:35):
Obviously, you have excessively high risk harsh in both stories. But you're like, I'm working for, you know, your mentor. You think it's a genius. He treats you really, really well. He gave you complete autonomy controls. I just go one business, there's a great line in the book where you're like, he introduced you to a completely different mode of supplying the way I operate. You're like, we need somebody to know about aeronautics because I go to the radars down there, like the lakes right there, like tie a piece of a piece of wood, we got a boat, and record raps, and then change it. And but you had, I think, a wife and at least one child when you left to do the borrow? Two, two, three, four, two, and you have, I think, mortgage. So you have a family, take care of you, you have a great high-paying job, right? You have you're working hand in hand with something you greatly admire that to talk to a ton in seven years, and yet you're like, I need to go out and be an entrepreneur and do my own thing. And the second thing that I didn't understand, you know, how many times I read this, why didn't you let him fund it?
David Senra (00:11:09):
That was a really stupid decision. No, I never know that because in fact, he and Alto, when I started the backup company in this, we did fund it together. Yes. So that was a good idea. Yeah, that was a really stupid decision because even somebody understood about starting businesses, how different it was. In fact, I went to borrow money off my brother-in-law and another party who didn't understand the diversity of starting businesses and their both pains and so on. Before you get there, the decision to leave. It's almost like you seek. Tell me wrong with this. I know you see different physicians. In that time, during that makes sense. In that time, it felt like you were seeking risk for taking risk. Yeah, no, I've thought a bit about that. I think it's partly because my father died when I was eight, nine. And I think that had a sort of profound effect on me, but I didn't realize at the time. Because I felt very different to other people, because I was a boarding school, and headmaster was very kind and he allowed me to stay on for 10 years without paying any fees.
David Senra (00:11:43):
So that was an extraordinary act of kindness. But everybody else had parents, two parents, that weren't single-parent families in those days. And even if the two had split up, they appeared to come together to come and see their child at school. But I had just my motherfucker to see me. My poverty was my mother coming to see me. So I felt different. And also, I think if you lost a parent at that age, life can't get much worse. So you're prepared to take risks because you've started from a horrible starting point. Risk has become a sort of thing I need to live with. I need to live on the knife edge all the time. You still feel that. I still feel that today, yes. And it doesn't make me unhappy. I don't get me wrong. I like living for the moment in danger. Because you're on something new, you're doing something different. And it's risky.
David Senra (00:12:13):
It's not that the result is not sure at all. In fact, it's very unsure, very dangerous. And I don't mind that. It doesn't keep me awake at night. So it starts when your father dies and he died really young for you. It's four years or 40 years. You were nine. It's one of the first. I got myself tearing up because that just purchased destroys me. I guess I'll talk about this now. I'm going to go back to risk and making that jump. One of the, I think, one of the most profound impacts that your second book has is you're writing this 60 years after your father dies. And you're talking about your grandson, Nick. And you realize now it's a 69-year-old man with a lifelong set of experiences, just how vulnerable you were, because he's still taking his, your grandson is still taking his stuff home to bed. And now you're left alone with and now your boy needs a fire. Yeah, he had a profound influence on me.
David Senra (00:12:45):
He had to do everything. I mean, he loved producing plays. He loved directing them. I got notes in his little Shakespeare books, crossing out lines and making notes and other things. And he did puppet shows. He played the recorder. He did talk rugged. He talked hockey. He just wanted to do everything. And I'm a bit like that. I've certainly liked that at school. Especially if they didn't build academia. And he was like that. I just started a catching video I didn't make previously. He wanted to change professions towards the end of his life. He fought in the war in Bermuda. We call it the forgotten war. Yeah. And it really was. And it's a nasty, nasty war along my way. And he came back from that in 1946. And in 1949, he contracted cancer. So he'd been away from his wife for six years, in the first six, six years of their life together.
David Senra (00:13:17):
Then he had three years, being a classics master at school. And then he got cancer. And so he was in the house hospital. He he said, so he get an opportunity to work for the BBC or something. That's what he wanted to do. And I think I just had the question was like, how the hell do you leave this fantastic position to go off on your own? And he was like, well, I had the opportunity to. Whereas your dad, unfortunately, for precision shots, Trottle never got that opportunity. No, he had his life stolen from him at the age of 40. I mean, I'm almost 80, so twice as long as he did it. Your mom passed away early. Yes, she got cancer as well. Yeah, 50. 55? Yeah, 55. Yeah. A horrible disease. Did you ever, this is something related to what I think I was going to talk to you about, but your dad passed away 40, your mom or mid-50s. You've lived much longer. And both of them, when you were younger, were you worried that you were going to die in two?
David Senra (00:13:48):
No, it never occurred to me. No, it never occurred to me. I think it made me want to get the most out of life fast, maybe impatient, to live my life. Funny, I obviously have a habit of self-sufficient reading biographies. Most people read biographies of are not like you're actually dead. And I think this ones are like, I'll try and keep going. We're gonna come to this in HQ, and I want to record more things. I want to like see the quarters or everything else. So yeah, you're already left. In addition to your failure, one of the byproducts of reading a bunch of biographies of dead people is you get to the end and it's not yet to end the boat you get at the end of the day story and it's not morbid but you have this constant reminder that our time here is limited and don't waste a single day I think about that and I have intolerant to wasting even 24 hours and it's actually like a powerful motor and the great byproduct of the fresh structures I want to go back to you you're going taking risk for the sake of the sake of risk you want to be your own man I think is why you have the book when you leave so I mentioned that when it gets a ballbarrow but can you say so that was the point that you did ask me that question why I didn't ask Jeremy Fight to help fund that thing is because I wanted to do something on my own and you felt I'd worked for somebody and I wanted to do something entirely on my own but you'd still be the entrepreneur decision but that's how I felt at the time why I take money from it because I felt I've worked with him he'd been my mentor and I wanted to just go off and do it on my own it was to prove something to myself I suppose it's a stupid decision because I was still being having other people help fund me so it was a really stupid decision and you do make stupid decisions in that and I know if I'm mistaken because when I started back and I went back to someone who you know understood entrepreneurship who had been an entrepreneur rather than people who couldn't be an entrepreneur we were talking about this earlier you know where uh there's now a new class of capital available entrepreneurs that is not institutional venture capital that's obviously still exist but you have a lot of people that have had incredible success but I've been confronted with Michael Dell and it's something that he's interested in and providing alternative funding solutions 200 years from an entrepreneur knows exactly what they're going through that is not a professional investor has nothing not trying to make more returns they have more money than I've ever spent they literally love entrepreneurs and want to help entrepreneurs think it's really important now I'm gonna go through the list of mistakes because you always say this I love it uh I have the um the first version of your second barrier free which is an eventual life I think it's changed now I think we're gonna name it like failure more interesting than success or more functionality the publishers were quite right they said they won't sell so let's focus on the failures and mistakes that you made with the ballbarrow what still like sticks out in your mind about that right at the beginning um having people fund it uh helped fund it because i didn't put up a guarantee uh my brother-in-law put up a guarantee it guarantees against your house uh the guarantee is against my house okay um fortunately i have a house by then uh my brother-in-law put up a guarantee and we borrowed money from the bank uh by the way interest rates went to 22 percent while we were doing that business and that was the killer um so uh i borrowed money again when i started the ballbara the banking payment business um so it's not boring money this is a problem it's involving people who don't understand uh startups and the pain you have to go through what did they not understand they just didn't understand the business uh what it's like um for example uh the ballbear was copied in america by an ex-employee and another company and they wanted to go after him and teach him a lesson and i said no no no no no let's do it he wants to do it let him do it and we'll come into america um and we'll sell ours against his he'll pave the way and we'll come sell our original version but they wanted vengeance so we spend a lot of money trying to sue them and it had no good effect really so that's one example the real thing i learned is that um it's much better to put your own money in i didn't have any money i borrowed it but i was it was money that had been given to me by a bank so it was my money even though i was on the line for it my wife had to sign house away on all our possessions and all that sort of thing um besides making my decisions for me i wasn't gonna worry about investors and what they might think which which when i was doing ballback because i was always doing that you know i'd have to bring them up and say do you think you should do this is it okay if i do this you seem to have an inherent virtue an inherent distaste for anybody else having any kind of control over what you're doing no not that all that's not meant okay i'm don't you raise that that's not what i meant for example i have non-executive directors who run the business as though it was a public business but it's a private business okay and i think it's very important to have good people advising me now what i meant was when i when i when i'm entirely on my own and i make a decision i make a decision without reference at certain in the early days to anybody else is it the right decision to the business and will it make a better product will it sell more or that sort of thing that's very very single-minded never worry about investors at all to worry about bank balance i didn't have to worry about investors which made me very single-minded and if there's a payday it's my favorite it's all down to me whereas if you've got other people then you know other people are making joint decisions so i really enjoyed not having anyone to turn to whereas with the ballbear business there were other directors of other investors so i had to worry about what they thought perhaps i shouldn't have but i did but but if you're on your own you make the decision for entirely the right reason what do you think that you thought was important that they did not for the best card when we started selling the ballbear the retailers first of all there weren't big um hardware chains they were individual owned hardware stores to no problem people or low history none of that which makes that a lot easier you might not think that it does make that a lot easier for manufacturing something so we had to sell through wholesalers who sold to all the individual retailers and garden centers where you go by garden stuff they were all individually owned so you had to have teams of salespeople getting around all these things trying to sell products to the host who can take one this week and do that one more than it was a completely mad system um now i'd started the business selling direct to people through little adverts in the newspaper tiny little adverts and people would send their checks and they said they boosted checks it was pre-credit cards you have a great line about this in the book you said the entrenched professional will always resist longer than the independent consumer yes exactly so um exactly that and that that was the point and the illustration of that is when i went around trying to sell to garden centers and hardware stores they were not interested they actually laughed and they said that thing with the big red ball no one will ever buy that um but they did buy it from these other labs so i wanted to go on expanding the idea of selling direct and not having a middle person and not having to have salespeople but they said no no you're being successful i think now is the time to do properly in the factory um and and sell them all the way through retailers did you push back against that decision a bit yes and i said we're doing quite well i'm no one wanted to borrow money we're not we're not dependent on anybody we're just replacing these ads and seeing what happens and okay the business might be very small but it's it's okay actually it's wiping his face but then we adopted the data and the deck got bigger and the debt went to 22 percent interest rate i mean a company's argument if it could make um you know five percent profit or ten percent net profit but we're fighting a 22 percent penalty all the time the best leaders in business are able to spot patterns but you can't spot patterns if you can't see your data in most businesses are only using 20 of data because 80 of your customer intelligence is invisible hidden in emails transcripts and conversations unless you have hubspot hubspot is where all your data comes together so you can see the patterns that matter because when you know more you grow more and that is a pattern that never fails visit hubspot.com today that is hubspot.com so there's another thing that happened where you made the mistake of assigning this is your invention this is your ballbarrier was your creation you meet some other products we can see where that now and then you file a patent it was panable and you transferred the pattern not to yourself but to the company and then when they kicked you out of the company they then took it to your company and your patent yes they felt everything but actually there's a silver lining tool of that which i offered them the vacuum cleaner yes and they didn't believe in it this is why i'm obsessed with people uh so far for every single construction show they've done what they do for excessively longer time and from 20 to 45 years and i think you just you see this overlaying stories like people in way too big a rush that you're gonna have these happy accents you just stay in the game long enough to get lucky because it's a byproduct of the stuff you're doing in the case of the you're working on the ball barrel right and you discover what a cyclone is because you're solving a problem with the ball bear you head there's no way you've ever really done the beginning and you could apply it to another main and then wipe athletic or your parents can you explain what you're doing i accidentally discovered the cyclone for the first time the important thing is to observe things all the time for an engineer and work out how they work and also um internet you're always working out how to make them work better would it be better if i did this is no better way of doing that and um and that that always happens with all inventions they don't just come out of the sky they occur because you observe something so curiosity and observation and trying to understand things is the way to come up with new ways of doing things and so it was with the vacuum channel as i said we um we had this huge plant that's uh that sprayed the the frames with powder and whatever path missed the frames because it's explaining so big of the place masses of it missing it and you cycled it we were sucking your way onto a cloth filter huge cloth filter which clogged all the time you make the connection you see you make a connection and what um clever people did um was have this huge cyclone so i got a quote for one and we could no way we could afford it so every couple of weekends we built one and it was 30 foot high and uh it we had to make a holistic roof of the factory to stuff that has gymnasium as a valid test at the top and a cyclone separates dust from air so that between you and i there's a lot of dust and a cyclone will separate that by centrifugal force uh so it's if you if you're driving to a corner of a road very fast in your porch you uh if you drive too fast you spin off into the ditch um and so that is with a dust particle uh dust parklets between us are floating they're very they're very fine if you make them go around the corner at very high speed they get flung out to the edge into the ditch so a cyclone is a circular container and you apply enormous centrifugal force to the dust part
David Senra (00:20:00):
Within it, and they all get flung to the outside wall. And the only way out is in the center, a chimney in the center. So that's the basic principle of the sidecar. So I made that, yes, I'd use backing inside everybody else, and they always need to make this screaming noise and not pick things up. One weekend I was cleaning the house and the bag was full. But no, it said the bag was clogged, which is a slightly different thing. Anyway, so I looked around for a new bag confined one in the house. So I opened it up, emptied it out, and then got to check it back up again and shoved it back in. Still no suction. So I thought that's what I thought. It didn't start because the bag was full. And I suddenly realized the bag was empty and something else was at play here. And I opened it up. I took the cattle and ended it up and there was a fine lining of fine dust around the inside of the bag. And I suddenly realized that the suction is created by airflow, which has to go through the pores of the bag.
David Senra (00:20:33):
But this fine dust is clogging the pores. It's not the fact that the bag's full. It's the fact that the bag is clogged. They call it like full indicator. That's a lie. It's a bag clogged indicator. So I'm not pretty angry about this. I did go out and went and drove to a shop and bought a new bag and put it in. And I had good suction for a short while. And then it dropped off again. And it said bag full. It wasn't back full, bags clogged. So I got pretty angry about this. But I came to a realization. It's not very clever realization. But all we had was trying to get through these little holes in the bag. And it's so easy for them to be closed. And then, of course, I remember the big cyclone used, 32 cycling, we built a factory to stop the cloth getting clogged in the dust. Instead, we were spinning it out successfully by central fuel force in never clogged. So I thought, why don't we have one of those 30-foot cyclones inside a vacuum game that a foot high? So it wasn't very clever, really.
David Senra (00:21:03):
So I built one, I was very far. Well, I'm not realizing that. It's not very clever. So I built one very quickly in the kitchen at home, how much carpenter, and I take it again. I took the bag off my upright backing chain, I replaced it with a pose and this cardboard mini version of the 341 we built to work out of steel and pushed it around and I was pushing around the first vacuum chain that never lost a structure. So I thought I had a good idea, so I felt a person. And I offered it to the ballbear company. Why should you imagine doing all these gardening products, right? I don't think you were reading anything else wasn't really gardening before this at the work. And then I think one of your main observations is like, this is not the best business because it's C-Cell. That's horrible. Caesar product is awful. So why are we exposing English? People are like, people buy our computers all the time. Every day, and that's what I want.
David Senra (00:21:34):
Because the seasonal product, you know, there's a firm day period where you sell nothing. And then spring comes along, and hopefully, you know, you start to sell. So it's, and you sell, the weather makes a huge difference to what you sell. And if you have a bad spring, it's a wet spring. You never make up for that. So if you change your products, make it better. You don't actually know one year to the next, whether it's an improvement or not, whether it's solo. It all depends on the weather. So you've got to employ people during the winter when you don't need them, then the sun, I need more people. It's just a horrible seasonal business and horrible. Anyone who runs a schema is what's over. So you take this back and forth. All right, guys, I have the solution to our problems. Yes, it's the genius invention. It's very clever, linked in this noter. I had this clever invention, and their response is, their responses, if there was a better vacuum cleaner, who would electrify some of the existing people who have done it. I'd love to start our conversation that history repeats.
David Senra (00:22:04):
The way I say it's like human nature repeats. And so added history rhymes, but human nature is very constant in this idea of, no, I can't possibly imagine a future that's different from our present. Just for some reason, the massive majority of humans just cannot do that extra step in the process. And obviously, you're gifted with that. And there's an assumption that experts do things correctly. And then machine learning from Jerry Fry is ridiculous. It's not true. It's very likely about words like Jeremy Fry ridiculed experts. Yes, yeah. Well, he wasn't that rude, but I mean, yes, he said don't trust an expert. Again, a very old idea. Andrew Carney said the same thing. And he forward said the same thing. You know where it was repeated. It's drawing COVID. We're following the science. We're listening to what the scientists say. And I said, don't listen to what scientists are. Don't do everything they say. It applied common sense.
David Senra (00:22:35):
So you get this assumption changing. This is something I don't think I understand. At least your thought process. Now you're kicked out. You lose your patent. You lose how long? It was five years. You did seven years once you start and another five years. And now you're like, okay, why was there another product you knew you wanted to invent? You knew you wanted, I think, a bad word manufacturing. I think now you love manufacturing when you came on. But you were an inventor for. Well, no, no, I was a manufacturer, a full manufacturer with the C-truck and with the ballback. At the beginning of the vacuum cleaner, you wanted to just invent license. Yes, I thought that. Yes, I thought, well, I've done all that. Why can't I just invent and design things and license them to other people? Like an author who writes a book and someone else, which is surprising to me, because you clearly liked control. You don't have to learn a bad decision. Okay. It was a bad decision.
David Senra (00:23:05):
That was a bad idea. Because you have to worry about what's going on in the other person's shy. There's like horror stories. In the books, he's like, you might want to get really enthusiastic. And you come back to what's here. He's gone. And somebody else thinks the opposite. And then it was a nightmare. And I was becoming a lawyer. Because I was doing license screeners all the time. And then worrying what happens, then they cancel it and all that sort of thing. What came to mind we mentioned earlier in the mistake you fought your ball barrel program your programmes are having way to chase this guy down in lawsuits right before um he passed away for something like spend three hours children on the house and it's me and other jewelry you're not sure and you skipped for 63 hours and one thing he's just like oh wish you have a lot of suits so like any time i got screwed over people i didn't do so much i just knew realized that you can't do a good deal with that person and just moved on he's like the lawyer's gonna suck you dry is a structure in your business like you just have to keep moving on so now you go okay i'm gonna do the vacuum cleaner uh you immediately thought of jeremy fry or you had a different way initially to just search this stuff because i'd been uh having having directors and investors who knew nothing about business i thought i'd go back to someone who i really enjoyed working with and who clearly understood about starting business it sounds enthusiastic about it i like like a five years that you should since left this employment you still have released with them oh yes yeah no it's still a trend okay and so you go talk to him and he gets it immediately yes yes it's immediately actually had two ideas but the he was he and i were both more attracted to the vacuum cleaner what was it yeah yeah the other one was that um i mean they're not having it but when you send something the dust used to go everywhere so i had a device that the collect that collected it in a bag full of or some little cyclone uh while you were sending something or drilling something i mean it exists now but uh when i started 50 years ago it was that it didn't exist but we decided that wasn't big time it was a sort of peripheral thing so we wanted to something important and then whose idea was it let's not focus on manufacturing let's try to create a working prototype and then take a licensing out was it you or jeremy i think it was both of us i mean both of us have been manufacturers uh he much more than me and uh we both said look we're really inventors let's let's um engineers let's just do that bit and if the invention is good enough surely people will license it huh and then this is where we know illusion yeah so now this is the point this is what i talked about where this book changed my life because this is the point where you have an idea you have the stubbornness of a mule um you have obsession i have a lot of these things i think you have obviously a great degree and maybe we'll see how this face out uh but now this is the coach house right and so for a matter of this also coach house actually like every years like take it out with the garage for stage it's like i'm working in the garage just then we're called coach house do you have any savings are you in debt i'm in debt um i got into debt when i was a student do you not understand how unusual that idea is i have no money i'm in debt let me do this other super risky thing that you don't even have a working prototype yet no no no it's just an idea really uh little cardboard one came in your mindset then what do you think was driving you were you angered like the desire to prove yourself to love the product what was actually happening at that point that is an unusual decision to make a decision that you repair and power now respond that's an incredible time in your life well uh i saw a problem with a product that everybody uses every day a vital product to clean their homes and i as a user i hate it because we have this bag with clothes and then you have to buy another bag and so on but more than anything it's the performance is absolutely i mean if you have a hundred watt light bulb it's supposed to be 100 watts all the time but this vacuum light bulb starts off 100 watts and ends up 20 watts pretty quickly so it's deeply unsatisfactory so i thought if i couldn't solve that problem i thought if i could solve that problem other people would buy that product it's no substance it's just an idea what was the chance that you gave yourself a success if you actually start wrong you pretty stopping code no we're getting crazy here no of course not um you don't know you can solve it yeah but you've just got to try and that's true today you know when we're insulting we don't know you didn't know that we can make a micro get 130 000 RPM existing motors didn't get 50,000 you don't know you just got to do it okay so I'm not sure what's going on here about that and then I was like you made it everything with inspiring things like no because nobody knowing that it's just the idea that it's intolerable the product I'm buying does not work I'm just gonna make a working version and everything working version of people buying at that point you're right to focus in on that moment because uh ideas are so fragile and they're easily knocked away by anybody it's for extra data it's where extra dangerous experts are dangerous and forward said in his article which is showing 1910 if ever wanted to sabotage my competitors and fill their range with experts they know so much about why something won't work they'll get no work done exactly exactly your philosophy history there's a lot of overlap history repeats itself you ask people what they want they want to fast forward you know that that repeats itself time and time again many times every day well you made the point where no instead of having their energy just like you're asking people to invent the future that's your job that's your job what are you doing yeah let's focus back on this this is a very important point that terminology that you just you mentioned so you shout out the coach house you you're getting more money so how are you funding things i know your wife is like selling art but like did you go immediately back and take out another mortgage what would you actually do exactly that uh i went to the bank to take out a mortgage and uh jeremy fry guaranteed part of it so we said we need i think over 50 000 pounds to last two years so he put up a guarantee for 25 000 and i put up a guarantee of 25 000 so that got the things started why could you do it for so cheap because you're only expensive your time yes yes i'm working at home uh the only expense is my time and a few cheap materials i couldn't buy lathe or equipment i'm doing it all with whole black and deckers and things like that uh by hand like i was making sight tags by rolling in rollers and went to bought some antique metal rollers down at a junk store for 25 pounds and i could roll side tags in a funny shape like a sort of uh upside down cone and sold them together so i'm doing everything by hand um but i could do that and it works you can do things for nothing you don't need to spend a lot of money and you thought i'll be able to figure this out two years yeah second one five five years and i'm still doing it um you're not a great financial strain at the moment actually i thought i thought i did it quickly two years i thought i did it within a year but i discovered the rules of problems and also with almost any idea you find that when you start to apply for patterns that people have tried to do it before and patented things there's very very few patterns we file you actually you had to have something else panel right yes okay because you get exactly all because we were going to try and license it yesterday so we had to have a good strong pattern i wish we had ended up having a good strong pattern because we made an interesting discovery by accident because if you're doing enough experiments um you're trying to be logical what you're doing but sometimes uh something occurs that's not logical and it works so you've just got to keep trying that cool happen to you this is why i'm such a big believer in the editonian principle design where i think in the book you say that the biggest problem you have with young people when you like working with them is teaching them one change at a time and recording happens no bigger anything just coming here something's not working with change 15 things and your point is how do you know what other 15 things you have done have changed so at this point you're doing you have thick like i know a lot about you've been studying for nine years you work you should be working with your hand entirely still working your hands uh no no no much are useless i can't do anything with them i go yeah this is like somebody that like you know lost a lot of weights with their hands i'm like i was not prepared for how like your hands are huge in your fingers they don't think it does your body no they're working on his hands in fact no no no this is richer fingerprint they're airports it doesn't work for me they're won't film there's no there's no land and it's fun actually working with your hands and your brain it's something that the schools despise for some reason this is gonna sound really weird to you maybe won't but because my entire work is all digital right i read a book i sit down i record into my microphone the digital structure computer it goes out to the world i don't you know i just see numbers go up my screen it's just i'm by myself all the time um i one thing that i do which is kind of working with my hands i've insisted on i edited all the transcripts of everything observed by hand and that is literally me going in there and changing a sentence or a word or adding punctuation if i ever do anything else or interjecting just it has to be something physical like i don't want to just have i feel i'm missing out on something and i'm trying to approximate that by like physically touching you know piece of paper this is why that's also the way they do i don't read history copies like i like i sit down with a pen uh a ruler uh you know poster notes scissors and i feel like i've just crossed crafts are here but there's just some weird uh satisfaction i get of working with my hands my hands don't look like yourself you know five decades it's something i slightly despise at school people are good with their hands who can make cars and do plumbing and so on that the entire world that we inhabit is called oh yes exactly i mean that's how man's build this and make the building that we're in yeah but we want to be intellectuals i'm not getting involved in the dirty work and it's a great shame because i think that's why we've lost as countries the ability to make things manufacturing is vanishing from manufacturing made America great and big primitive countries that's good at it great great history and I'm just regretting hey what do you think I love when you said we're never actually this but you have this great thing that growing up in Britain at the time you did you know we still remember Churchill and Warwick II and everything else and like well one thing that we learned and we're talking was like we're not we want like we can actually persevere through to unbelievably difficult times where it looks like the end of the year and not give up about an actual common status as a victory I think that's very important so you you can borrow the money you're doing one prototype a day two one or two a day yeah day after day after day and you say in the book you know I can celebrate now because my company you know is we're going to have a 300 million a year I think with the book and something like that but I'd be lying to you if I said there were days where I'd fail all they want go in the house covered in dust and dirt and essentially get into bed thinking I may just go on building prototype after prototype after prototype and never succeeding forever what was your inner monologue during that time like how are you convinced yourself not to quit well there's hope a thing called hope expectation I don't mean um I didn't mean expecting something to work I mean the excitement of getting the next day and seeing if the next experiment is better or we have a wiser test or where's it taking me so it's uh it's a journey of discovery um which is interesting i mean it doesn't sound from the outside it sounds very boring and worrying and all that sort of thing and it true it was worrying but that was getting bigger all the time um but uh i was getting a little closer a little closer and a little closer and it made it work and hadn't got gone products but i was actually enjoying the process even being covered in dust because our engineers do their own tests and build their own prototypes um because there's something funny about the process of actually making the prototype yourself that you learn and when it fails it may have been something you noticed as you were doing it together or machining apart that the that sort of um visceral experience makes you get forward whereas if you someone else builds prototype and someone else else does a test and you've got the test results you haven't you haven't got that same involvement that same utter understanding of it the understanding quoting trigger marker his whole point was that he thought the that um the spreading of
David Senra (00:30:00):
The theory of comparative advantage is actually really dangerous. Because again, you can outsource, oh, this country over here can manufacture and will do finance. He's like, but there's knowledge and trial and error. And the company in the country or the country that is doing manufacturing is actually learning at a way faster rating you do this all day long and just doing trial and error. So it's nice, like the problem with people coming with the theories is it's the first order effect is fine. You're not considering, you're just going to second, third, fourth, fifth order effects, which can happen over a long period of time. I never anybody was doing this corporation on that because I've never done that before. I'm going to just go for this. So they teach you all these things. Like, this is stupid. I think Markers actually wrote about this yet. No, no, experiencing the whole thing is absolutely critical. But you taking a data on, did you allow yourself to think how far was it literally just what's in front of you? Like, are you thinking what this is going to be a month now, two years from now, during this time? Well, I was imagining that if I can make it work, that I can then go and show it to the existing manufacturers of these flawed vacuum clearers with oral bags in them, so many noisy, dusty, expensive bags, that someone would snap it up.
David Senra (00:30:37):
That's what that's what was in my mind. And they wouldn't necessarily say it might make me rich, but it might get me out of debt. Money in finance is not a driver to you. No, not to survive and live, of course. And money can sometimes be a good determinant of whether what you've done is successful or not. Not always. Sometimes it's just not. So I don't necessarily develop products to make enormous commercial success. It's nice to do that. But sometimes you do it because you want to do it. It might be a small success. I think there's a very simple genius to your approach and can't be building anything. This is why you keep recommending your books or everything, because there is just a simple, beautiful, elegant genius to the way that you think. So this is a hairdresser's probably a good example of that. I used to be sorry. Because we're making vacuumers and cooling products and heating products and stuff.
David Senra (00:31:07):
And we've done this tiny motor. We thought we could make an even smaller one. We've done that motor. We can make an even smaller one. And that would make a great hairdresser. And so there's ultimately great notes, they have it at the moment. So that was the start of it. But every time. These are discovered by Trowner. Yes. Well, very early on in the vacuum container business, we're buying these big heavy vacant containers. And they get 30,000 RPM. And the theory is the faster you make a motor go, the smaller it can be, the fewer materials it can have, and the more electrically efficient it is. So quite early on, we realized that we needed to develop a new type of electric motors. Because electric motors, this sort of thing haven't really changed for 150 years. It's the same Faraday idea. So rather cheekyly, as people who don't make electric motors, we thought, let's make a new type of motorcycle.
David Senra (00:31:38):
So I recruited some people from British universities who are academics who have new data electric motors. And we started as a non-electric data manufacturer, developing our own motor. It took a long time, it took 10 years. 10 years we had to test material. Yeah, yeah. You can say we were being stupid and all that sort of thing, but no one had done this before. No one had done, made a motor that get 140,000 RPM. Let's jump around and go back to dentistry. It's the dentist drill, but that only lasts a few seconds. Let's jump back before the history of building company where you know. When you're thinking about the products you're making now, are you starting with because you seem to be my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, one of the best companies in the world making motors. Yes, yes. And so I feel that now you're like, what else? We have a skill set. We have the copy of 45 years old, something like that. We have this world-class skill set, are there other products that we find efficient in need of renewal that we can apply our billions and work class down at building much more true?
David Senra (00:32:12):
Is that the product? Is that a process of cryptography? It can be. Okay, I mean, the brilliant idea of doing an electric car. Because sitting in your um, we make electric motors, we make uh filtration and uh cooling devices. Let's talk about it. So we thought, oh, we should do an electric car. What was this? Uh, 2014. Okay. And so I looked at what the industries were predicting, and they said 2% electric cars by 2030. And I thought they got that wrong. They're copyright. So we started building an electric car. We're inventing batteries, by the way, new technology was still. So the battery manufacturing batteries. Oh, yeah, not yet. We want it. We want it. Yeah. We're surprised on a controller. I know I understand that. New technology was. Not all new ones. So we said with developing batteries, but electric motors are one of our things.
David Senra (00:32:43):
Air treatment is another one of our things. That's pretty much an electric car. So we started developing one. And then we got to 2017, and Diesel Gate happened. So the first three or four years, Tesla was everything. Tesla was doing everything very successfully. But no one was taking notice of that. They all thought Tesla was a fashion on the panel or something. They were ignoring it because it was such a different thing for them to do. They make internet busting engines, not electric motors and batteries. So the dieselcate changed all that. They realized, apart from a PR point of view, but also this horrific reaction to DieselKay that they had to get into electric cars. So most of the big manufacturers immediately jumped into electric cars and made them. And they make it true. But electric cars are very expensive things to make. Batteries are incredibly expensive. The electronics involved in the battery is expensive.
David Senra (00:33:14):
The batteries are very heavy. So it's a very different type of car and very expensive to make. And much more expensive than the internal business. They were selling them at a loss for a complicated reason. Car manufacturers emissions, which are controlled by law, are based on their overall emissions from their range of cars. So if they hold out the individual, I'm not the individual model. So if they had a model which didn't emit anything, they could go on making big gas gasing vehicles and watching a lot of money. So they're prepared to lose money on the electric car to make money on the big gas gas and SCV or whatever it is. So Tesla and us were just electric vehicle manufacturers. And Tesla's brilliant. And $30 billion going into a huge investment. I'm a little company on my own. And I have faced a very uncertain future trying to sell an electric car in that sort of setup.
David Senra (00:33:47):
And if you have fairly low volume, you're a new manufacturer, all your costs are 30% higher. Because you're not buying very many seats in the seat manufacturer or many tiles and target manufacturers and stuff. All your costs are much higher. I knew that because it serious structural disadvantages, disadvantages. And Tesla payments through share scale and nice and investment. But we didn't have that sort of money. We couldn't take that sort of risk. So we stopped it. And how much did you spend on RD for that? Well, we spent about 750,000. So I made a million. I was just spending 150 billion dollars. I keep working pounds, half a million, half a billion pounds. I guess it's 750 million. And you have the other actual prototype sitting in your headquarters and in Singapore. Yeah, yeah, I got one there. You can at least driver. We could drive very slowly, but health and safety meant we couldn't take out. We built one of the final sort of.
David Senra (00:34:18):
Where's that one? Is that one thing? No, no, no, that's a model that's in Singapore. No, no, no, we've got to get it one hangers on our airfield. Okay, okay. Do you agree again anymore? No, no, it's too painful. Like, do you get a car cost you sell it? Everybody says, you know, you must learn a lot from that experience. And the answer is that absolutely nothing. What do you mean? No, I mean, it was fun to do, but it was fun to do. It was fun to do. And half the people were snapped up by other manufacturers, and half the people working on it came to work on tend to back and came in. I think it's big of an emotional thing. Like you worked on something for a decade and going right now. No, it's an awful thing to do. But sadly, we didn't really learn anything from it. All the boundaries and stream winners that I have studied have this one trait income.
David Senra (00:34:48):
They have excessively high energy levels. After spending several algorithms, I think it was obvious that he has high energy too. If you're going to be the best way you do, you need to maximize your energy and output. And that's why I partnered with function. I signed up for a function long before. They were a sponsor of this podcast. And when you signed up, they asked you what your health goals are. And my response in all capital letters was maximum energy.

What is an example of you taking the existing skill set that Dyson has built up for many decades and applying it successfully to a new product that did not come from, like, that's the actual sequence of events. It's that you united by the product first, you're just like, well, we have the skill set, what can we apply to you? Did you have a hairdresser? What was an example of that? Yes, I mean, I think the rubber creature card is slightly dangerous. Okay, because we were saying that we've got the skill set and match and we say what it looks like it would go very well in a car without really saying is that going to be a successful product? It's going to be a break-three product.
David Senra (00:35:50):
Well, it might be a break-the-reach product if we've managed to do a battery. And certainly our motors have been developed to a very efficient motors. And an electric car is all about efficiency, aerodynamic efficiency, drive motion efficiency, and so that you can have better smaller batteries. Power consumption is a big thing. Six to a quarter of the power is taken up by air conditioning and heating, for example. So if you can make that more efficient, you can make a car go further. So it's all really about how far can you go on on the battery. But how do you come with me? I know you're first you could have. If you don't talk about things you haven't really said, that's a very good question. I didn't answer it properly. There's two ways. One is you realize you have technology and you can make a hairdryer. How many of these do you make now? Motors. Oh, we've made 150 million of them. A year ago now. Yeah, we make about 30 million a year. And it's very interesting. In the book, you said that companies, other companies try to get you make motors for them, and you adding refuses.
David Senra (00:36:22):
That's the correct. That's correct. And I love what you said because you want your engineers to focus exclusively on your own products. It's important to focus, as opposed to retrofitting your technology to somebody else to write in some ways shop. It's not a good commercial decision that, by the way, the one I've taken. Yeah, but you're not. Because I can have a division that dealt with other people supplying motors to other people, which I'm sure can make money. Okay, this is very interesting. I think this is missing business. I am we talked about before we start recording out this idea of anti-disciplinary. These people are so obsessed with the product, the quality of the product they're making, that's they're number one, they just want to make the best possible product. They do things that may seem rational because it would improve the quality of the product. And the point I make is just, yeah, you're one of those series people wrote about, where people like that are just successfully the best product for customers to solve an actual real need and retain control. They went in with the money anyways, but that's not the motivator.
David Senra (00:36:53):
So why explain your rationale? I think it's a regular shop. I'm creatures and you can actually articulate it. Why do you not set up this other division? And you would have to run. It would just make a bunch of money doing this thing. Why don't you do that? Because that doesn't excite me. My life is still living. I know that's not making money. It's developing intelligence and coming out with different radical products. That's what interests me. Not making money. But so, how long have you had the discipline to adhere to that? I'm just following excitement. I'm following curiosity. I'm following interest. How long have you been like that forever? I think so, yes. Yes. Yeah. I'm very, very single-minded. And not being distracted by things. And actually, it's really important that because when you start running a business or doing things, you have too much to do. There's too much to do. So you have to make all the time to make a choice. What's the most important thing to do?
David Senra (00:37:23):
What's the most important thing to do? If you get to be a big business, that's still important. Saying what about you? Well, if you get big, because the technology is saying you've got lots of people, so you can do everything. But you can't. Completely can't do everything. You can't do everything well. You probably can't do anything anyway. So the important thing is to decide what's really the most important thing and just do that. And the only thing you don't do, and there's going to be some failures because they're not doing things. But if you're doing something really, really well, then you'll be okay. How do you go about to tell you what's the most important thing? Well, that's the fun. That's fun. I mean, you decide the most important thing. And that's an important decision. And you say, well, I've got time to do the other things, I won't do it. Will one of those kill me? I don't know. Probably not. So I'll concentrate on the thing I really want to do, which I think is the right thing to do. Is single-mindedness and focused syncing too?
David Senra (00:37:54):
Or do you mean if that's the same thing? It's the same thing. And if your brain isn't very big, which mind isn't, it's a much better way to run your life is just to concentrate on one thing at a time. But you have multiple product lines. Yeah, that's stretching my brain a bit. Yeah, but yes. Yes, and I'm learning to manage that thing myself. I've got lots of wonderful people around me helping me, including my son now. I need a vacuum painter first. I need a vacuum here that sold as only production power one. Eight years, probably. And then was a washing machine a second? The washing machine came on quite early after about four or five years. It didn't work. It didn't work very well. I don't say that. No, and I made another mistake with that. Which was that, you know, I've been making back containers at about $300, $200, $300. The washing machine was $1,200, $1,300.
David Senra (00:38:25):
So it's more expensive than other people's washing machines. Yeah, the vacuum thing was more just about the ranking stuff. I wasn't learning from history. And my marketing people said, if you make it cheaper, you'll sell a lot more. All right, so for the last time in my life, I listened to them. We just lost more money. And the other directors, non-executive directors, said you've got to stop that because you're losing money at it. Actually, if I'd been on my AI, I'd probably go on with it and put the price up. But sometimes you have to listen to other people, and they were probably right. So we're probably behind us and come on with what we were doing. They're still in operation though. I use something in there. You have your own ideas. Yeah, it's great.
David Senra (00:38:55):
It's great. And I'll copy a lot of the ideas at the big door. You know, if you're trying to put a do that in it's time to hold it. So and it was very expensive to make, actually. And I shouldn't learn a lesson from that because it had two drums, had two motors and gearbox. It had a lot of things other washing machines don't have. But it did a very good job. It was a very good washing machine. It begs the question. Are there any other Dyson products that you own that are not available to consumers? Well, it's a big major stuff about those. Tell me afterwards. I'll hear about this. I want to go back to this because I do think it's one of the most important things. The way I describe this is this crazy experience I've been on, which I'm probably actually when I'm done bringing more biology on graphographies of entrepreneurs and founders and inventors than anywhere else in the world. And you're obviously like a top 10 list or can you condense down what you've learned so far? And so, well, if I can get it down to one word of how different these people are to most people, like most people in mass humanity, it's focused.
David Senra (00:39:29):
They're unbelievable. It's one word. They're unbelievably focused. I still, if you don't mind just asking me a question, just to see if you're making more stabilizers. This is something like I'm obsessed with as well. How do you figure out the focus on for you? That's a very good question. I think it's something which you believe could work, and that's a breakthrough. It's something completely different. It's going to do a job much better. And that's what you think. But of course, you've been following. There's intuition. It's just I can't get this off my mind. Like, what is actually happening? It's part of the intuition. But I don't believe in intuition is feeling for guesswork. Oh, I think you know. Intuition is much more interesting because it's all sorts of influences. It could be a good history. It could be all sorts of things. But a form of opinion that.
David Senra (00:40:00):
You define as intuition, but actually it's not. It's a whole lot of hundreds, thousands of things you've experienced, which help you make a decision, or give you an insight, or give you hope. What do you think is guiding you to the right to focus on rethinking? That's the whole thing. And ultimately, it's intuition. But intuition isn't just, it's not very fair. It's not a feeling. Your brain has been fed with hundreds of different things. And from that, you make a decision. And you can't rationalize it and say, oh, does that that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, therefore, this equals that. It's an intuition that um, I could be right, I could be wrong, but I think I get back that I'm right about this. And then you've got to make it work. Yeah. But it's very fragile. The early idea. I came back to that, but the vacuum chain, um, the cyclone idea.
David Senra (00:40:31):
It's a very fragile idea. You can blow it away. It's worth nothing. And they try to be a progressive. Oh, okay. Everybody tried to do it. My friends write to those ways. Do you have to do your way? Yes. And because your company is deepened as you get down the path, are you pretty aggressive? No, I'm not going to give up to ourselves problem. I'd guess that. I got the bargain. I'm not. I'm going. I'm going to go on. I'm going to make it work. And, you know, it's been five thousand million much longer than I thought it would. I think I got deeper deeper into debt. But I was going to make it work. I'm going to rat bartel. I'm not going to let it go. I've got to make it work. I've got to. And the more the bigger the debt got, I suppose the pressure became greater and greater. The pressure did, but did you have a lot? You had loss and confidence and like doubt about that period. Well, of course I had doubts. And that made it work. Yeah. A couple of tendencies you don't have doubts.
David Senra (00:41:02):
Would you talk to anybody about this? Did you? My wife. Nobody else. No, Daggery. No. No, no, actually, I bought him out. That's what I got to do. Okay, so you don't know why you bought him out. And this is this is after failing for it if I remember correctly, after failing to try licensing it. Yes. The first successful Japan, right? No. You made like 70,000 a year. Yes. You're making sure they used it. Because it was like pink, right? No, they did use it. I thought he said in the book, they're like, they may have just been in front of art. Maybe they didn't sell anything. They did sell some. And I never discovered how many they sell because they're very secretive about it. But they did pay me the minimum royalties. And that's when you got Jamie O'Connor? Yes. We had a big lawsuit. And is it the same way? Yes. Oh, God. And he hated lawsuits. So when that started, he wanted to get out. So I was that contention you did.
David Senra (00:41:32):
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I remained very good friends afterwards. He just said, I hate lawsuits, and my financial advisor thinks the vacuum team is going nowhere. And he had 49% of the business. So he signed off. I bought him out. How much money though? 45,000 pounds. This is another thing we haven't. So I've remained friendly with this children, but they'll never forget. I think people know this, you know, hopefully that introduction wherever thesis, but you own 100% of data. Yes. It's one of the most valuable private health companies in the world. Well, I think it's that, but I've heard stories. That's fine. I'm not that bad. And you have you bought out 49, 540,000 pounds. Okay, so what happens? Now you're on your own. Yeah, completely on my head. And you stay in the background. Yes, for five years.
David Senra (00:42:03):
Yes. Borrowing money, selling actions in the lawsuit, lawyers on contingency, all that kind of thing. It took five years of my life. The only income was the drip of license agreements. Yes, but a drip of license screens. At one point, you said, hell with it. I'm doing this on my own. I meant not licensing. I'm going to manufacture control it from suits and us. Yes, it was at the end of the lawsuit, actually. That's when I decided I'd have enough of this licensing game. I'm going to do it myself. But you have no money, no money. And I'm sick of traveling because I'm trying to depart in America all the time. I was just sick of it. I got meditators from it, I think, from an airplane. So I thought that I'm going to stop. I'm going to have a little cottage industry making vacuum changes in Britain. That was the okay. But then you had to borrow, I think it was like 600,000 pounds about tooling for the tooling. And you did that how? Well, I went to various venture capitalists, the whole people who ought to lend to startups.
David Senra (00:42:35):
And the kind of response I got was: well, you know, somebody's interesting area. We've been investing in restaurants, class food restaurants at the moment. Or we're not lending to you because you're an engineer. If you bring someone from the industry to run it, then we might consider backing. Those are the sort of responses I was getting from venture capitalists as we used to call them. And so in the end, I went to my local bank, the Teering Bank. And you're putting out a collateral my house. Again. Yes. Okay. I'm getting quite used to this. David has to keep signing the awful grave forms of signing away the house. So yeah, I borrowed it. And they lent me a huge amount of money, actually. I mean, it was 1992. There was a big housing crisis. The banks had lots of properties properties. Wait, there was a guy. Didn't somebody inside the bank voucher you? The Lego Bank ran a system.
David Senra (00:43:05):
Instead of going to a man sitting in a branch of the bank and borrowing from them, they had a sort of flying doctor who went around businesses. So he was a real business expert, and he didn't work for an office. He just went around people's businesses. Very interesting now, actually. And the bank refused his request for the loan. So he went to the ombudsman within the bank and persuaded them to lend him the money. And it was a crazy thing for them to do, actually. Because, you know, this guy setting up business maker vacuum changes to compete with all the big multinationals on Percy doing, living in a little kitchen house in near Bath. When you think about it, it's completely mad, yes. And when we were making a profit and everything was okay, I said to him, why did you lend it to us? Why did you get to go through hoops to lend me that money, which was so sort of a risky thing to do? At a time of deep recession, when they possessed, had to repossess so many houses.
David Senra (00:43:36):
He said, oh, well, I went home to my mother, my wife, and said, What do you think of a vacuum game without a bag? And she said, brilliant. Exactly what I want. And he said, I also saw that you had fought a five-year lawsuit in America. And I saw that you had determination. So I was very lucky. That was a real piece of luck. Do you think that is the key to succeed? Is determination more important than we're not going to focus, but termination is much more important than intelligence. Yes, yes. Dogginess. Never giving up. Just carrying on and not worrying what other people are saying. You know, my friends said you're completely mad when you're extending your work every day in that shed with all that dust around. So most of people around you were trying to dissuade you from doing this. Yes. Everybody thought I was mad. How did you receive that feedback or that criticism? The more I got it, the more encouraged I became actually. When I was trying to license it, I went to all the people who are now my competitors and a lot of others as well.
David Senra (00:44:11):
And they all turned it down. They weren't quite interested in it, but turned it down. And the more it was turned out, the more I realized I had something. You believed you're right. Yeah, no doubt. Yeah. Because they never really gave a good reason. Well, for the vacuum, the existing manufacturers, there's a great strong book. You know, again, I'm a coaching market from my heroes, like never ever think about anything when you should be thinking about carpenters. He's like, instead of this rule, humanity, they should try so much different behavior. And I'm thinking of Charlie when I'm reading your book. It's like, yeah, you know, it turned out it's really hard to sell. And I know you like the word bag exactly, it should be like, no loss of subjects. I should back the figure. I should use the term for the story. It's very solvable. Do people make 500 million dollars a year vacuum bags? Well, it was partly that. It was partly that. And partly I realized they didn't want to change. Human history. And that's what encouraged me.
David Senra (00:44:42):
And although each rejection, I should have got more to press. I actually had the opposite reaction. These guys don't want to change. I think it's going to be one of the most wording things I learned from this conversation. Assuming that you're doing things for the reason, you're from curiosity. That's what you're doing. This idea of taking, essentially, with a negative and turning it into a tool. You're turning it to a field. You're trying to dissuade me, and it's only making me more dogged. I think you're cut out your doggy termination is great. Well, no, they're rejecting it without having a good reason. Yeah, that's what was interesting. Yeah. And you would have listened if they found a design for it. They told you exactly. Something there. No, I am right where it was wrong. Difference for the sake of it. That is how you build it and thinking about the best production category. You seem to be able to build the best part of everything where you create, but that's also how you create value. A lot like indurable values. So you're actually doing something differently and better than anybody else.
David Senra (00:45:12):
But that's what I'm trying to do. A different and an advanced takeover. Which I don't know if you remember, but you'd be different, even if it was worse. I don't know if you still leave that now. Oh, yes, yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, because sometimes, for example, with the vacuum chain, typically those out of a bit. Someone would say, some people say it's worse than disposing of the bag. Because it creates a bit of dust, yeah. So the wrong, I mean, not everything is always perfect about something which makes progress. And eventually you overcome the problem, but so not everything is better. Sometimes it's not everything is better. But the good overcomes the bad. It's much better than the bad. But the difference is you're essentially organizing design protocols. It has to be different. You're not going to make. There's no reason why it's going to be better. So I don't have to go back. In my opinion, yes, yeah.
David Senra (00:45:44):
But it has to be, you're not going to make like another media product. No. No, no, no, because I don't want to do that. I'm not motivated to do that. And I built a team around me who are motivated to take risks and do something different and better. Always. So let's go back to you buy the tooling. I'm not going to read the entire book. You have to remove the tooling and you're having issues. But then eventually, you have this great line in the book. You end one of this chapter. These are like my favorite favorite progress in her book. And it's on total control. And you say from the first routing of the idea, the research and development, testing, and prototype, mile-making, and engineering, drawings, tooling, production, sales, and working all the way into the homes of the nation is mostly likely to succeed if the original visionary and even frenzies are mule because you're only celebrating your stubbornness and sees it right through. As I often have said, I aim not to be clever, but to be dogged.
David Senra (00:46:14):
And my dogginess had gotten me so far to a point where I had my very own cyclonic vacuum cleaner at last on May 2nd, 1992, I find myself looking at the first fully operational, visually perfect Jicent dual cyclone. I was 31 years old when I tore the bag off my Hoover and stuff a serial packet in the hole. May 2nd, 1992, which was my 45th birthday. Still heavily in debt. You remember that debt? Oh, yeah, no, I do. Yes, I do. I'm a constant birthday. But yeah, so that was really important. Because to get to that point, it's taking me 11 years, I think. 11 years, something like that. And a lot of money. And I was huge in debt. But I had the first prototype that worked. Outside of your family, is that period the period you most proud?
David Senra (00:46:46):
No, no, I don't. No, it's all a... It carries on, doesn't stop. So I don't ever sort of stop and think. Now there's a moment to be proud. In fact, I don't really like pride. Why? It's sort of self-serving. It's never good enough. So you can't be proud. Explain more. Well, I'm never satisfied. I mean, there's always something wrong. I got to go on improving it. You talk about this in this book. The engineering mindset, if you're reading this idea and say, like, you're in the sky's mindset, you know, like, it never turns off. You're never satisfied. You can't just go home and look all the way things. This is great. You just see the imperfections. I don't know. Is it really focusing on the project or just focusing on the missing improvement? It's just knowing that things could be better. But there's a better way of doing it, but I haven't done it well enough that I've got to make it better. I'm just driven like that. So I'm never satisfied.
David Senra (00:47:16):
And I think satisfaction is pretty dangerous thing anyway. Well, because there's a kind of smugness to it. But I'm perfect, so I think I need to make better than this. I can relax. And I just don't think like that. I'm always wanting to do something better. And my wife hates it because when we're exploring the car or something, I always think there's something better around the corner. And she wants to stop and enjoy where we are at the moment. So, but I do accommodation on that. But I mean, that's how I think and feel. But does that lead to, but you shouldn't be really happy and like not content, right? You're using a really happy person. Where this is not like a torturous inner monologue, where all you see is that you're never satisfied and you see the things that we face. It is slightly torturous. So it's what I do. So they'll say, if you also need you to, you know, periods of like very dark, like unhappiness, how do you how do you not let it well I suppose I'm lucky because I don't think it makes me that's unhappy.
David Senra (00:47:50):
I mean I have moments of unhappiness, but but uh give me a whole moment of unhappiness. Well, you know, a lawsuit case is wrong or something or something or an experiment doesn't work and I hope you would listen to things, but but I bounced back from them very quickly. They're just minor. Is that more like you got better with the wisdom of aging experience? No, I've always been like that. So you guys have been the same person and yes, never stop. Yes, yeah. Yeah, so I'd say that's true. And I think my father's death has quite a lot to do with that, coming back to that. And I was in a sort of a group, because we lived in a school in a public school, in a private school, sort of a better expression. And the other teacher's children was the same sort of age. So we were a group, and we had the run of the school grounds during holidays. But I was the youngest, so the others were up to five years older than me. So I was always dealing with people who are bigger and stronger than me, or cleverer than me.
David Senra (00:48:22):
And so I think it made me always strive. So I think the combination of being the youngest, as I'm the youngest of three children anyway, and younger than this group that I've been around with, made me try to punch about my weight a bit, and made me very determined. Because in order to succeed in anything, I had to be really, really good in order to be at tennis or whatever it was, or in a race. I had to be punching about my way. So I think I think that I'm losing my father. So losing, realizing I was on my own. And I was away at boarding school on my own. So that whole combination made me the sort of parent I am. Made me never satisfied, always wanting to find something better. And bouncing back from failures. That's a perfect spot. And this conversation James, they say never need your heroes, their hearts are wrong.
David Senra (00:48:52):
I don't feel ashamed at all. You're one of heroes. This conversation is excellent. All the people that I've studied and met, you're definitely the person I try to like the most. I really appreciate the time. Well, thank you, Doug. It's great to hear your story as well. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed this episode. So please remember to subscribe wherever you're listening and leave a review and make sure you listen to my other packets founders for almost a decade. I've obsessively read over 400 biographies of history structures, searching for ideas that you can use in your work. Most of the guests you hear on this show first found me through founders.
