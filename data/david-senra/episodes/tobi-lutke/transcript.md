# My Conversation With Tobi Lütke, Co-founder & CEO of Shopify | David Senra

## Transcript

David Senra (00:00:02):
One of the things I admire most about you is like you've been running your company for 21 years, something like that. I love people that do things for a long time, people that chase excellence, that try to be great. My entire life is founders, right? So during the day, I read biographies of History Screen's founders. I've read like 410 of them. And then at night, I hang out with founders. I don't think I have a single friend that's not an entrepreneur. And then I'm always asking the founders I most admire who are the founders they most admire. And your goddamn name comes up over and over and over again. And what they talk about is that you have very unique ideas on company building and management.
David Senra (00:00:37):
And they use the word singular a lot. So I want to kind of like lay out how you think about building companies, building products, building technology, and then spreading the gospel of entrepreneurship. I want to start with one thing that you said. You said companies are technologies themselves. What do you mean by that? In a lot of ways, take the social angle. Companies are social technology in the sense that they allow us to go all in. The only time you're really allowed to spend eight, I'm going to say eight because that's the right number to say, really, like fucking 14 hours a day, right?
David Senra (00:01:14):
Just singly pursuing a thing is like, I mean, we want kids to spend this time in school, and that's okay. And then university, you know, dedicate yourself. Other than that, like, you can't just not have a job, but just be like really into things. It's socially not acceptable. So company building turns out to be a perfect excuse. Once you call it a company, it's not like tinkering around anymore with your ideas. And you get to explore things. What a company fundamentally allows you to do is just run the counterfactual to the world you see around you, right?
David Senra (00:01:47):
Like you get to try to build the thing that you think ought to be there. And then you means test it against the market. And if the market agrees with you that this thing needs to exist, it moves energy in the form of money back to you so you can do more of the thing that you were pursuing all along. And not only that, it's like self-financing. Like if you find out, like again, I started a company which I didn't think was going to be like have its very, very big market. And along the way, it just like the market told, like, pulled Shopify out of the project I started, essentially.
David Senra (00:02:22):
You know, that's an incredible intelligence to tap into. So you put all these things together and you say, like, well, look, companies, the concept of companies, not that old. It's like we are on a 500-year run and sort of kind of extracted from things called companies, which weren't, which were actually more like quasi-governments, like the East India Company. And so the modern company is not that old. I find that if you take that mindset, that like companies are just sort of a path-dependent solution to social and somewhat legal problems, they allow thousands of people to join your project.
David Senra (00:02:59):
And it's called a job, and therefore everyone accepts this. And obviously, you can make money, so it's a good deal. And then you can figure out if this counterfactual of yours might be correct or needs updating along the way or any of these kinds of things. And you could, at the end of the day, if you are lucky, you work with other people who are really all in and like inspiring and taking it further than you ever think. And just like the wall thing is just like, I just like, I marvel at the institution of the company in a way.
David Senra (00:03:30):
Like, because if it wouldn't exist for some reason, and someone would propose the whole idea now, it would sound insane. Like, from first principles, none of this makes sense, really. Well, I heard you say something that was fascinating. It really piqued my interest when you're like, we do not know how to build companies yet. All companies are terrible, including mine, which you said, and that's hilarious when somebody's you're running a 200 billion plus dollar company, and you think that in the next 20 years, we're going to look back at what we were doing at this point and be embarrassed by what we were doing.
David Senra (00:04:03):
Why do you think that? Because it's like everything else. I'm sure when you listen to your first podcast, you're like, oh, please do it. Please don't. But honestly, this should be seen as the most joyous of moments. You should actually do it if you haven't done it. No, I do it all the time. Okay, good. Because the difference between that and what you would do today is you progress. And as a computer programmer, I experienced this all the time. I looked at old code and I was like, what the hell? Like, this is terrible. Why would I ever do this? It's way too abstract and complex.
David Senra (00:04:35):
And I made it better because I now have the skills to do so. And one of the saddest days of my life was when I opened old code and I was like really impressed with how good it was. It's really the saddest day of my life because I'm like, holy shit, the implication of this just hit me like a train, right? Yeah, you weren't progressing anymore. Exactly, it figures because I wasn't programming all day. I was like, trying to build a company instead, which honestly is very, very similar. This is one of the things Daniel Eck told me about you. Yeah. Here's what I observed.
David Senra (00:05:06):
Like you, I read a lot of books. I try to figure out, like, you know, I think someone, like, if you don't read books, you live a lifetime. If you read books, you live a thousand, right? So it's. I'm going to interrupt you real quick because I took notes on this podcast six years ago. This is the first time I came across you. And you said, books are the closest thing you'll ever come to finding cheat codes for real life. You can access the entire learnings of someone else's career in a few hours. It tracks, doesn't it? Yeah. I dedicate my life to this.
David Senra (00:05:37):
Of course, I'm going to agree. Absolutely. I mean, you know, Pretty supposed to agree with me, but I really think we need to shout this more from the rooftops. The one weird trick seems to be just read books. And it kind of doesn't matter. Just make a habit of reading books and ideally change JIRA every three books or so, at least for one book. And then that alone will give you a range that you can draw on for basically everything you'll ever do. So like, look, I read lots of books, lots of them, you know, just like, you know, especially when I went from programmer to a business, like realizing I have to just learn business really quick.
David Senra (00:06:20):
I got really dismayed with quality of business books pretty quickly because frankly, I think the business books are largely written by the people who have time, well, not the people who actually built companies, frankly. So you read between the lines as well. Depends on, like, if a person who started a company or a person writing book is a salesperson, every problem can be solved with sales. If a person is a marketer, clearly every problem can be solved with marketer. And I mean, at least that I can take away as a trap to not fall into, right?
David Senra (00:06:52):
So I was determined to not be the engineering type founder who is going to see everything as an engineering problem. Because that would be called blindness. And that's what kept my capabilities. So I really tried everything, including just how to build the team in such a way that I delegate everything and I have my different business lines and arrange things. This is sort of after the IPO. And I realized I have to be a very serious public company CEO.
David Senra (00:07:24):
And so it almost killed the company, honestly. How did it almost kill the company? It was actually COVID that saved it at this point. I had the inclinations that something was really, really going poorly. It was a time you didn't have a lot of competition, which is also really, really hard for businesses. It's not a good thing at all because, again, you don't get, you don't have a good rivalry, and you can't sort of, like, even if something seems really good, you don't know because there's no one else to keep you honest about it.
David Senra (00:07:54):
You have a distinction between a competitor and a rival. You think competition is one thing. Rivalry is really good. I mean, it's the same, but it depends. It's a mindset change. I think if you, again, if you compete with another company, like there's a lot of, we need also a version of what they have, copying, like you do the Xerox strategy very quickly. Companies tend to get obsessed. Like there's companies which have very, very, like, the most active channel in their Slack is there is a competitive analysis channel where people just bring everything everyone else is doing.
David Senra (00:08:27):
And I think that while that has some merit, I think the problem is it makes companies very reactionary, right? Like in the arts, part of everyone's art studies is fine arts. You copy the great pieces, like you make copies of great books. Your next painting is not at the quality of a van Gov. You just copy it. So mimicry is actually not an excellent way of getting to excellence.
David Senra (00:09:02):
And companies end up falling very much into this. Whereas if you treat someone like other companies in your space as rivals, much easier to have a positive outcome there because rivalries inspire you to be best. Like Agassi could not have been Agassiz without Sampress being there, right? Like, and he very, very clearly states this in his book. The Sampress that existed during the Agassiz area that Agassi understood wasn't a real person. When you read Sampress's biography, he just liked tennis.
David Senra (00:09:34):
Yeah, and Augusti hated it. I guess he hated it. And so the rivalry he created for himself created him in a very real way. In the last dance, which I loved, Michael Jordan, he admits that he might made up a slide at some point, which to me is one of the most profound moments. Sometimes I play the last dance in the background while at work. It's my favorite documentary, my second favorite one. So much sense. The defiant ones about the partnership between Dr.
