The author reflects on a decade-long personal health tracking study and identifies three 2026 developments converging to create continuous care infrastructure:

## I. Clinical Action Through AI

Utah launched a pilot with Doctronic enabling AI to handle prescription renewals for chronic conditions across 190 common medications. The system includes physician escalation protocols and malpractice coverage. Doctronic's research indicates "81% agreement on top diagnosis and 99.2% alignment on treatment plans" between their autonomous AI system and board-certified clinicians in telehealth scenarios, suggesting protocol-heavy clinical work can become scalable.

## II. Advanced Sensing

SleepFM, a multimodal sleep foundation model published in *Nature Medicine*, was trained on over 585,000 hours of polysomnography data. The model reportedly predicts 130 conditions from a single night's sleep, including mortality (0.84 C-index) and dementia (0.85 C-index), extracting latent clinical signals from brain activity, respiration, and cardiac rhythm.

## III. Unified Interface

ChatGPT Health provides a dedicated space connecting medical records and wellness apps with protective separations and no model training on Health conversations. OpenAI reports significant daily usage for health questions and insurance navigation, supported by HealthBench, a physician-informed evaluation framework.

## Core Argument

These three layers—constrained execution, rich sensing, and coherent interface—form a feedback loop enabling earlier intervention and reducing preventable crises without requiring continuous human labor, while maintaining privacy and governance safeguards.
