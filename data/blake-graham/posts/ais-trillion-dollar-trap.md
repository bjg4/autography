ChatGPT reached one billion users in three years. The internet took thirty-six.

And now nobody can stop investing.

Meta is spending $600 billion through 2028. OpenAI and Oracle announced $500 billion for Project Stargate. Amazon is investing over $25 billion per quarter. More than a trillion dollars in motion.

The forcing function is complete. With a billion users watching, being left behind means obsolescence. So every company must invest—regardless of whether the math works.

## A trillion dollars for 2% growth

Daron Acemoglu at MIT estimates AI will add 0.66% to total factor productivity over ten years. Penn Wharton Budget Model projects 1.5% GDP increase by 2035.

A trillion dollars for 2% growth represents an enormous capital misallocation—dramatically worse than the dot-com bubble.

But if AGI arrives—artificial general intelligence, post-scarcity abundance—then a trillion is negligent. Too small, not too large.

The investment scale itself reveals the implicit bet. These aren't productivity improvement budgets. They're transformation budgets.

## The circular escape hatch

Money circulates between Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, and Microsoft. Nvidia invests in OpenAI. OpenAI buys Nvidia chips. Microsoft funds OpenAI. Oracle hosts the infrastructure.

It's not irrational. It's Big Tech using each other's balance sheets to buy runway while unit economics remain broken.

"OpenAI during the first half of 2025 collected $4.3 billion in revenue while still posting a net loss of $13.5 billion during that six month period." OpenAI, Anthropic, and every frontier model lab lose money on queries. The only entities profiting are the infrastructure layer.

Training a frontier model costs $100 million to $1 billion. Post-training adds tens of millions more. Grid constraints require $720 billion in power upgrades.

Every major technology had revenue models before infrastructure. ISPs charged for internet access from day one. Utilities charged when wires reached homes. Telecoms charged monthly plans before building 3G networks.

AI gave away service to a billion users. Then started building trillion-dollar infrastructure.

## The prisoner's dilemma at scale

The trap has three outcomes. If one company invests $600 billion and competitors don't, the investor gains five years of capability lead—potentially insurmountable. If all companies invest and AGI doesn't materialize, they all lose billions but maintain relative position. If a company sits out while others invest, it faces certain obsolescence.

The paradox: no one knows if AI capability translates to profit. But no company can risk finding out their competitors were right and they were wrong.

The game theory forces a single conclusion: everyone must invest.

Once hundreds of billions are committed, only abundance justifies the spend. There's no middle ground where this "works well enough."

Either AGI arrives and every dollar was mandatory. Or 2% GDP growth makes this the biggest capital allocation failure in economic history.

Public language talks about incremental improvements. Investments reveal bets on abundance.

Someone is very wrong. Either Acemoglu and the consensus economists. Or Zuckerberg, Altman, and Ellison.

We're witnessing a 3-year adoption curve colliding with a $1 trillion infrastructure buildout to produce an outcome ranging from transformative abundance to economic disruption.

And the forcing function guarantees nobody can walk away.

That's the bet hiding in plain sight. Not whether AI works. Whether it transforms everything—or becomes the most expensive mistake in corporate history.
