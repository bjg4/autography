## Why Read

Stop debating whether you are doing product roadmaps "right", or whether roadmaps are evil. Look instead at the job you are hiring your roadmap to achieve. And then ask if the roadmap is the best tool for the job.

## A Litany Of Roadmap Ills

Roadmaps are frequently abused. To save you thirty minutes, I've organized these observed problems into the list below.

Some of these problems are inherent to the process — you need to actively work to prevent them from happening. Others are caused by user error or deep organizational dysfunction. And some are governed by even broader effects like the planning fallacy, confirmation bias, and groupthink.

**Roadmaps encourage people to…**

- Horse trade initiatives, placate stakeholders vs. focusing on value creation
- Stick to the plan when the plan is no longer optimal
- Chase harmfully high utilization rates (the jigsaw illusion)
- Future sell, instead of relying on the current merits of product
- Prioritize new feature development over equally promising enhancements to the existing product
- Converge prematurely on solutions
- Rely on estimates, despite the fallibility of those estimates

**Roadmaps…**

- Encourage the illusion that efforts are linked to a timeline (when most aren't)
- Obscure underlying assumptions, rationale, and vision
- Institutionalize "big batch" yearly planning, which decreases agility
- Encourage group think — satisficing — over focus
- Fail to address the needs of all "users"
- Discourage experimentation and acting on new insights/data
- Create dependencies across the organization

## Challengers vs. Defenders

**Challenger**: [Methodology] is flawed

**Defender**: You're just not doing it right. The real value is in [Some Positive Aspect]. Yes, some people abuse these things. Just not me…

**Challenger**: What could you do such that [Some positive aspect] would be possible without the abuse?

**Defender**: This is heresy. Here in the real world we need [Methodology] because [Some Reason].

## If Things Were Awesome

I advocate for thinking in terms of initiatives, problems to solve, and missions. The other day, Woody Zuill asked me:

> What would need to happen such that this wasn't even an issue. What would it take for the company to be awesome?

What would a crazy successful and awesome product development team actually look like? Probably not using Gantt-like visuals. The future might look nothing like a 12 lane LA highway. Because you'd be on a bullet train.

## Needs & Being Awesome

**Need**: "The process helps us have the right conversations"
**Awesome**: "We have the right conversations without needing a prop. We leverage the right decision making tools for the job, without bad side-effects."

**Need**: "I need to know if you're working on my favorite feature"
**Awesome**: "The product development team continuously surprises and delivers value. Pet features become far less important."

**Need**: "We have to meet to decide which features are most important"
**Awesome**: "The problem to solve is known, and all team members are empowered to solve them without drowning in meetings."

**Need**: "We need to have a yearly plan"
**Awesome**: "You always have focus, vision, and direction — not just in late December. Gaining shared understanding is a rapid process."

**Need**: "We need to know what is coming down the pike!"
**Awesome**: "The product is sellable, awesome, and valuable as is. No shaky future promises needed."

**Need**: "We need to see the big picture"
**Awesome**: "The evidence of impact is everywhere: in customer feedback, in the data, and in the dollars and cents."

Note: If you listen carefully, most "big picture" discussions are actually code for "we don't think we're making a difference".

## Conclusion

Roadmaps aren't the problem, obviously. We pick our tools and methods. My goal with this post was to encourage you to challenge the "why": why use roadmaps, why use roadmaps the way we typically use roadmaps, and what it might take to be awesome.

Consider many of the enduring debates: estimates, roadmaps, technical debt, iteration length, team structure, roles, Agile…

Why do we continue arguing about them? Perhaps because they — and the methodologies we create to control them — are symptoms and medicine for those symptoms. Dig deeper!
