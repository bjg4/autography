It's all bets, opportunities, and BAU until someone loses their job.

I made a little prioritization app. Give it a try! Desktop/laptop only for now.

Warning: This post is for people who delight in organizational language and meaning, and stress about it. It's for you if you've ever debated the merits of a "bet" over an initiative, tried valiantly to clarify concepts at your company (a tall order), care deeply about interfaces and domains, or worry about overwhelming teams with zombie processes. You have a super-radar for incoherence. You've been known to use the words Taxonomy or Ontology or Semantic Drift. If this isn't your thing, I want to stay on your good side, so maybe skip this one.

After my last post on relationships between objects, I started to feel like the objects (nouns, or nodes) needed some love.

I'm fresh off a week of awesome workshops and endless explorations of words in organizations. "Should we call them bets or initiatives, or both?" "What is a program, exactly?" "What is the job of an initiative?" "A roadmap?" "At what point does an OKR represent stable drivers?" "What is a capability, exactly?"

I've been swinging back and forth between "words are very important!" and "maybe I'm missing something?" and "maybe it really doesn't matter."

It always feels like a juggling act:

- At any meaningful scale, there will be a contingent of well-meaning people eager to turn abstract (yet helpful) ideas into concrete (and less useful) ideas.
- Even with a lot of local variation, you'll likely need some minimally viable consistency across the org for the teams to interface with each other, and with the enterprise strategy and coffers.
- Words (and related concepts) can sometimes be a Trojan horse. They have a way of creating an unlock. So there's hope!
- But you can't rename your way out of a structural problem. If interactions, behaviors, and practices don't change, the words won't either.
- In fact, semantic ambiguity, power, and influence are often related. If you can keep people guessing, then you can control the narrative.
- There's a constant tension between "calling things like they are" and then playing with a new, as-of-yet-untested future.

### Business as Usual, Bets, and Rules

Which brings us to reification—one of the primary drivers of ontological conflict in organizations.

(Reify: To treat an abstract concept, model, or idea as if it were a real, concrete thing)

**It's all bets, opportunities, and BAU until someone loses their job.**

A classic example is "BAU" vs. "strategic initiative." The line seems arbitrary. How "usual" does it need to be to be BAU? How strategic to be strategic? But when someone in finance treats "strategic initiatives" as the only real value drivers and disregards the value of BAU work, we have a problem.

No joke, this behavior and math have led to layoffs in some organizations.

The best description of this risk I've found of reification in action is in James C. Scott's Seeing Like a State. In the book, Scott describes how organizations try to simplify complex, lived, and emergent realities to make them legible, comparable, and governable from a distance. These simplifications aren't malicious and, in many cases, are necessary. The problems arise when the model designed to support administration and control is mistaken for reality itself.

### Fractal Objects

Another way to reduce confusion is to treat certain concepts as fractal.

The organization agrees on what a bet is, but accepts that bets can exist at many levels of abstraction. The core patterns and behaviors are similar, such as insight, appetite, options, and shaping, but they're performed at different scales. Leaders shape larger, strategic bets, while teams shape smaller bets within their domains.

This tactic differs from polymorphism, in which variation occurs by kind.

In a fractal model, variation occurs at different scales. A team-level bet isn't a different type of thing than a leadership-level bet; it's the same kind of thing operating under various constraints.

This approach works when it's clear which level a bet belongs to, who has the authority to shape it, and how decisions at one level constrain or inform those at another. The risk appears when bets at different levels are collapsed together, treated as roll-ups, or governed as if they all live at the same altitude.

## The Four Lenses

You can think of this as several lenses we can deliberately move between and interrogate.

#### Interaction Lens
[Object] is a container for [interactions, behaviors, decisions, or conversations].

#### Constraint Lens
[Object] is an enabling constraint meant to drive coherence around [what, specifically].

#### Governance Lens
We count, track, or report on [Object] to [make what decision, enforce what rule, or allocate what resource].

#### Relational Lens
We can understand [Object] in the context of its relationships to [teams, goals, funding, releases, customers, risks, other objects].

## Getting Actionable

### 1. Anchor on things that happen
Shift focus toward things that actually happen and are easier to reason about across levels of abstraction. Milestones happen. Pull requests happen. Releases happen.

### 2. Polymorphism via a shared abstraction
Agree on a thin base definition that captures the essence of a concept, then allow specialized forms under that definition.

### 3. Keep core definitions deliberately utilitarian
Keep certain core definitions intentionally plain and under-specified.

### 4. Fractal Objects
The organization agrees on what a bet is, but accepts that bets can exist at many levels of abstraction.

### 5. Name the exception to tame it
Sometimes the problem isn't that a word is doing too much work, but that it's failing in very specific cases.

### 6. Use fractal artifacts and rituals, not just abstract objects
Anchor work around tangible artifacts or rituals rather than purely abstract objects. Amazon's PRFAQ and six-pager are good examples.

### 7. Design for many frames, not one true categorization
The goal isn't to find the right frame. It's to make the system robust to many frames.
